# ABSTRACT

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs） play essential roles in tumor invasion and metastasis,and contribute to drug resistance. Clinical evidence suggests that TAM levels are correlated with local tumor relapse,distant metastasis,and poor prognosis in patients.In this study,we synthesized a TAM-targeted probe (IRD-αCD2o6)by conjugating a monoclonal anti-CD2O6 antibody with a near-infrared phthalocyanine dye.We then investigated the potential application of the IRD-αCD206 probe to near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and photoimmunotherapy (PIT)of tumors resistant to treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib.Sorafenib treatment had no effect on tumor growth in a 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer, but induced M2 macrophage polarization in tumors.M2 macrophage recruitment by sorafenib-treated 4T1 tumors Was noninvasively visualized by in vivo NIRF imaging of IRD-αCD206. Small-animal single-photon emisson computed tomography (SPECT)/CT and intratumoral microdistributionanalysis indicated TAM-specific localizationof the IRD-αCD2O6 probe in4T1 tumors after several rounds of sorafenib treatment. Upon light irradiation,IRD-αCD2O6 suppressed the growth of sorafenib-resistant tumors.In vivo CT imaging and ex vivo histological analysis confirmed the inhibition of lung metastasis in mice by IRD-αCD2O6 PIT.These results demonstrate the utility of the IRD-αCD206 probe for TAM-targeted diagnostic imaging and treatment of tumors that are resistant to conventional therapeutics.

# 1.Introduction

Traditional cancer treatments such as radio- and chemotherapy are associated with serious side effects and drug resistance[1]. Although there are many drugs that maximize treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity, local tumor recurrences and distant metastasis are common,and may eventually lead to drug resistance and treatment failure [2,3].

Sorafenib (BAY 43-9oo6,Nexavar) isa small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [4].It has also been investigated for the treatment of lung,breast,and other cancers [5,6].Several clinical studies have found that the patient response rate to this drug is quite low,with cancers becoming sorafenib-resistant after several rounds of therapy [7,8]. Therefore,novel treatments for tumors,especially those that are drug-resistant,are urgently needed.

During cancer development and treatment,tumors are infiltrated by myeloid cells,such as macrophages(tumor-associated macrophages;TAMs),which are recruited in their monocyte precursor form from the peripheral blood [9].TAM stimulates tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis,invasion,and metastasis, and suppressing antitumor immunity [1O,11].TAM levels are correlated with poor prognosis in various human cancers and are a major factor in the development of resistance to chemo- or radiotherapy，aswell asin tumor recurrence [12,13].Assuch, characterization of macrophage infiltration in tumors may be used to predict patient outcome and evaluate responses to therapy[14].

TAMsare typically designated as“alternatively activated"noninflammatory M2-type macrophages,in contrast to the“classicallyactivated”inflammatory“M1”type [15].TAMs can serve as therapeutic targets or markers for imaging in the evaluation of tumor progression [16].M2 macrophages specifically express CD206,also known as macrophage mannose receptor [17-19]. CD206-targeted single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) or optical imaging can potentially be used as a means of noninvasively visualizing the TAM infiltration into tumors in vivo [20,21].

Antibody- and phthalocyanine dye-based photodynamic therapy(PDT),also known as photoimmunotherapy(PIT)[22],uses the near-infrared phthalocyanine dye IRDye7Oo asa photosensitizer in conjunctionwithanantibody that servesasadeliveryvehicle for tumor-specific near-infrared fluorescence（NIRF） imaging.Upon light irradiation,PIT selectively destroysmalignant cells targeted by antibodies while sparing normal adjacent tissue.The efficacy of PIT has been demonstrated in several tumor models [23-26].

In this study,we synthesized a CD2O6-targeted PIT probe by conjugating a monoclonal anti-CD2o6 antibody with IRDye7OO and evaluated its effectiveness in vitro and in vivo.We investigated whether the PIT probe could be used to noninvasively visualize and image TAM recruitment to tumorsaswell as treat tumors that are resistant to sorafenib therapy.Our findings provide information that can be useful for predicting therapeutic response and evaluating drugresistance.

# 2.Materials and methods

# 2.1. Cell culture and animal model

The 4T1 murine breast cancer and RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with $1 0 \% \ ( \mathrm { v / v ) }$ fetal bovine serum at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ under a humidified atmosphere containing $5 \% \thinspace { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 2 }$

All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines of Peking University Animal Care and Use Committee. The 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model was established by subcutaneous injection of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ cells into the right hind legs of female BALB/c mice (5 weeksof age;Department of Laboratory Animal Science,Peking University).The tumor growth was measured using a caliper,and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula: volume $\mathrm {  ~ \underline { ~ } { ~ \sigma ~ } } = \mathrm { l e n g t h } \times \cdot \mathrm {  ~ \sigma ~ }$ width²/2.

# 2.2.Sorafenib treatment

The 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with a tumor size of $1 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ were selected forin vivo sorafenib treatment studies.A sorafenib dose of $2 0 { - } 5 0 \mathrm { m g / k g / d }$ ay has been used in other studies [27-29]. Therefore,4T1 mice were segregated into four groups ( $\mathrm { \Delta } \ln = 1 8$ per group),and were administered with O(vehicle control),2O,40,or $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ sorafenib/kg/day (in1:1 propylene glycol/water) for6 days (days O-5) by gavage.Tumor size and body weight were measured every other day.On day 6,three mice from each group were sacrificed,and their tumors were harvested.After cutting on a freezing microtome,tumor tissues were stained with an antiCD206 antibody (clone CO68C2,IgG2a;BioLegend, San Diego,CA) for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ at room temperature and then visualized with dyeconjugated secondaryantibody undera Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope (Wetzler,Heidelberg,Germany).Meanwhile,a total of10 mice from control and $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g / d a y }$ treatment groups ( $\mathbf { \dot { n } } = 5$ per group）were sacrificed and their tumors were digested to obtain single-cell suspensions for flow cytometry analysis

In separate experiments,4T1 tumor-bearing $\mathsf { B A L B } / \mathrm { c }$ mice were administered O(vehicle control) or $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ sorafenib/kg/day (in1:1 propylene glycol/water）for6 days(days O-5）by gavage.These mice were used for in vivo fluorescence and SPECT/CT imaging and in vivo PIT studies.

# 2.3.Flow cytometry analysis

Harvested tumors were minced into fragments,digested with10 $\mathrm { \Delta U / m L }$ collagenase I, $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m L }$ collagenase IV,and $3 0 \mathrm { \ U / m L }$ DNase (in phosphate buffered saline;PBS) for $^ { 1 \mathrm { h } }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ,and then passed through a $7 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ cell strainer. Single-cell suspensions were stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated rat anti-mouse $\mathrm { F } 4 / 8 0$ and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD206 antibodies (Sungene,Tianjin, China). Cells were sorted with an LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Germany).

# 2.4.Synthesis and in vitro characterization of the anti-CD2o6 prob

The CD2o6-targeting probe was generated using a previously described method[3O].Briefly，anti-CD2O6 antibody (clone C068C2，IgG2a；BioLegend，San Diego，CA）was mixed with IRDye7OO-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)(LI-COR,Inc.Lincoln,NE) in sodium bicarbonate buffer $\left( \mathsf { p H 8 . 3 } \right)$ ata $1 { : } 7 \mathrm { m o l }$ ratio.After a $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ incubation at $4 \ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ IRDye70O-conjugated antibody (IRD-αCD206) was purified usinga PD-1O desalting column (GE Healthcare,Piscataway,NJ) using PBSas themobile phage.The degree of labeling (dye/protein ratio） for IRD- $\cdot a \mathbf { C D } 2 0 6$ was calculated to be approximately 4.1 based on UV measurements.The purity of IRD-αCD206 was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)and subsequent NIRF imaging with an IVIS optical imaging system (Xenogen,Alameda, CA).An isotypematched control probe (IRD-IgG) was synthesized by conjugating rat IgG $\mathtt { \backslash I g G 2 a }$ ：BioLegend,San Diego,CA) with IRDye7OO-NHSusing the same protocol.

The immunoreactivity of IRD-αCD2O6 was evaluated relative to that of the parent antibody（αCD2o6) with a_cell binding assay. Briefly，αCD206 was radiolabeled with ${ \mathsf { N a } } ^ { 1 2 5 } { \mathsf { I } }$ to generate the radiotracer $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I } \mathrm { - }  { \alpha }  { \mathrm { C D } } 2 0 6$ using a previously described protocol [31]. The radiochemical purity of $\bar { 1 2 5 } _ { \mathrm { I -  { \alpha } C D 2 0  { 6 } } }$ after preparation was ${ > } 9 8 \%$ .CD206-positive [21] RAW264.7 cells were incubated with $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I }$ αCD206 in the presenceof increasing concentrations of IRDαCD206 and αCD2O6 in 96-well filter plates.After incubating for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ,theplateswere washed usingPBS,and thePVDF filters were collected and measured in a $\boldsymbol { \gamma }$ -counter.Data were fitted with nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 5.O(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) $( \mathsf { n } = 4 ^ { \cdot }$ ）

Singlet oxygen of IRD-αCD2O6 was measured using a singlet oxygen sensor green (SOsG) assay. Briefly, $1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$ SOSG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,CA）wasaddedto IRDye700 $( 1 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ or IRD-αCD206 0 $1 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ IRDye7oo equivalent concentration） solution,followed by irradiation with a ${ \tt 6 9 0 – n m }$ laser(Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co., Ltd.,Shanghai, China) for various times.SOsG fluorescence was measured with the IVIS optical imaging system(Xenogen,Alameda, CA）at an excitation wavelength of $4 6 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and an emission wavelength of $5 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ .In the blocking experiments,the singlet oxygen quencher ${ \mathsf { N a N } } _ { 3 }$ 1 $( 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M } )$ wasadded to the solution and singlet oxygen molecules generated by IRD-αCD2o6 were detected asdescribedabove.

# 2.5.In vivo NIRF imaging

Uptake of IRD-αCD206 by 4T1 tumors in the control or sorafenib-treated BALB/c mice Was evaluated by NIRF imaging.

Mice were treated with either the vehicle control or $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ sorafenib/kg/day for 6 days (days O-5).On day 6,each mouse ( $\mathrm { \dot { ~ } n } = 5$ per group) was administered 0.5 nmol IRD-αCD2O6 by intravenous injection,and in vivo optical imaging was performed at 4,8,and $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ postinjection (p.i.). The uptake of IRD-αCD2O6 by tumor and muscle was determined by normalizing the fluorescence intensity of the tumor by the dose injected [32,33].After the last scan at $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ p.i.,mice were sacrificed.Tumors and major organs/tissues were dissected,weighed,and ex vivo NIRF imaged. Results are presented asthe percent injected dose per gram $\scriptstyle \left( \% \operatorname { I D } / \mathbf { g } \right)$

# 2.6. Small-animal SPECT/CT imaging

4T1 tumor-bearing mice treated with either vehicle control or $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ sorafenib/kg/day for6days( $\mathbf { \dot { n } } = 3$ per group)administered $1 8 . 5 ~ \mathrm { M B q }$ of $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { { I } }$ -αCD206 by intravenous injection. After anesthetization with $2 \%$ isoflurane in oxygen,SPECTand helical CT scans of the mice were performed at $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ p.i.on a NanoScan SPECT/CT imaging system(Mediso,Budapest,Hungary) [34,35].The tumor uptake of $^ { \bar { 1 } 2 5 } \mathrm { I } .$ -αCD206 was quantified using a previously described method [36,37].

# 2.7.Evaluation of αCD2o6 microdistribution in sorafenib-treated tumors

After six days(days O-5) of sorafenib $( 6 0 \mathrm { m g / k g / d a y ) }$ treatment, 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were injected intravenously on day 6 with $5 0 \mu \mathrm { g }$ FITC-αCD206 (clone CO68C2; IgG2a; Sungene,Tianjin,China). At $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ p.i., tumors were harvested,cut on a freezing microtome, and immunolabeled with an antibody (Abcam,Cambridge,MA) against the M1/M2 macrophage marker F4/8O to determine macrophage localization.

# 2.8.Invivo PIT

4T1 tumor-bearing mice were treated with vehicle (control group, $\mathtt { n } = 1 2$ or $6 0 \mathrm { m g }$ sorafenib/kg/day for 6 days(days O-5).On day 6,sorafenib-treated mice were randomized into four groups: (1）no treatment (sorafenib group, ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 1 2$ )；（2）miceinjected intravenously with1 nmol IRD-αCD2o6 and then irradiated 8,24, and $4 8 \mathrm { h }$ p.i. at $7 0 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ with a $6 9 0 \mathrm { - n m }$ laser (PIT group, $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 1 2 \mathrm { \cdot }$ ；(3) mice injected with 1 nmol IRD-αCD206 (probe only group, $\mathtt { n } = 1 2$ ） (4)mice irradiated 8,24,and $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ p.i. at $7 0 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { \bar { 2 } }$ with a $_ { 6 9 0 - \mathrm { n m } }$ laser (light only group, ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 1 2$ ).Tumor size was measured every other day. On day10,five mice from each group were sacrificed and their tumors were harvested for histological analysis of Ki67 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL).

# 2.9.Assessmentof lung metastasis

At the end (day 16) of the in vivo PIT study, lung metastasis was assessed by high-resolution CT imagingand ex vivo examination. Mice were first scanned by CT to determine the position of the chest,and then the lungs were filled with $1 5 \%$ India ink via the upper trachea and fixed in Fekete's solution ( $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ of $70 \%$ alcohol, $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $4 \%$ formalin,and $5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ glacial acetic acid) for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ Metastatic lesions on the black lung surface were counted.Lungs were then fixed with formalin,embedded in paraffin,cut into sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

# 2.10.Immunofluorescence staining

Ki67 and TUNEL fluorescence were determined in order to evaluate the effect of PIT on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. For Ki67 staining,the frozen tumor sections were incubated with rabbit anti-Ki67(Millipore,Billerica,MA) antibody for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ at room temperature and then visualized with dyeconjugated secondary antibodies under a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope (Wetzler, Heidelberg,Germany).For TUNEL staining, the experiment was conducted by following the manual instruction of In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche,Indianapolis,IN).After staining,10 randomviews in the tumor slices were selected for the quantitative analyses.The tumor cell proliferation index and tumor apoptosis were calculated as the percentage of Ki67-positive nuclei and TUNEL-positive nuclei in relation to the total number of nuclei, respectively.

# 2.11.Validation of PIT specificity

The specificity of IRD-αCD2O6 PIT for TAMs Was evaluated invitro and in vivo.For in vitro studies，CD2O6-positive RAW264.7 cells or CD206-negative [21] 4T1 tumor cells were incubated with $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ IRD-αCD206 for $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ After washing with PBS,cells were irradiated at O,5,and $1 0 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ with a $_ { 6 9 0 - \mathrm { n m } }$ laser.Propidium iodide $( 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ； Sigma-Aldrich,St.Louis,MO) was added to stain dead cells,which were sorted by flow cytometry. For in vivo studies,4T1 tumor-bearing mice were injected intravenously with PBS,1 nmol of IRD-αCD206 or1 nmol of IRD-IgG and then irradiated at 8,24,and $4 8 \mathrm { h }$ p.i. at $7 0 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ with a $_ { 6 9 0 - \mathrm { n m } }$ laser ( $\mathbf { \dot { n } } = 3$ per group).Mice were then sacrificed and their tumors were dissected,cut with a freezing microtome,and immunolabeled with an antibody against F4/8O (to identify macrophages）and evaluated with the TUNEL assay (to identify apoptotic cells）as describedabove.

# 2.12.Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 5.O software (GraphPad Software Inc.)and values are presented as mean $\pm \mathsf { S D }$ Statistical analysis was done using a 1-way ANOvA for multiple groups and an unpaired Student's t test. $P$ values $< 0 . 0 5$ were considered statistically significant.

# 3. Results

# 3.1.Sorafenib treatment hasno effecton4T1 tumor growth

We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib in a 4T1 tumormodel.After treatment for6 days,sorafenib administered at doses of $2 0 { - } 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g }$ had negligible effects on tumors (Fig.1A). There was no reduction in body weight at any dose,suggesting that the treatment was not toxic to mice (Fig.1B).

However,sorafenib increased the number of $\mathrm { C D } 2 0 6 ^ { + } \mathrm { F } 4 / 8 0 ^ { + } \mathrm { M } 2$ 1 macrophages and decreased the number of $\Sigma _ { Ḋ } 2 0 6 Ḍ ^ { - } \mathtt { F } 4 / 8 0 ^ { + }$ M1 macrophages relative to size-matched controls (Fig.1C,D).These results indicate the repolarization of TAMs and their recruitment to sorafenib-treated tumors.Inaddition,the M2/M1 ratio was higher for sorafenib-treated as compared to control tumors ( $6 5 . 7 4 \pm 9 . 1 7$ VS. $4 5 . 1 7 \pm 7 . 4 8$ $P < 0 . 0 1 \$ ; Fig. 1E).

# 3.2.PreparationofaTAM-targetedprobe

Due to increased M2 macrophage recruitment by sorafenibtreated 4T1 tumors,we hypothesized that CD2o6 could serve as a biomarker for 4T1 tumors after sorafenib treatment and that a CD206-specific probe would be useful for imaging and therapeutic targeting of sorafenib-treated tumors.We prepared the IRDαCD206 probe by conjugating an anti-CD2o6 monoclonal antibody witha photosensitive near-infrared phthalocyanine dye (Fig. 2A).

The purity of the probe was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and NIRF imaging (Fig.2B).A competitive cell-binding assay with CD206- positiveRAW264.7 cellsrevealedthatIRD-αCD206 （204 $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } = 1 1 . 8 2 \pm 3 . 4 4 ~ \mathrm { n M } )$ ）had CD2o6-binding affinity that was similar to that of the unmodified antibody $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } = 8 . 7 5 \pm 1 . 9 7 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ Fig. 2C).

We measured the singlet oxygen molecules of IRD-αCD206 in PBS solution.As shown in Fig.2D,E,the singlet oxygen generated after irradiation Was increased for both IR7OO and IRD-αCD206;

these showed near-identical singlet oxygen generation.However, this was significantly inhibited by quenching with ${ \mathsf { N a N } } _ { 3 }$ .These results confirmed the potential utility of IRD-αCD2O6 for in vitro and in vivo PIT applications.

# 3.3.In vivo targeting of tumors by IRD-αCD206

We investigated whether M2 macrophage recruitment by sorafenib-treated tumors can be noninvasively visualized by in vivo small-animal imaging using the IRD-αCD2o6 probe. Representative NIRF images of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice with orwithout sorafenib treatment were examined at different time points after IRDαCD206 injection (Fig.3A).Subcutaneous tumors were detected from 4 to $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ p.i.in both control and sorafenib-treated mice. However, the fluorescence intensity of IRD-αCD2O6 was significantly higher for sorafenib-treated as compared to control tumors at4( $5 . 8 2 \pm 0 . 3 8 \%$ VS. $4 . 8 5 \pm 0 . 1 5 \%$ ： $P < 0 . 0 1 \$ ),8 $\langle 9 . 2 0 \pm 2 . 2 6 \%$ VS. $5 . 9 8 \pm 0 . 7 6 \%$ ： $P < 0 . 0 5$ ）and24 $( 9 . 1 7 \pm 1 . 9 7 \%$ VS. $5 . 7 3 \pm 1 . 4 9 \%$ $\textstyle P < 0 . 0 5 { \mathrm { ! } }$ )hp.i.(Fig.3B).Tumor-to-muscle IRD-αCD206 ratioswere also higher in sorafenib-treated tumors than in controls at 4 $( 3 . 1 3 \pm 0 . 4 4$ VS. $2 . 0 8 \pm 0 . 1 5$ $P < 0 . 0 1 \$ 0，8 $\left. 4 . 9 8 \pm 1 . 0 1 \right.$ VS. $3 . 3 6 \pm 0 . 3 2$ $P < 0 . 0 1 _ { \cdot } ^ { \cdot }$ ，and24 $\cdot 4 . 2 1 \pm 0 . 4 9$ vs. $2 . 6 0 \pm 0 . 8 7$ ： $P < 0 . 0 5$ ）hp.i. (Fig.3C). These results indicate that more IRD-αCD2O6 is taken up bysorafenib-treated as compared to untreated tumors.The uptake of IRD-αCD2o6 in the sorafenib-treated tumors was also significantly higher than that of IRD-IgG at all-time points examined 0 $\ P < 0 . 0 5$ ; Fig. S1), demonstrating the CD206-specific targeting of IRD-αCD206.

To validate the in vivo NIRF imaging results,tumors were analyzed by ex vivo NIRF imaging and small-animal $\mathsf { S P E C T / C T }$ As shown in Fig.3D,E,IRD-αCD2O6 uptake by organs was similar between sorafenib-treated and control mice;however, probe uptake was greater in tumors treated with sorafenib $( 7 . 7 3 \pm 1 . 0 7 \% \mathrm { { I D } } /$ g)as compared to controls $\langle 4 . 7 1 \pm 0 . 2 9 \% \mathrm { D } / \mathrm { g }$ 1 $\textstyle P < 0 . 0 5 ^ { \prime }$ )

Radionuclides are more quantitative than fluorescent dyes,and their in vivo distribution can be accurately and non-invasively quantified by SPECT imaging.We validated the results obtained by NIRF imaging of IRD-αCD2O6 by evaluating its radioactive counterpart $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I } \mathrm { - }  { \alpha }  { \mathrm { C D } } 2 0 6$ ，which was predominantly taken up by the liver(Fig. 4A）due to hepatic clearance.The probe showed increased accumulation in tumors in sorafenib-treated mice compared to that in the control mice(Fig. 4A). Tomographic imaging revealed a variable distribution of $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I } \mathrm { - }  { \alpha }  { \mathrm { C D } } 2 0 6$ in sorafenibtreated 4T1 tumors (Fig.4B),reflecting the heterogeneous localization of TAMs.The quantification results confirmed that the uptake of $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I }$ -αCD206 in the sorafenib-treated tumorswas significantly higher than that in the control tumors $\mathit { \Omega } ^ { \prime } P \mathit { \Theta } < 0 . 0 1$ Fig. 4C).

IRD-αCD2O6 PIT of the control tumors without sorafenib treatment showed a remarkable suppression on tumor growth (Fig.S2), which confirms the antitumor effect of PIT. However,the therapy efficacyof IRD-αCD2O6 PIT is generally limited dueto the low expression of CD2o6 in control tumors.We next investigated whether IRD-αCD2O6 could be used for in vivo PIT studies of sorafenib-treated tumors(Fig.5A),which is supposed to express much higher CD2O6 compared to the control tumors (Fig.1C,D,E). Asshown in Fig.5B,a time-dependent increase in tumor size was observedin4T1tumorstreatedwithvehicle, sorafenib, sorafenib $^ +$ light,and sorafenib $^ +$ IRD-αCD206 only.In contrast,a single injection of IRD-αCD2o6 followed by irradiationat 8,24,or $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ p.i. significantly delayed tumor growth relative to the other groups from days 10-16.

We next carried out Ki67 immunolabeling and the TUNEL assay to assess tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis,respectively.As shown in Fig.5C,the proliferation index was decreased whereas the apoptosis index was increased in the sorafenib $^ +$ IRD-αCD206PITas compared to control groups ( $P < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; Fig.5D,E), demonstrating the efficacy of IRD-αCD2O6 PIT for treating sorafenib-resistant 4T1 tumors.

Subcutaneous injection of 4T1 tumor cells in mice results in metastasis to the lungs [21].We therefore assessed whether IRDαCD2O6 PIT can inhibit metastasis of sorafenib-resistant tumors by CT imaging.In control,sorafenib,sorafenib $^ +$ light only,and sorafenib $+ \ 1 8 \mathrm { D } { - } \alpha \mathrm { C D } 2 0 6$ only groups,evident metastatic lesions were detected in the lungs;these were negligible in mice in the sorafenib $^ +$ IRD-αCD2O6 PIT group (Fig. 6A). These findings were confirmed upon gross examination of lung lesions and by staining lung tissue sections with H&E(Fig.6B，C).Mice in the sorafenib $^ +$ IRD-αCD2O6 PIT group had fewer tumors than those in the control, sorafenib,sorafenib $^ +$ light only,and sorafenib $^ +$ IRDαCD206 only groups ( $\cdot P < 0 . 0 5$ ; Fig.6D). These results suggest that TAM-specific PIT can inhibit tumor metastasis to the lungs.

# 3.5.IRD-αCD206 PIT targets TAMs in sorafenib-resistant tumors

Although IRD-αCD2O6 PIT prevented lung metastasisof sorafenib-treated 4T1 tumors,the inhibitory effect on subcutaneous tumors was limited;that is,the treatment did not completely prevent tumor growth (Fig.5B).We hypothesized that one reason for the low efficacy is that target cells (i.e.，M2 macrophages) constitute a very small population within the tumors,and photoactivation of IRD-αCD2O6 is targeted to CD206-positive areas.We therefore compared the cell-ablating capacity of the probe in CD206-positive and -negative cells.Radiation dose-dependent toxicity was observed in CD206-positive RAW264.7 cells (Fig.7A). However, there was no apoptosis observed in CD2o6-negative 4T1 cellsafterirradiation (Fig. 7A).

Tumor-bearing mice were then subjected to IRD-αCD206 PIT, and apoptotic areas of tumor tissues were examined.As shown in Fig.7B, C,a significantly greater number $( P < 0 . 0 1 )$ of apoptotic cells Were detected in IRD-αCD2O6 PIT as compared to control and IRDIgG PIT-treated tumors.Importantly,most apoptotic(TUNEL-positive）nuclei in IRD-αCD2O6 PIT-treated tumors were associated with macrophages showing F4/8O expression at the cell surface. It should be noted that apoptotic tumor cells that are engulfed in macrophages mayalso be stained by TUNEL and then colocalized withF4/8o.However,analmost undetectable cell(both tumor cells and macrophages） apoptosis was observed in the control tumor that was not treated with IRD-αCD2O6 PIT (Fig. 7B,C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that IRD-αCD2o6 PIT can specifically destroy macrophages in the tumor.

# 4.Discussion

In this study we synthesized a probe (IRD-αCD2O6) targeting sorafenib-resistant tumors and investigated whether it can be used to visualize TAM recruitment and for PIT.We found that TAM recruitment to tumors treated with sorafenib can be detected by IRD-αCD206 NIRF imaging，and that IRD-αCD2O6 PIT inhibited subcutaneous 4T1 tumor growth and lung metastasis.

We used a 4T1 syngeneic tumor mouse model for in vivo sorafenib treatment. By measuring tumor growth after 6 days of sorafenib treatment,no statistical difference between the tumor sizes with or without sorafenib treatment was observed.In recent studies,Farsaci,etal. [38] observed that7days of sorafenib treatment had limited effect on the growth of 4T1 tumors,and only a long-term treatment could lead to the tumor responses to sorafenib.Hammond et al.[39] also demonstrated that sorafenib treatment did not prolong the survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice compared to the vehicle control group.These results suggest that 4T1 tumors are resistant to sorafenib treatment.

It is thought that tumor hypoxia following sorafenib treatment plays an essential role in the development of resistance to the drug [7,40,41].We found that sorafenib had no effect on tumor growth after6 days of treatment,but increased hypoxia relative to control tumors (Fig.S3),which can lead to the recruitment and activation ofvarious myeloid cells including TAMs[42]. Several studies have demonstrated the recruitment ofmacrophages after antiangiogenic therapy or chemotherapy[2,43].Our study focuses on M2-type macrophage,which is one of the key factors for tumor progression and therapy resistance.The observed increase in M2 macrophage infiltration and CD2o6 expression in 4T1 tumors treated with sorafenib suggested that CD2O6 could serve as a marker for TAMinfiltration of tumorsaswell asa target for PIT. In vivo NIRF imaging revealed the accumulation of TAMs in tumors after sorafenib treatment.Given the limitations of planar optical imaging for deep tissue imaging and quantification of fluorescence intensity,we synthesized a radiolabeled analog of IRD-αCD206, namely $\mathsf { \tilde { 1 } 2 5 _ { I - \alpha C D 2 0 6 } }$ ,and evaluated its distribution by small-animal SPECT/CT imaging. The results were in accordance with the optical

imaging data,and demonstrated the localization of $^ { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { I }$ -αCD206in 4T1 tumors.We also confirmed that FITC-αCD2O6 specifically labeled TAMs.FITC-αCD2O6 showed only partial overlap with the F4/80(marker of both M1 and M2 macrophages [44]) signal,which is likely due to the fact that FITC-αCD2O6 is specific to M2 and not M1 macrophages.

Metastasis is one of the major causes of mortality in cancer patients；evidence suggests that TAMs promote distant tumor metastasis [11,44].By in vivo CT and ex vivo examination,we observed that the metastasis of subcutaneously inoculated 4T1 tumor cells to the lungswas significantly blocked by depletion of TAMs by IRD-αCD2O6 PIT. These results demonstrated the antimetastatic effect of TAM-targeted PIT. Despite robust antimetastatic effect,the efficacy of IRD-αCD2O6PIT in subcutaneous 4T1 tumors treated with sorafenib was sub-optimal,as tumor growth was not entirely eliminated (Fig.5B).There are two possible reasons for these results.Firstly, IRD-αCD2O6 targeted TAMs,which represent a small subset of cells in 4T1 tumors,resulting in low uptake of the probe by the tumor,which in turn reduces the effects of PIT;thatis,irradiation eliminated only TAMs and not tumor cells. Secondly, like PDT, the effectiveness of PIT depends on the photosensitizer,light,and oxygen[45];therefore,the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (Fig. S3) of sorafenib-treated 4T1 tumors may reduce the effectiveness of PIT due to a lack of oxygen.

After sorafenib treatment and subsequent CD2O6-targeted PIT,it did not cause an evident tumor sensitivity to the second rounds of sorafenib treatment (Fig. S4). These results suggest that IRDαCD2O6 PIT has limited effect on the reversal of 4T1 tumor resistance to sorafenib. Chen et al.[7] demonstrated that one of the mechanismsunderlying sorafenib resistance is the increased tumor hypoxiaafter sorafenib treatment.Increased hypoxia results in the recruitment and activation of multiple myeloid and lymphoid immune suppressor cells,including M2-type macrophages,myeloidderived suppressor cells,and T-regulatorycells.Therefore,depletion of M2-type macrophages only(as we used in this study by IRDαCD206 PIT) may not be sufficient to overcome tumor resistance to sorafenib.

Radiotherapy or chemotherapy with drugs other than sorafenib can also lead to the recruitment of TAMs by resistant tumors [2,46,47].As such,the present findings can be extended to PIT of tumors treated with other therapies.In addition,several recent studies have shown the synergistic effect of sorafenib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for enhanced antitumor efficacy byactivating the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and boosting host antitumor immunity [7,48].PDT has also been reported to be effective on immunopotentiation [45]. Therefore, future studies investigating the combination of PIT and immune checkpoint inhibition to overcome tumor resistance to sorafenib therapyis highlydesirable.

# 5.Conclusion

The results of this study demonstrated that several rounds of sorafenib treatment can lead to M2 macrophage polarization in 4T1 tumors.The recruitment of TAMs by tumors was noninvasively visualized by NIRF imaging of the IRD-αCD2O6 probe.Upon irradiation, IRD-αCD2o6 PIT inhibited the growth of subcutaneous 4T1 tumors and prevented their metastasis to the lungs.These results suggest that TAM-targeted PIT is a promising strategy for treating tumors that are resistant to conventional drugs.
