Abstract: Biochar addition can improve the physical and hydraulic characteristics of sandy soil. This study investigated the effects of biochar on water holding capacity and water movement in sandy soil under drip irrigation. By indoor simulation experiments, the effects of biochar application at five levels $( 0 \% , 1 \% , 2 \% ,$ （204号 $4 \%$ and $6 \%$ ） on the soil water retention curve,infiltration characteristics of drip irrigation and water distribution were tested and analyzed.The results showed that biochar addition rate was positively correlated with water holding capacity of sandy soil and soil available water. Within the same infiltration time, with an increasing amount of added biochar,the diffusion distance of the horizontal wetting front (HWF) tended to decrease,while the infiltration distance of vertical weting front (VWF) initially declined and then rose. The features of wetted bodies changed from "broad-shallow" to "narrow-deep" type. The relationship between the transport distances of HWF and VWF and the infiltration time was described by a power function.At the same distance from the point source,the larger the amount of added biochar,the higher the soil water content. Biochar had a great influence on the water content of the layer with biochar(O-200 mm) and had some effects at $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ without biochar;but it had less influence on the soil water content deeper than $2 5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ . For the application rate of biochar of $4 \%$ ,most water was retained within $0 -$ $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ soil layer. However, when biochar application amount was high $( 6 \% )$ , it would be helpful for water infiltration. During the improvement of sandy soil, biochar application rate of $4 \%$ in the plow layer had the best effect.

# 1 Introduction

Globally,land desertification is a serious environmental problem. China is one of the countries with the most serious desertification.By 2O14, the desertified land area had reached $1 . 7 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } ~ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ in China (SFA PRC, 2O14). Land desertification will cause soil texture deterioration, organic matter content reduction, soil structure destruction and water and fertilizer leakage,leading to low soil productivity.

Biochar,known as "black gold" in international academic,was made from organic waste generated in agricultural production through pyrolysis at moderate temperatures (Antal and Gronli,

2003). It has high carbon content, rich pore structure,large specific surface area, various organic functional groups contained (or absorbed) on the surface, strong ion exchange adsorption capacity and stable physicochemical properties. Biochar addition to sandy soil was considered to improve a range of soil physical and hydraulic properties including soil bulk density (Githinji,2O14; Suliman et al.,2017; Ahmed et al., 2018), soil hydraulic conductivity (Uzoma et al.,2011; Ibrahim et al., 2013; Barnes et al.,2014; Liu et al.,2016; Jacka et al.,2018), water infiltration rate (Ibrahim et al., 2013;Githinji,2014),soil hydrophobicity (Ibrahim et al.，2013)，soil water holding capacity (Dugan et al.,2010; Karhu et al.,2011; Devereux et al.,2012; Liu et al.,2016; Suliman et al.,2017; Al-Wabel et al.,2018),and soil available water (Baronti et al.,2014; Bruun et al., 2014; Glab et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2016),as wel as crop properties including crop production (Faloye et al., 2017; She et al., 2018)，water use efficiency (Xiao et al.,2018) and crop drought resistance (Poormansour and Razzaghi,2018). The application ofbiochar improves the physical and hydraulic characteristics of sandy soil (Karhu et al.,2O11) and has direct efects on soil water movement. Ibrahim (2Ol3） found that the transport distance of weting fronts shortened gradually with increased amounts of applied biochar. The transport distance and timing of wetting fronts accorded with a power function (Qi et al.,2015). The Philip infiltration model can be used to describe the changing process of water infiltration in soil with added biochar (Xiao et al.,2O15). However, using test results for silty clay loam, Li et al. (2016) suggested that a moderate amount of biochar could reduce the transport velocity of wetting fronts,but a higher amount $( 4 \% )$ could promote their downward transport. Therefore, researchers studied one-dimensional infiltration of soil mixed with biochar and found that the amount of biochar applied and soil texture were two key factors affecting water movement. Nevertheless,under conditions of water saving, there are few reports on the effects of biochar on three-dimensional water movement in soil. Xu et al. (2O15） showed that biochar addition to clay,under conditions of moistube irrigation, remarkably decreased cumulative infiltration capacity, restrained upward water transport and promoted lateral and downward water transport.

Drip irrigation is a high-efficiency water-saving irrigation technique. It has a significant effect on relieving the shortage of agricultural water resource and improving the irrigation water use effciency. It is very popular and has a large potential application in developing water-saving agriculture (Han et al.,2Ol5). However, there had been litle research on the influence of biochar on soil water movement under drip irrgation,and there is a lack of understanding of the infiltration characteristics of drip irrigation water in sandy soil and water distribution with biochar addition. Therefore, the purposes of this study are to set up a gradient of different biochar application rates, to study the effects ofbiochar on water holding capacity and water movement characteristics under drip irrigation, and to propose appropriate biochar application rate under drip irrigation in the improvement of sandy soil. The results could provide some theoretical basis for study of mechanisms of water migration in "biochar-drip irigation-sandy soil-crop" systems,and also provide data support for the popularization and utilization of biochar in sandy soil.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1Experimental methods

Experiments were conducted from October 2017 to January 2018 at the Key Laboratory of Northwest Oasis Agriculture Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Soil Fertilizer and Agricultural Water Saving, Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences of China. The test equipment comprised three main parts: soil box, Markov bottle and medical infusion apparatus (Fig.1). The soil box was a cube( $( 5 6 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } { \times } 5 6 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } { \times } 5 8 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ ） and was made of $8 \mathrm { - m m }$ thick transparent organic glasses.The Markov bottle was used to provide a constant water pressure. The drip irrigation emiter was simulated by medical infusion apparatus, with the infusion tube connected to a Markov bottle. The drip discharge was adjusted to $1 . 3 5 \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { h }$ by the regulating valve of the infusion tube.

In the experiment, five treatments were set for biochar addition rate at $0 \%$ (BCO; the control), $1 \%$ (BC1), $2 \%$ (BC2), $4 \%$ (BC4) and $6 \%$ (BC6). There were 3 replicates for each treatment.

The biochar used was a cotton straw biochar product of the Institute of Soil Fertilizer and Agricultural Water Saving, Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences.Firstly, cotton stalks (water content $< 3 0 \%$ ）were broken into short sections of $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ ； then, they were heated to $4 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at a heating rate of $5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / \mathrm { m i n }$ in the carbonization furnace,and maintained at $4 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $3 . 3 \mathrm { h }$ ; finally, the biochar was cooled under anaerobic conditions for at least $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ . The carbon yield of cotton straw was about $50 \%$ . The biochar was ground and passed through a $1 { - } \mathrm { m m }$ sieve. The physical-chemical properties of cotton stalk and biochar are listed in Table 1.

The sandy soil used was collected from the soil improvement experiment station of the $1 2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ Regiment of the $8 ^ { \mathrm { { t h } } }$ Division of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, located in the southern rim of Junggar Basin ( $( 4 4 ^ { \circ } 4 8 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N } .$ $8 5 ^ { \circ } 3 4 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ . Soil from the surface layer of $0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ was collected, dried naturally and passed through a $2 \mathrm { - m m }$ sieve. The soil texture grade was sandy soil, containing $0 . 2 7 \%$ clay, $2 . 5 8 \%$ silt and $9 7 . 1 5 \%$ sand.According to the designed soil mass ratio, biochar was added into sandy soil to form mixed soils. The bulk density and particle size of the mixed soils are shown in Table 2.

# 2.2 Experimental process

The sandy soil was backfilled into the bottom layer( $2 0 0 { - } 5 8 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ ）of the soil box by the bulk density of $1 . 5 4 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ , while the mixed soil with biochar was backfilled to the surface layer (O-20 mm) by the weighted bulk density (Table 2). Each layer of soil was $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ thick. We carried out coarsen treatment between layers to avoid the structure generated among the soil layers and altering of hydrodynamic characteristics.

We took 1/4 of wetted body of drip irrgation as the research object in this experiment. The drip irrigation emitter was fixed at $1 0 \mathrm { m m }$ above the point source O,which is one corner of the soil box, to enable observation of the dynamic migration of the vertical weting front (VWF) (Li, 2017). The tap water was used for the drip irrigation. In each test, the irigation amount and emitter discharge remained unchanged, with $4 . 0 5 \mathrm { ~ L ~ }$ and $1 . 3 5 ~ \mathrm { L / h }$ ，respectively. The drip irrigation was applied for $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and then the soil surface was immediately covered by thin film to prevent evaporation. The water in wetted bodies was allowed to redistribute for another $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ During the whole test process,the time was recorded by a stopwatch. The horizontal wetting front (HWF) in the $x y$ -plane and VWF in the $x z$ -plane were recorded at different time periods (1,2, 3,4,6, 8,10, 15,20,25,30,40,50,60,70,80,100,120,140,160,190 and $3 6 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ). With the origin at the point O, the position lines at angles of $0 . 0 ^ { \circ }$ (O-A), $2 2 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ (O-B), $4 5 . 0 ^ { \circ }$ (O-C), $6 7 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ (O-D) and $9 0 . 0 ^ { \circ }$ (O-E) with the $x$ -axis were marked, respectively. At different time, the transport distances of HWF in five directions (O-Ato O-E) were measured directly using a ruler (Fig. 2). The transport distance in the $_ { \mathrm { O - C } }$ direction was chosen as the diffusion length of HWF. On the side wall ( $x z$ -plane) of the soil box,the migration trace of VWF was marked. After the test, the transport distances of VWF in nine directions (O-A to $_ { \mathrm { O - I } }$ were determined (Fig. 2). The migration distance in the $_ { \mathrm { O - I } }$ direction served as the infiltration distance of VWF in the test.To understand the characteristics of moisture distribution in wet soil,14 monitoring points (Fig.2) were designed on the horizontal plane (xyplane)and stratified sampling in the vertical direction.The interval between layers was $5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ until the dry-wet boundary.

# 2.3 Observation index and analysis methods

Soil water content was regularly measured using the gravimetric method. Soil samples were collected from soil moisture monitoring points and dried at $1 0 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $8 \mathrm { h }$ . The measurement range of the electronic scale used was $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { g }$ with an accuracy of $0 . 0 1 \ \mathrm { g }$ . Soil moisture was calculated by Equation 1 (Wang et al., 2017):

$$
\theta { = } \frac { m _ { \mathrm { w } } - m _ { \mathrm { d } } } { m _ { \mathrm { d } } } \times 1 0 0 \% ,
$$

where $\theta$ is the soil water content $( \% ) ; m _ { \mathrm { w } }$ is the mass of wet soil $( \mathbf { g } )$ ; and $m _ { \mathrm { d } }$ is the mass of dry soil (g).

The soil water retention curves were measured by centrifuge method (Dong et al., 2016). Before the test, five mixed soils with $0 \%$ ， $1 \%$ $2 \%$ 5 $4 \%$ and $6 \%$ biochar were added into the cutting ring (5 cm in height and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ in volume), respectively,according to the bulk density (Table 2). Three repeated samples were taken for each mixed soil. The height of the sample was not easy to exceed $80 \%$ of the cutting ring height. Each mixed soil was repeated three times. The filled cuting rings were saturated in thin distilled water layer (about $3 \mathrm { c m }$ )foratleast $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ 、After the sample reached full saturation, the water outside the cuting ring was removed and the sample was weighed. The soil samples to be measured were put into the centrifuge device. The centrifuge speed was set according to the designed soil suction (0.0, 88.8, 340.0, 530.3, 859.0, 1053.0, 3018.0, 5216.0, 7189.0 and $1 5 { , } 3 0 0 . 0 \mathrm { c m } )$ ,and the centrifuge temperature was constant at $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .At the end of each centrifugation, the total soil weight and the distance from the soil surface to the top of the cutting ring were measured. After the whole process was completed, the samples were dried and weighed to calculate the soil mass water content at various rotational speeds.At the same time, the soil volumetric water content was calculated according to the relationship between the soil volumetric water content and the soil gravimetric water content (Xing et al., 2015).

The four hydrodynamic parameters in the Van-Genuchten model (Eq. 2) were determined by the nonlinear curve fiting method in the software Origin Pro2018C (OriginLab Corporation Northamton, MA 01060 USA).

$$
\theta { = } \frac { \theta _ { \mathrm { s } } - \theta _ { \mathrm { r } } } { \left[ 1 + \left| \alpha h \right| ^ { n } \right] ^ { m } } + \theta _ { \mathrm { r } } ,
$$

where $\theta$ is the volumetric water content $( \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ：， $\theta _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $\theta _ { \mathrm { r } }$ are the saturated and residual soil water content $( \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ,respectively; $a$ is a shape parameter related to the inverse of the air-entry pressure $( 1 / \mathrm { c m } )$ ·， $h$ is the negative pressure (cm); $n$ is a shape parameter related to the pore-size distribution; and $m$ is the empirical constant affecting the shape of the retention curve and equals to $1 { - } 1 / n$ (Ibrahim et al., 2013).

The soil available water (SAW; $\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ ) was the moisture which could be effectively used by the plant in the soil, that is, the difference between the field capacity (FC)and permanent wilting point (PWP). The calculation formula is:

$$
\mathrm { S A W } { = } { \theta } _ { \mathrm { F C } } - { \theta } _ { \mathrm { P W P } } ,
$$

where $\theta _ { \mathrm { F C } }$ and $\theta _ { \mathrm { P W P } }$ are the volumetric water contents $( \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } )$ at $- 1 0 0$ and $- 1 5 { , } 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ (Hardie et al., 2014), respectively.

The particle size was determined by laser particle size analyzer. The organic mater was determined by potassium dichromate oxidation-external heating method. The organic carbon was measured using $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 7 } { \cdot } \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ oxidation at $1 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 1 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ followed by titration with $\mathrm { F e S O _ { 4 } }$ solution of $0 . 2 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ ,and the alkali-hydrolysis nitrogen was determined by the diffusion method. Rapid available phosphorus was determined by ${ \mathrm { N a H C O } } _ { 3 }$ solution of $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { \ m o l / L }$ leachingmolybdenum-antimony colorimetric method. The available potassium was determined by $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } O A c }$ （204号 solution of $1 . 0 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ extraction and flame photometry (Lu, 2000).

Single-factor analysis of variance was applied to the soil hydraulic property parameters and the infiltration test results.Microsoft Excel 2016, Surfer 13.2.438,IBM SPSS 19.0,AutoCAD 2016 and OriginPro 2018C (OriginLab Corporation Northamton, MA O1060 USA） were used in the statistical analysis and plotting.

# 3 Results

# 3.1Effects of biochar on water holding capacity of sandy soil

It can be seen from Figure 3 that under the same suction condition, the larger the amount of biochar added,the higher the soil water content. This suggests that biochar improved the water holding capacity of sandy soil.As can be seen from Table 3,the correlation coefficient of the fitted curve under each treatment is greater than O.98.Therefore, it can be seen that the fitting degree of the parameters of the Van-Genuchten model meets the requirements,and the meaning of the parameters in the model can be used to explain the variation law of the soil water retention curves. By comparing with the control (BCO), biochar application had less effects on $a$ and $n$ $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ ,but had significant effects on $\theta _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $\theta _ { \mathrm { r } }$ .Specifically, the $\theta _ { \mathrm { s } }$ increased by $3 . 6 0 \%$ 0 $4 . 9 8 \%$ and $7 . 2 6 \%$ ,and the $\theta _ { \mathrm { r } }$ increased by $6 . 5 2 \%$ ， $2 9 . 9 7 \%$ and $3 5 . 6 6 \%$ for BC2,BC4 and BC6,respectively. The biochar application increased the water content at suctions of $- 1 0 0 \mathrm { c m }$ (FC) and $- 1 5 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { c m }$ (PWP). SAW (Table 3） of each treatment increased by $2 . 3 2 \%$ (BC1), $3 . 4 9 \%$ (BC2), $3 . 8 4 \%$ (BC4) and $6 . 2 7 \%$ (BC6) compared to the control BCo. Thus, the biochar application effectively increased SAW (Dugan et al., 2010; Karhu et al., 2011; Hansen et al., 2016).

# 3.2Effects of biochar on infiltration characteristics of drip irrigation

Figure 4 presents the effects of biochar on the HWF diffusion. Figures 4a and b are the contrast analysis diagrams of HWF in the case of dripping within $1 0 \ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ and the whole process, respectively.The overalltrend was that, within the same infiltration time,as the biochar addition rate increased， the diffusion distance of HWF gradually declined in the order of $\mathrm { B C 0 } { > } \mathrm { B C } 1 { > } \mathrm { B C } 2 { > } \mathrm { B C } 4 { > } \mathrm { B C } 6 ,$ .Thus,the biochar addition reduced water diffusivity in the horizontal direction. With increased biochar addition rate, VWF initially decreased and then increased as the order of $\mathrm { B C } 6 { \scriptstyle > } \mathrm { B C } 0 { \scriptstyle > } \mathrm { B C } 1 { \scriptstyle > } \mathrm { B C } 2 { \scriptstyle > } \mathrm { B C } 4$ (Fig. 5).When the biochar additive proportion was low $( \leq 4 \% )$ , there was a negative correlation between VWF and biochar addition rate. However, with the higher biochar addition rate $( 6 \% )$ ，VWF was obviously higher than that with the lower biochar addition rate $( \leq 4 \% )$ . Thus,a certain biochar addition rate contributed to restraining vertical water infiltration, but excess biochar addition increased vertical water infiltration. A power function, $D { = } { \bf a } t ^ { \mathrm { b } }$ 0 $D$ ， the distance of HWF or VWF; $t _ { : }$ ，the time corresponding to the migration distance of HWF or VWF; and a and b are the curve fiting parameters), was fitted to allthe relationships of infiltration time with transport distances of HWF and VWF, with $R ^ { 2 }$ values ${ > } 0 . 8 6$ (Table 4).

To understand the effect of biochar on the characteristics of wetted bodies in sandy soil under drip irrigation, we compared the ratios HWF to VWF for the treatments. The ratios of each treatment tended to decrease with the infiltration time (Fig. 6).Thus,in the infiltration process, the decrease of migration rate of HWF was relatively greater than that of vertical infiltration rate.There were obvious differences in the critical time points (BC0( $( 9 3 \ \mathrm { \ m i n } ) { > } \mathrm { B C } 1$ $( 8 0 \ \mathrm { m i n } ) { > } \mathrm { B C } 2$ (62 $\scriptstyle \operatorname* { m i n } ) > \mathrm { B C } 4$ $( 5 4 \ \mathrm { m i n } ) { > } \mathrm { B C } 6$ $( 6 ~ \mathrm { m i n } )$ ）at which the ratio of each treatment was equal to 1.This indicates that the biochar addition significantly affected the features of wetted bodies.Within the same infiltration time,the larger the amount of added biochar, the smaller the ratio.At the moment of ceasing the drip irrigation, compared with BCO, the ratios reduced by $1 . 3 7 \%$ $2 . 4 1 \%$ 0 $4 . 7 1 \%$ and $2 1 . 9 1 \%$ under BC1, BC2, BC4 and BC6 (Fig. 7),respectively. At the end of water redistribution (3 h after drip irrigation ceasing), the ratios reduced by $4 . 2 7 \%$ ， $7 . 0 9 \%$ ， $1 0 . 9 3 \%$ and $2 5 . 0 4 \%$ under BC1，BC2， BC4 and BC6,respectively.For the BC6 treatment, the reduction was the most remarkable, mainly due to minimum difusion distance in the horizontal direction and maximum infiltration distance in the vertical direction (Figs. 4 and 5). Therefore, with the increased amount of biochar added, the features of wetted bodies formed by drip irrigation in sandy soil changed from "broad-shallow" to "narrow-deep" type.

# 3.3 Effects of biochar on distribution of soil water

The effects of different biochar addition rates on water distribution ( $3 \mathrm { h }$ after ceasing drip irigation) in wetted bodies were analyzed. The soil layer at a depth of $1 5 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ was chosen for typical analysis. The reason is that this layer was the layer of soil that was mixed with biochar with relatively large water content,and in the other soil layers,the water distribution characteristics were similar. Figure 8 shows the contour maps of water distribution in the horizontal direction of the soil layer of $1 5 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ (the variation trend of BC1 was consistent with the analysis results,for conciseness,the contour map was omitted). In the horizontal direction, the water distribution was manifest as the soil water content initially increasing and then decreasing with increased distance from the point source. The maximum water content of each treatment was at $7 \mathrm { c m }$ from the point source (Figs. 8 and 9).At the same distance from the point source,the larger was the biochar addition rate, the higher was the water content and this phenomenon was most obvious in the region with high water content at soil depth around $7 0 \mathrm { m m }$ (Fig. 9).

To understand the water distribution in the vertical direction,we selected the vertical section with an angle of $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ to the $x$ -axis (CZ-plane) for typical analysis.Figure 10 shows the contour maps of water distribution in the vertical section (the variation trend of BC1 was consistent with the analysis results， for conciseness, the contour maps was omited). The water distribution characteristics of each treatment in the vertical direction were that soil water content initially increased and then declined with depth. Comparing with BCO,the soil water distribution in the treated layer was relatively even (Fig. 11). The major reasons for this were the weak water-retaining capacity of sandy soil and strong vertical infiltration ability.As a result, the water was quickly distributed in all soil layers and the maximum mass water content was only $1 3 . 6 5 \mathrm { ~ \% ~ }$ in the whole wetted body.

After the biochar addition, the soil layer of $1 5 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ had the maximum water content for each treatment, followed by the layers of 5O-100 and $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ ,and 0-5 and $2 5 0 { \mathrm { - } } 4 0 0 { \mathrm { m m } }$ .The water distribution characteristics would help to retain most moisture in the layer of $0 { - } 2 5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ and effectively prevent leakage in deep layers.The biochar had a strong effect on the water distribution of layers within $0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ .At the same position, the larger was the rate of biochar addition, the higher is the water content. Compared to the layer without biochar, the biochar addition had a certain effect on the water content in the layer of $2 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ,but it had less influence below 250 mm. Further comparison of water content characteristics of each treatment for the layer 250-400 mm showed that, at the same position, BC4 had the lowest water content and BC6 had the highest. Thus,BC4 better retained water within $0 { - } 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ (i.e.,the plow layer) and restrained water infiltration. Consequently, the application of biochar at $4 \%$ is recommended.

# 4Discussion

Biochar agricultural use has been reported as a soil amendment at home and abroad, but the quantitative relationship between the biochar addition rate and the water holding capacity of desertified soil is stillunclear.The water holding capacity of biochar itself is strong (the test biochar was produced from cotton straw with a water holding capacity of $1 7 3 \%$ ).Biochar addition can significantly improve the water holding capacity of sandy soil and increase the soil available water (increased by $6 . 2 7 \%$ under BC6 treatment compared with BCO). These results are consistent with those of Blanco-Canqui and Ibrahim (Ibrahim et al.,2013; Blanco-Canqui, 2017). In comparison, biochar treatment had a greater impact on saturated moisture content, with BC4 and BC6 increased by $2 9 . 9 7 \%$ and $3 5 . 6 6 \%$ ,respectively, which agreed with the findings of Wang (2013). The increase in saturated moisture content means that under the same environment, the application of biochar can better maintain a certain amount of water and the soil water holding capacity can be efectively improved.Therefore,as a soil conditioner, biochar can not only increase the water holding capacity of sandy soil, but also realize the resource utilization of agricultural straw waste. It has prospects of wide application (Liu et al., 2018).

Biochar can change the distribution and quantity of soil pore structure, which in turn affects soil water infiltration.The effect of biochar on soil water infiltration characteristics depends on the soil texture type. Qi et al. (2O15) believed that biochar can reduce the water infiltration capacity of sandy soil,which was not completely consistent with the results of this experiment. Biochar addition can restrain the lateral water migration in sandy soil (Wang et al.,2O18). In the vertical direction,the water infiltration rate initially declined and then increased with the increased biochar application. The main cause was that a moderate amount of biochar can fill macropores between sand grains and block part of the original soil drainage,thereby reducing vertical infiltration. When the biochar addition was high, the biochar particles could form new and clear drain channels,and therefore promote vertical infiltration.

The water movement characteristics under drip irrigation is the theoretical basis for drip irrigation engineering design. After biochar addition， the relatively uniform distribution characteristics of water of wetted bodies in the original sandy soil were changed. Most water could be retained in the plow layer,and water leakage in the deep layer was restrained, particularly for the biochar addition of $4 \%$ . However, when the biochar addition rate was large (e.g., $6 \%$ ），this contributed to water vertical infiltration and cause water leakage in the deep layer. It is necessary to further study the effects on water vertical infiltration in sandy or coarse soils,using high biochar addition rate (e.g., $6 \% - 1 0 \%$ (w/w)). The effects of biochar addition on water movements under drip irrigation were clear and this will be beneficial to improve the water regime in sandy soil using drip irrigation and enhance water use efficiency (Kangoma et al., 2O17) and drought resistance of crops.

# 5 Conclusions

In sand soil, biocarbon addition can significantly increase soil water holding capacity and soil available water, which will facilitate crop growth. Within the same infiltration time,with the increased rate of biochar addition, the diffusion distance of HWF tended to reduce,but VWF initially declined and then increased.A certain biochar added proportion was beneficial to slow the infiltration rate in the vertical direction, but excessive addition improved vertical infiltration. At the same distance from the point source, the larger was the biochar addition rate,the higher was the soil water content.The biochar had large effects on the layer within $0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ .A biochar application amount of $4 \%$ is recommended for improvement of sandy soil. It is recommended that the test soil biochar application is $4 \%$ ， so that more irrigation water can be maintained at O-250 mm (the tillage layer) to reduce deep leakage.

The indoor experimental comparisons showed effects of biochar addition on water movement under drip irrigation in sandy soil. This provides a theoretical basis for further researches on the water migration mechanism in the "biochar-drip irigation-sandy soil-crop" system. However, the water movement characteristics are greatly aected by environmental or biological factors,such as macropores formed by earthworms and ants. In the screening process, particles larger than 2.000 mm were removed from the tested soil, which greatly decreased the number of macropores. The compaction process also seriously changes the natural soil structure. Therefore, there may be some differences between the test results and the practical situation.Further field trials are required to assess such potential problems to determine the potential productivity of biochar addition in sandy or coarse soil.
