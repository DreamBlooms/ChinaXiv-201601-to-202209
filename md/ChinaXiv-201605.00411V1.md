# The wheat MYB-related transcription factor TaMYB72 promotes flowering in rice

SummaryThrough large-scale transformation analyses,TaMYB72 was identified as a flowering time regulator in wheat. TaMYB72 is a MYB family transcription factor localized to the nucleus. Three TaMYB72 homologs, TaMYB72-A， TaMYB72-B and TaMYB72-D， cloned from hexaploid wheat were mapped to the short arm of the group 6 chromosomes. Under the long-day conditions, over-expression of the TaMYB72 in rice shortened the flowering time by approximately 12 d. Expression analyses suggest that TaMYB72 may function through upregulation of florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1.

Flowering time in plants isan important trait that determines distribution and regional adaptability,which ultimatelyaffect the seed production of plants (Andres and Coupland 2012).A better understanding of the genetic pathways that control the flowering time of plants may provide effective strategies for engineering high-yield varieties thatadapt to differentclimate conditions and changing environments (Jung and Muller 2009).

Our previous works generated more than 15,000 transgenic rice plants with overexpression of wheat transcription factor genes.One transgenic line，4L-11-1，which exhibited an earlier flowering phenotype,was identified from the To transgenic plants.Compared with wild-type (WT) plants,4L-11-1 showed a flowering time shortened by 12.1 d (Figure S1A). Sequence analysis confirmed that the 4L-11-1 transgenic lines contained a transformed wheat gene, TaMYB72.Further evaluation of the segregation of TaMYB72 in T1 plants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR） using primers specific for TaMYB72 indicated that TaMYB72 cosegregated with the phenotype of earlier flowering (Figure S1B; Table S1).

Three TaMYB72 homologs，TaMYB72-A，TaMYB72-B and TaMYB72-D，containing six exons and five introns，were cloned from hexaploid wheat (Figure S2A,B).Through Basic Local Alignment Search Tool(BLAST) analysis ofthe ordered draft sequence of the hexaploid bread wheat genome that was produced by sequencing isolated chromosomearms(InternationalWheatGenome Sequencing 2014)， the TaMYB72-A，TaMYB72-B and TaMYB72-D genes were assigned to wheat chromosomes 6AS，6BS and 6DS， respectively (Figure S2C). Using TaMYB72s as the query sequences，13 homologous MYB protein sequences with unknown function were identified in dicots and monocots.Phylogenetic analysis of TaMYB72s and their homologs was used to generate a phylogenetic tree that contained two main clades.Two barley proteins，BAKo26o1.1 and J88577.1， shared the closest relationship with the TaMYB72 proteins,and the sequence identities between these proteins ranged from $9 4 . 9 \%$ to $9 7 . 0 \%$ .Other proteins exhibited $5 6 . 7 \%$ to $8 3 . 3 \%$ sequence identity with the TaMYB72 proteins (Figure S3). Transient co-expression of the TaMYB72-GFP and nuclear marker OsMADS3-mCherry constructs in rice leaf protoplasts indicated that the TaMYB72 protein is a nuclear protein (Figure S4).

Additional TaMYB72 transgenic lines driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter (pUbi:TaMYB72) and the native promoter (pTaMYB72::TaMYB72) were produced in the Nipponbare background. Similar to 4L-11-1， flowering of the newly transformed pUbi:TaMYB72 transgenic plantswasaccelerated by 12.1d compared to wild type (WT) plants under natural long day conditions in Beijing,but not under natural short day conditions in Hainan.pUbi::TaMYB72 transgenic plants also exhibited accelerated flowering under controlled long day conditions (15 h light/9 h dark) but not under controlled short day conditions (9h light/15h dark)(Figure 1，S5). Similarly, pTaMYB72:TaMYB72 transgenic plants exhibited flowering approximately 11.9d earlier than WT under long day conditions but no change in flowering time under short day conditions (Figure S6).These results demonstrated that TaMYB72 may promote flowering specifically under long day conditions.

To determine whetherTaMYB72also regulates other traits in rice,we investigated the phenotypic data for transgenic rice planted in Beijing and Langfang. Compared with WT，the TaMYB72 transgenic rice lines exhibited reductions in plant height，panicle length，grain numbers and primary branch numbers,while no obvious differences were observed in tillernumber or 1ooo-grain weight between TaMYB72 transgenic rice and WT (Table S2).These results indicate that TaMYB72 may be an important regulator with multiple functions in rice.

To decipher the possible mechanism of TaMYB72 in regulating rice flowering，we compared the expression of several photoperiod-related genes in WT and transgenic plants under long day conditions using quantitative reverse transcription PCR.Hd3a and RFT1, the two florigen genes,play majorroles in the photoperiodic induction ofthe floral transition in rice (Tamaki et al. 2oo7; Komiya et al. 2008; Itoh et al.2o1o).The expression level of Hd3a increased dramatically during light time in TaMYB72 transgenic plants, while the expression of RFT1 increased at all the time points during the examined 24 h period (Figure 2).Subsequently, the expression of their downstream gene，OsMADS14，was induced strongly in the TaMYB72 transgenic plants.Hd1 and Ehd1 are two regulators of the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 (Yano et al.2ooo; Doi etal.2oo4).To determine whether the activation of florigen genes by TaMYB72 is mediated by Hd1 and/or Ehd1,we compared their expression levelsin WT and TaMYB72 transgenic plants.The expression of Ehd1 was induced in the TaMYB72 transgenic plants,while the expression of Hd1 was not changed in the TaMYB72 transgenic plants, (A)Phenotypes of transgenic rice planted under NLD conditions.

indicating that TaMYB72 plays a role in regulating the flowering mediated by Ehd1.We then tested whether TaMYB72 influences the expression of other known regulators of Ehd1, including two positive regulators OsMADS5o and $\boldsymbol { O s } \boldsymbol { G } \boldsymbol { I }$ ，and four negative regulators Se5,Ghd7,Ghd7.1 and Ghd8 (Park et al. 1999; Xue et al. 20o8; Andres et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2011; Yan et al. 2o13). Unexpectedly， the transcription levels of these genes were not significantly affected in the TaMYB72 transgenic plants.These observations suggest that TaMYB72 functions upstream of Ehd1 but independent of the Ehd1 regulators we examined.Together，these observations suggest that TaMYB72 may regulate the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 mediated by Ehd1，ultimately promoting rice flowering under long day conditions (Figure 2).

In this study， the function of the wheat TaMYB72 gene was characterized by examining its heterologous expression in rice.These results provide important cues for thoroughly understanding the function and mechanisms of TaMYB72.
