# Abstract

Miscanthus,a perennial grass with $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ photosynthesis, is regarded as a promising energy crop due to its high biomass productivity. Compared with other $\mathrm { C _ { 4 } }$ species, most miscanthus genotypes have high cold tolerances at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，However,in temperate climates,temperatures below $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ are common and our aim was to elucidate cold tolerances of different miscanthus genotypes and compare with a ${ C } _ { 3 }$ perennial grass - festulolium. Eleven genotypes of M. sacchariflorus,M. sinensis,M. tinctorius,M. $\times$ giganteus as well as festulolium were grown under warm $( 2 4 / 2 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ day/night) and three under cold ( $1 4 / 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ （ $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ and $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ conditions in a controlled environment. Measurements of photosynthetic light response curves,operating quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII), net photosynthetic rate at a PAR of $1 0 \mathrm { \bar { 0 } 0 } \mathrm { \ } \mathrm { \mu m o } \mathrm { \bar { l } \ m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { \ s } ^ { - 1 }$ （204号 $( A _ { 1 0 0 0 } )$ and dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence $\mathrm { ( F v / F m ) }$ were made at each temperature. In addition, temperature response curves were measured after the plants had been grown at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .The results showed that two tetraploid $M$ .sacchariflorus and the standard triploid $M . \times$ giganteus $c v$ .Hornum retained a significantly higher photosynthetic capacity than other miscanthus genotypes at each temperature level and still maintained photosynthesis after growing for a longer period at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Only two of five measured miscanthus genotypes increased photosynthesis immediately after the temperature was raised again. The photosynthetic capacity of festulolium was significantly higher at $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ than of miscanthus genotypes.This indicates that festulolium may be more productive than the currently investigated miscanthus genotypes in cool, maritime climates.Within miscanthus,only one $M$ ，sacchariflorus genotype exhibited the same photosynthetic capacity as Hornum at both cold conditions and when the temperature was raised again. Therefore,this genotype could be useful for breeding new varieties with an improved cold tolerance vis-a-vis Hornum,and be valuable in broadening the genetic diversity of miscanthus for more widespread cultivation in temperate climates.

# Introduction

Bioenergy crops are a potential replacement source for fossil fuels. To make this option economically competitive and sustainable,major research issues include identifying crops that have a maximum biomass production and at the same time a minimum environmental impact when grown on marginal land under various abiotic stress conditions (Gabrielle et al.，2014). Even though the yield of crops depends on light interception,conversion and partitioning efficiencies,an extension of the growing season has a significant positive impact on biomassproduction (Zhu et al.，2010). To provide sustainable biomasses/feedstocks in temperate climates, the ideal bioenergy crop should be perennial and have a high cold-tolerance to support a long growing season in which photosynthesis can take place, thereby promoting high annual yields and low losses to the environment (Karp & Shield,2008).

An important basic physiological trait influencing cold sensitivity and productivity in crops is the difference between ${ \bf C } _ { 3 }$ and $C _ { 4 }$ photosynthesis.Photosynthetic activity in ${ C } _ { 3 }$ and $C _ { 4 }$ species differs under cold conditions. For ${ \bf C } _ { 3 }$ plants，the Rubisco capacity has been regarded as the predominant constraint to photosynthesis under a wide range of temperatures at $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ levels below the current ambient concentration (Farquhar et al.,1980; Sage & Kubien, 2007). The $C _ { 4 }$ photosynthesis is usually advantageous at low $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentrations and high temperatures,and thus its distribution is usually limited at daily mean minimum temperatures of 8 to $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or below during the period of active growth (Teeri & Stowe,1976; Long,1983).However,it has been found that the $C _ { 4 }$ Miscanthus $\times$ giganteus is capable of reaching high photosynthetic efficiency even in October with an average temperature of $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in southern England (Beale et al.,1996),and it ishypothesized that the $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ sensitivity to low temperatures may not be a generic and unbreakable trait (Long & Spence,2013).

The perennial grass crop，miscanthus,has therefore been regarded as one of the most ideal energy crops due to its high biomass potential and low fertilizer requirements (Lewandowski et al.,2ooO) and because it can be harvested yearly with high average yields ranging from 13.1 to $1 4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { M g ~ h a } ^ { - 1 }$ for a period of more than 15 years even in the cold temperate maritime climate of Denmark (Larsen et al.,2014).Another productive perennial grass under temperate conditions,but with the ${ \bf C } _ { 3 }$ photosynthetic pathway，is festulolium，which has been found useful for extending the autumn grazing season in continental conditions (Skladanka et al., 201o).Festulolium is a cross between species from the genus Festuca,with a high level of general stress tolerance towards e.g. drought and heavy grazing,and species from the genus Lolium,which is the predominant forage grass in Europe (Wilkins & Humphreys,2003). Several festulolium cultivars,in which the good forage quality of ryegrass species has been combined with the high persistency and stress tolerance of fescues，have been bred recently (Ostrem & Larsen,2008;Halling,2012).The cultivar festulolium $c v$ .Hykor has been shown to have a high yield potential of around $1 8 ~ \mathrm { M g ~ h a } ^ { - 1 }$ and high persistency throughout the season (www.DLF.com).Thus，festulolium may be ideal as a sustainable feedstock for biorefineries (e.g.protein feed and bioenergy） in temperate climates (Parajuli etal.,2015).

In previous studies, $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ has been chosen as an important temperature level for examining the cold tolerance of plants with $C _ { 4 }$ photosynthesis (Haldimann, 1996;Farage et al.,2006).We screened a range of miscanthus genotypes for their tolerance toa $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ growing environment to find improved genotypes compared with M. $\times$ giganteus,but found only a few with slightly improved characteristics (Jiao et al.,2016).However,plants in northern Europe are frequently exposed to much lower temperatures,especially in the autumn and spring seasons. Therefore screening of the photosynthetic response to temperatures below $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ may be helpful to identify genotypes with a high tolerance to low temperatures,which are critical for growth in the spring and autumn in continental climates and throughout the growing season in cool temperate maritime climates.

In a side-by-side trial in Illinois,Dohleman & Long (2009) found that M. $\times$ giganteus was $5 9 \%$ more productive than maize (Zea mays) due to its larger leaf area and its longer growing season that was facilitated by superior cold tolerance.Photosynthesis in M. $\times$ giganteus has been found to still occur at $1 0 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } } ,$ although at a lower rate than in plants grown at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Farage et al., 2006). Photosynthetic $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ uptake of $M . \times$ giganteus and maize measured during short-term exposure to $5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ after having been grown at $2 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ showed that $M$ $\times$ giganteus kept a photosynthetic level of around 4 to $5 \ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } \ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { - 2 } \ { \mathrm { s } } ^ { - 1 } ,$ which was significantlyhigher thanthe 1 to $2 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ of maize grown at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Naidu et al.,20o3).However,it is unclear whether the photosynthetic apparatus in the miscanthus was damaged or not and whether the photosynthetic capacity would continue to function after long-term exposure to temperatures below $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The $C _ { 3 }$ photosynthesis of festulolium is expected to be tolerant to low temperatures, but an exposure to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ resulted in a dramatic decline in maximum quantum yield of PSI $\mathrm { ( F v / F m ) }$ ，in increased nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and in reduced efficiency of energy conversion in the photochemical processes (qP) (Pociecha et al.,2010).

Previous studies on high-yielding and cold-tolerant miscanthus have focused mainly on M. $\times$ giganteus cv. Hornum (Larsen et al.,2014),although this genotype is impossible to further improve by breeding since it is a steriletriploidhybridofa tetraploidM.sacchariflorus anddiploidM.sinensis(Greef&Deuter,1993) withlittle genetic diversity (Hodkinson et al.，20o2；Clark et al., 2014).However，M sinensis and M.sacchariflous could be used to breed new M. $\times$ giganteus cultivars for broadening the genetic base which would be useful in the breeding of high-yielding genotypes with improved cold-tolerance or for growing on a wider scale (CliftonBrown & Lewandowski,2002;Jorgensen，2011).Other miscanthus species may also contribute cold tolerance to breeding，one possibility being M.tinctorius，which often grows at high altitudes or latitudes.

Exploring the background for high cold-tolerance in plants with $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ photosynthesis may be helpful before introducing them in cool regions and broadening their planting area.An earlier study has found that low-temperature photoinhibition associated with the xanthophyll cycle (zeaxanthin accumulated from violaxanthin under high light conditions)is reversible and is a strategy for $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ species to tolerate cool climates,even though it was more detrimental to carbon gain in the $C _ { 4 }$ grass Muhlenbergia glomerata than in the ${ C } _ { 3 }$ species Calamogrostis canadensis grown at $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Kubien $\&$ Sage, 2004a).Photo damage is characterized by a reduced photosynthetic capacity，which cannot be redeemed by a rising temperature.For example,low temperatures affect both the light-harvesting apparatus and the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ -fixing enzymes ofmaize (Baker et al.,1983).A previous study has reported that the ability to sustain the photosynthetic rate at a relatively high level at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in some genotypes might be dependent on maintenance and increase of Rubisco (Spence,2012) and PPDK concentrations in leaves (Wang et al.,2o08a,b).

${ C } _ { 3 }$ plants usually have a lower optimal temperature and lower maximum photosynthetic rates,but have the advantage of higher photosynthesis at low temperatures than $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants (Pearcy et al.,1981;Yamori et al.,2014). Still, it is unclear at which temperature level miscanthus can compete with $C _ { 3 }$ species in cool climates,and to what degree there is genetic variation within the genus that may help improve the competitiveness of miscanthus.Increased knowledge of this will also be helpful for guiding site selection and adapting the cultivation practices for these two types of crop in cool climates.

Theaim of this work was toexamine the cold tolerance of different $C _ { 4 }$ miscanthus genotypes through studies of net photosynthetic rate $( A _ { \mathrm { n } } )$ ，PSII operating efficiency (ΦPSII)，maximum quantum yield $( F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } } )$

and light response under various growth temperatures down to $6 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ，Furthermore,the cold tolerance of $\mathrm { C _ { 4 } }$ miscanthuswascompared with onewell-known, highly-productive festulolium cultivar. Our hypothesis was that we would be able to identify genotypes with a higher photosynthetic performance under cold conditions than the M. $\times$ giganteus co.Hornum and that these genotypes may even compete with a ${ C } _ { 3 }$ grass under the variable,temperate,maritime conditions of northwestern Europe.

TPloidy levels were determined by flow cytometry described in Jiao et al. (2016).

The miscanthus genotypes Tin-1, Sin-3, Sac-10, Sac-11, Sac12, Gig-13 and Gig-14 were selected for this study because they showed the most interesting results for growth under cold conditions in a previous climate chamber experiment (Jiao et al., 2016).These were supplemented with two genotypes selected from the 166 genotypes that were previously evaluated in field experiments by Jiao et al.(2016):Sin-15 was selected because it had a late blossom and senescence in the autumn,and Sac-16 was chosen because it had a high photosynthetic rate in field experiments (data not shown).Two final M.sacchariflorus genotypes (Sac-17 and Sac-18) were selected from 222 accessions collected during a 2012 joint USDA-Vavilov Institute expeditionin Eastern RussialedbyErikJ.Sacks (LV.Clark,D.Elena, D.Nikolay et al, unpublished data).They grew at high latitude (Table1) and had tall and relatively thick stems compared with the other collected genotypes (Erik Sacks,personal communication).In contrast with Japanese M.sacchariflorus,which is tetraploid,these Russian M.sacchariflorus are diploid.The Russian genotypes were planted in pots in the greenhouse in Denmark between 8 and16 October 2012.

# Plantcultiuation

All miscanthus rhizomes,except Sac-17 and Sac-18,were dug up from the field on 15 November 2013 before onset of frost. They were stored at $2 ^ { \circ } C$ until five days before planting and then at approx. $1 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for acclimatization until planting out. The rhizomes were planted on 18 February 2014 in pots measuring $2 5 \times 1 5 \times 3 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ (length,width,height) and each filled with $2 . 2 ~ \mathrm { k g }$ peat (Pindstrup Substrate no. 4, $1 0 { - } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ 5 $\mathrm { \ p H \ 6 . 0 } ,$ containing NPK fertilizer $1 . 0 \mathrm { ~ g ~ l ~ } ^ { - 1 }$ and micro fertilizer $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ $1 ^ { - 1 } \ d ,$ .The rhizomes were planted in six replicates of each genotype.The Russian Sac-17 and Sac-18 were planted on 25 February using rhizomes from the plants grown in the greenhouse. Whole plants of Hykor were dug up from a field experiment established in 2012 (Manevski et al.,2015) on7November 2013. Theywere irrigated immediately and kept outside the greenhouse during the winter next to the wall to protect them from severe frost. They were moved to the greenhouse and cut down to $6 { - } 8 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ height on 12 March 2014.All plants were cultivated in the greenhouse for 7 weeks.The temperature in the greenhouse was kept at approx. $1 5 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ day/night $( \mathrm { d } / \mathrm { n } )$ .Artificial light was turned on between O6:0o and 18:0o if the solar radiation during that time was below $6 7 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ The intensityofteartiicallghtabot $3 5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { - 2 } ~ { \mathrm { s } } ^ { - 1 }$ provided by $4 0 0 ~ W$ metal-halide lamps (Osram Powerstar HQI-BT Daylight).

# Irrigationand fertilization

The plants in the greenhouse were irrigated every two or three days to field capacity.After one month's growth in the greenhouse, $1 \%$ inorganic fertilizer (Prima Vaeksthusgodning,NPK 3-1-4)was added to the irrigation water every second or third day (in 0.31 water to each pot).During the period of measurements in the climate chamber all the plants were irrigated every eveningand fertilizer was added every second or third day.

# Gas exchange measurements

$\mathrm { O n } \ 1 5 \ \mathrm { A p r i l } ,$ all plants except Sac-18 were moved from the greenhouse into two climate chambers with same controlled environmental conditions. The genotype Sac-18 was moved from the greenhouse into the climate chamber on 5 May 2014 justafter the temperature had been decreased to $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Three replicates of each genotype were cultivated in each of the two chambers.The plants were randomly arranged on trolleys. They were grown in a constant temperature of 24/ $2 0 \ ^ { \circ } C \ \mathrm { d / n }$ for the warm conditions and $1 4 / 1 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ d / n ~ }$ under a PAR of $6 7 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ . The relative humidity for warm conditions was set to $8 5 / 8 5 \% \ \mathrm { d / n }$ and the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration was set to $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p p m }$ .After 12 days of growth in the warm conditions, light response curve measurements were performed (see details below） on four selected genotypes of miscanthus and festulolium,i.e. Tin-1, Sin-15,Sac-12,Gig-13 and Fest-19. The photosynthetic rate at a photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of $1 0 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \ ( A _ { 1 0 0 0 } )$ and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured on all the plants on 30 April as described below.

After 20 days in the warm conditions, the temperature in the chamber was reduced to $1 4 / 1 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \ \mathrm { d / n }$ with the same day/night cycle as for the warm conditions.The relative humidity was set to $7 5 / 8 5 \% \mathrm { ~ d / n } ,$ while all other conditions were set as described above for $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ Nine days later, the temperature in the chamber was reduced to $1 0 / 8 \ \mathrm { ^ circ C \ d / n }$ and the relative humidity was set to $8 5 \% / 9 0 \% \mathrm { d / n } ,$ while other conditions were left unchanged.After nine days at 10/ $8 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ the temperature in the chamber was reduced to $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $\mathrm { { d } / n }$ cycle and the relative humidity was set to $8 5 \% / 9 5 \%$ d/ n. Other conditions were left unchanged.After 5 days growth at each temperature level, light response curve measurements were performed on the five miscanthus and festulolium genotypes.In addition, $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ as well as chlorophyll fluorescence were measured on all the plants at the end of each cold temperature level.

Gas exchange measurements were performed on the youngest fully developed leaf (ligule present) of six replicates of each genotype from 8:30 to 15:00 hours using an open-flow gas exchange system,CIRAS-2 (PP Systems,Amesbury,MA,USA). The conditions inside the cuvette were set to reflect controlled environmental conditions (i.e.the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration was set to $4 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the mean leaf temperature was maintained at the same level as the growth temperature).The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the leaf cuvette was $1 . 0 \mathrm { ~ k P a }$ （204号 $( 2 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ $0 . 6 \mathrm { \ k P a }$ 1 $( 1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ and $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $0 . 5 \mathrm { \ k P a }$ $( 6 ~ ^ { \circ } C )$ and the airflow through the chamber was $2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m l \ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ ：PAR was set to $1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { \textmu m o l \ m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { { s } } ^ { - 1 }$ ：

For the light-response curve measurements,the leaves were acclimatized to a PAR of $1 5 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { - 2 } ~ { \mathrm { s } } ^ { - 1 }$ 0 ${ 2 4 } ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and $1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { \textmu m o l \ m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ $( 6 ~ ^ { \circ } C )$ until the photosynthetic ratewas stabilized (Wang et al.，2012).The PAR was then decreased from 1500 to $2 0 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l \ m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ in twelve steps (1500, 1200,1000,800,500,300,200,150,100,80,50 and 20).For $6 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ there were only 10 steps as the steps at 1500 and $1 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l }$ $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ were skipped. The measurements were logged after the photosynthetic rates had stabilized,which was usually after two minutes.

# Temperature response curves

The temperature response of photosynthesis was measured afterseven days of growth at $6 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ in the climate chamber. The temperature in the leaf cuvette was set at five steps: $5 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } , 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } , 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C .$ It was measured on three to four replicates on the youngest fully developed leaf with each leaf measured at all temperatures,and the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration was controlled at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p p m }$ . For each temperature measurement, leaves were light and temperature-acclimated until steady state had been achieved in the gas exchange cuvette at a PAR of $1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l \ m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { \ s } ^ { - 1 }$ .Attempts were made to keep a similar leafto-air vapor pressure deficit at all temperatures by modifying therelative humidity in the leaf cuvette.Still,an increase in VPD could not be avoided with increasing temperatures.

# Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements

Chlorophyll fluorescence was determined on Day 6 of each temperature settlement under the cold conditions using a MiniPAM fluorometer (Walz,Germany).The leaves were darkadaptedwithDarkLeafClips for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ before the measurements were performed (Bolhar-Nordenkampf et al.,1989).The minimal fluorescence $( F _ { 0 } )$ was determined at very low PPFD, where the PSII reaction centers are in the ‘open'state.The maximal fluorescence $( F _ { \mathrm { m } } )$ was measured by applying a $0 . 8 \mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ pulse at a high light level of approx. $4 0 0 0 \ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } ,$ which forces the closure of the reaction centers (Krause & Somersalo,1989). The maximum quantum yield of PSII $( F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } } )$ was calculated from $F _ { 0 }$ and $F _ { \mathrm { m } } ,$ as $F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } } = ( F _ { \mathrm { m } } { - } F _ { 0 } ) / F _ { \mathrm { m } }$ .All measurements were repeated on the six replicates of each genotype.

When an actinic light is applied on the leaf,maximum fluorescence in the light $( { F _ { \mathrm { m } } } ^ { \prime } )$ can be measured with a saturating flash,and steady-state fluorescence $( F _ { \mathrm { s } } )$ can also be recorded just prior to the flash.The operating quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦPSII)，calculated as $( F _ { \mathrm { m } } { } ^ { \prime } { - } F _ { \mathrm { s } } ) / F _ { \mathrm { m } } { } ^ { \prime }$ (Genty et al., 1989)was measured immediatelyafter the $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ had reached steady state using the chlorophyll fluorescence module (CFM) in CIRAS-2 on the ninth day after the growth temperature was decreased.It was always measured between 8:30 and 15:00.

The instantaneous quantum cost of assimilation can be approximated by the ratio of ΦPSII to quantum yield of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assimilation $( \Phi { \bf C } { \bf O } _ { 2 } )$ (Oberhuber & Edwards,1993).The $\Phi { \bf C } { \bf O } _ { 2 }$ parameter is the efficiency of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assimilation,which is calculated as $A$ / $\operatorname { \mathrm { ' } } ( \operatorname { P A R } ^ { * } { \mathfrak { a } } )$ . Leaf absorptance $( { \boldsymbol { \mathsf { x } } } )$ was assumed to be 0.85 for all the genotypes in this study for the four temperature treatments, since generally $8 5 \%$ of incident light can be absorbedbyleaves(Singsaaset al.， 20o1） andalso because apparently no dramatic changes in leaf absorptance (approximately 0.85) take place between 450 and $7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ for $M$ $\times$ giganteus grownat10,14 and $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ (Farage et al.,2006).

The AQY values were obtained from linear regression of the relationship between net $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assimilation and PAR across five points at incident light intensities from 20 to $1 5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { - 2 } ~ { \mathrm { s } } ^ { - 1 }$ (Long et al.,1996). $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 5 0 0 }$ was the rate of photosynthesis at a PAR of $1 5 0 0 \ \mu { \mathrm { m o l } } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \ ( A _ { 1 5 0 0 } )$

# Statisticalanalysis

Data for each temperature treatment were analysed separately usingAnalysis ofVariance.Ifa significant effectwasobserved, multiple comparisons were performed using Tukey's HSD test. The difference in ΦPSII/ $\Phi { \bf C } { \bf O } _ { 2 }$ ratio between temperature treatments for each genotype was analysed using the same methods asmentioned above.All the analyses and tests were done in R version 3.1.2(Team RC,2015).TheR package lsmeans'(Lenth & Hervé,20o5) was used for multiple comparisons.

# Results

Photosynthetic performance and operating quantum yield of PSII

The ${ A _ { 1 0 0 0 } }$ of Sac-12 grown at $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was $2 5 . 7 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l }$ $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } .$ , which was significantly higher than other genotypes except Sac-16, Sac-11 and Gig-13 (Fig. 1a). The lowest values of 18.0 and $9 . 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ were measured in Sin-15 and Tin-1,respectively,and this was significantly lower than for Sac-11,Sac-12,Gig-13,Sac-16 and Fest-19.Concerning ΦPSII,Fest-19 and Sac-12 had significantlyhighervalues(0.379 and 0.366,respectively) than Sac-10, Sin-15, Gig-14 and Tin-1 (Fig. 1b).

For all genotypes, $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ was reduced when the temperature was decreased，albeit to different extents (Fig. 1a).At the $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ temperature,Fest-19 showed the highest $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ at $1 5 . 2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ .This ${ \bf C } _ { 3 }$ species as well as Sac-12 and Sac-11 had significantly higher $ { \boldsymbol { A } } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ values than M. tinctorius, the two $M$ sinensis geno types， Sac-17 (the Russian genotype) and Sac-16 (Fig.1a).Fest-19 also had the highest @PSI at $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Sin-3 and Gig-14 had significantly lower @PSII values than Sac-11, Sac-12, Gig-13 and Fest-19.

When the temperature was reduced to $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ Fest-19 showed significantly higher $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ ? $\cdot 1 4 . 3 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l }$ $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } )$ values than all the miscanthus genotypes of which Sac-11，Sac-12 and Gig-13 had significantly higher values (9.8, 8.0 and $8 . 9 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { - 2 } ~ { \mathrm { s } } ^ { - 1 } ,$ respectively） than all the other miscanthusgenotypes (Fig.la).A similar trend was observed at the $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ conditions，where $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ in Fest-19 was $7 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ $\mathbf { s } ^ { - 1 }$ but 3.8 and $3 . 2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ in Sac-11 and Gig13,respectively，which is significantly higher than for the other miscanthus genotypes except for Sac-12 and Sin-15.The highest $\Phi$ PSII value was observed in Fest19 at both $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig.1b).Within the

miscanthusgenotypes， Sac-11， Sac-12 and Gig-13 showed significantly higher ΦPSlI values (O.191,0.157 and 0.195,respectively） than other genotypes at 10/ $8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ，There was no significant difference in $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I }$ values between the miscanthus genotypes at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig.1b).

# The $\phi P S I I / \phi C O _ { 2 }$ ratio

The ratio $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ increased after temperature reduction for the miscanthus genotypes.However, there was no significant change in Fest-19 when the temperature was decreased to $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ and even

$6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio for Tin-1 and Fest-19 was significantly higher than for the other miscanthus genotypes at $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 1c).At $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ Sac-12, Sac-11 and Gig-13 had the lowest values compared to the other genotypes, but they were not significantly different from other genotypes except Tin-1. When the temperature decreased from $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ a significant increase was found in Sac-11,Sac-12, Gig-13, Gig-14 and Sac-17. At $1 0 / 8 { \ } ^ { \circ } C ,$ Sin-3, Gig-13, Sac-1land Sac-12 had significantly lower values than all other genotypes except Sin-15 and Sac-17(Fig.1c). The $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio in Sin-3, Sac-11 and Sin-15 increased significantly from $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ to $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ whereas for Sac-18 it decreased (not significantly).At $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ the ratio was significantly higher in Sin-3,Tin-1 and Sac-16 than in Sac-12, Gig-13, Sac-18 and Fest-19.

# Chlorophyll fluorescence

The ${ \bf C } _ { 3 }$ crop Fest-19 had an ${ F _ { \mathrm { v } } } / { F _ { \mathrm { m } } }$ value of 0.82 when it was grown at $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ while in the miscanthus genotypes valueswere between 0.73 and 0.80 (Fig.2).Three genotypes,Sac-10, Sac-11 and Sac-16,had significantly higher $F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } }$ values of 0.80,0.79,and 0.80,respectively, than the 0.74 and 0.73,respectively,of Gig-14 and Tin-1 at $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ：

A reduction in $F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } }$ was observed in all miscanthus genotypes during the temperature decrease，but was less clear for Fest-19 (Fig.2). Tin-1 and Gig-14 had significantly lower values than other genotypes at 14/ $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，When the temperature was further decreased to $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ there was a slight decrease in Fest-19,but it was much greater in miscanthus.The $F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } }$ values of 0.68,0.65 and 0.67,respectively,for Gig-13, Sac-11 and Sac-12 were significantly higher than the 0.43, 0.44, 0.51, 0.48 and O.51 for Sin-3, Tin-1, Sac-16, Gig-14 and Sac-18.

At $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ the $F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } }$ value in Fest-19 $F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } }$ was 0.71. This was significantly higher than all the miscanthus genotypes.At this temperature there was no significant difference between Gig-13,Sac-11，Sac-12 and Sin-15, but they had significantly higher values than Sin-3, Sac10,Sac-16 and Gig-14 (Fig. 2). For both Fest-19 and the miscanthusgenotypes， the largest reductionwas observed when the temperature dropped from $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ：

# Light response curves at different temperature levels

The responses of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assimilation to light showed sig nificant effects of temperature on genotypes at each measured lightlevel (Fig. 3). Sac-12 and Fest-19 showed significantly higher AQY (0.043 and O.041） than other measured genotypes at $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 4).A significant reduction of AQY was observed in the measured genotypeswhen the temperature was decreased from 24/ $2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ to $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 、However， there was no significant reduction of AQY for Sac-11, Sac-12, Gig-13 and Fest-19 when the temperature was further decreased from 14/ $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ while Tin-1 and Sin-15 had a decrease of $3 8 \%$ and $5 2 \%$ ,respectively.No significantdifference in AQY was observed between Sac-11,Sac-12,Gig-13 and Fest-19 grown at $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 0 / 8 { \ } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } } .$ At $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ Fest-19 maintained the same AQYlevel as when it was grown under $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ while the miscanthus genotypes

experienced a significant reduction when the temperaturefell from $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Sac-12 had the highest $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 5 0 0 }$ value of $3 0 . 6 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ $\mathbf { s } ^ { - 1 }$ at $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 4b). This was significantly higher than for Fest-19 $( 2 5 . 1 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l \ m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { \ s } ^ { - 1 } )$ and the other genotypes,except Gig-13 $( 2 7 . 9 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } )$ .However,Fest19 maintained the highest $A _ { 1 5 0 0 }$ compared to the miscanthus genotypes at the three cold temperatures. Of the miscanthus genotypes at $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ Sac-11hada significantly higher $A _ { 1 5 0 0 }$ 0 $1 4 . 8 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l \ m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } )$ than Sin-15 and Tin-1 (11.1 and $6 . 1 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } ,$ respectively).When the temperature was reduced to $1 0 / 8 { \ } ^ { \circ } C ,$ Sac-11 as well as Sac-12 and Gig-13 had significantly higher $A _ { 1 5 0 0 }$ values than Sin-15 and Tin-1.Furthermore,Sac-11 was significantly higher than Sin-15 and Tin-1 at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

# Short-term temperature response curves at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ growing temperature

Gig-13 and Sac-11 showed a significant increase in $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ when the temperature was increased from $5 ^ { \circ } C$ to $2 5 \ ^ { \circ } C ,$ while Sac-12 only increased when the temperature rose from $5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ to $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and remained steady during further temperature increases (Fig. 5).However, the $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ ofFest-19,which showed the highest level at $5 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ decreased significantly when the temperature was increased to $1 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ as the leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit increased during the temperature increase $\mathrm { ( f r o m ~ 0 . 4 ~ }$ to $2 . 5 \mathrm { ~ k P a } )$ , inducing stomatal closure (Fig. S1,A).

# Discussion

# Photosynthetic performance at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } C$

The constraint to $\mathrm { C _ { 4 } }$ photosynthesis in miscanthus in cold conditions might differ depending on the temperature.We observed a decrease in $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ and ΦPSII in all the miscanthus genotypes and in festulolium for each temperature reduction.However，M. $\times$ giganteus has reportedly markedly higher photosynthetic ratesat $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ compared to other $C _ { 4 }$ species like maize (Naidu & Long,2004;Wang et al.,2008b) and Cyperus longus L. (Farage et al.,2006). In the present study, Sac-11, Sac-12 and Gig-13 maintained similar photosynthetic rates to the ${ { C } _ { 3 } }$ grass Fest-19 at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig.la). This indicates that some genotypes of miscanthus might be useful for cultivation in maritime temperate conditions. Our previous study suggests that a reduced photosynthetic activity in miscanthus due to a temperature decrease to $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ could be reversed in these cold-tolerant genotypes once the temperature is increased again (Jiao et al., 2016).Another study shows that the effect of a low growth temperature $( 1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ on photosynthesis in the $\mathrm { C _ { 4 } }$ grass M. glomerata could be reversed by a $2 4 \mathrm { - h }$ exposure to higher temperatures (Kubien & Sage，2Oo4a).This suggests that such a reversible photoinhibition at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is lacking in maize (Naidu et al., 2003),but is a strategy for some $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ species to tolerate cool climates (Kubien & Sage,2004a).

Generally, $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants show their photosynthetic advantage over ${ \bf C } _ { 3 }$ plants at temperatures above $2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ (Yamori et al.,2014).However,here we find that some miscanthus genotypes can compete with ${ C } _ { 3 }$ festulolium atatemperature of $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

For $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants there is linear relationship between ΦPSII and $\Phi { \bf C } { \bf O } _ { 2 }$ under nonstressed conditions over a range of light intensities (Genty et al.，1989;Krall & Edwards,199O).No significant increase in $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ was found for any of the genotypes in this study when the temperaturewas lowered from $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ t $) 1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig.1c).This is consistent with previous findings that no significant changes happen to the $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio in M. $\times$ giganteus or Z. mays leaves when the temperature fallsfrom $2 5 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 4 / 1 1 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Naidu& Long，2Oo4). This indicates that the electron transport through PSII is just sufficient for the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assimilation requirement,and that no alternative electron sinks exist at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for any of the miscanthus genotypes tested in this study.

Error bars represent SE ${ \it \Delta } n = 3$ or 4).

Another interesting parameter is the ratio of $\mathrm { F v / F m } ,$ which gives a relative measure of the maximum quantum efficiency of PSIl photochemistry (Genty et al., 1989).Decreases in $\mathrm { F v / F m }$ can be due to the development of nonphotochemical quenching processesor photo damage to PSII reaction centers(Baker & Rosenqvist,2004).We observed no decrease in $\mathrm { F v / F m }$ for Fest-19 at $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ buta slight decrease (within $10 \%$ ）compared with the values measured at $2 4 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ was detected in Sac-11, Sac-12 and Gig-13 (Fig.2). This suggests that a temperature of $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ had no damaging effect on the photosynthetic apparatus in the ${ C } _ { 3 }$ grass,but that a minorlow-temperature-inducedphotoinhibition occurred in the three genotypes of miscanthus，even though the $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ values for the other tested genotypes, except Sac-10,were significantly lower than the three apparently cold-tolerant genotypes (Fig.1a). Interestingly，these other genotypes also had a significantly lower $\Phi$ PSII (Fig.1b)，which meansthat markedly less light absorbed by PSlI antennae is used forphotochemistry. Reduced $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ could be the direct result of reduced PSII efficiency due to PSII photo inhibition.

The largest decrease in $ { \boldsymbol { A } } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ when the temperature was lowered from $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ occurred in Sac-16.The plants of this genotype turned reddish violet when they were transferred from $1 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in the greenhouse to the $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ climate chamber conditions.This could be due to anthocyanin synthesis during temperature changes (Pietrini & Massacci,1998).Like Sin-3 and Sin-15,the Sac-17 genotype suffered a large reduction in $ { \boldsymbol { A } } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ after the temperature decrease to $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and turned yellow after the repositioning from the greenhouse to the climate chamber,i.e.there was a visible chlorophyll reduction. These two genotypesthus seemed to be stressed both by the warm temperatures and by subsequent cold conditions.

# Photosynthetic performance at 10 and $6 ~ ^ { \circ } C$

When the temperature was lowered to $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ further decreases in $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ and $\mathrm { F v / F m }$ values were found in miscanthus but not in festulolium (Fig.2),which indicates that additional increases in nonphotochemical quenching and/or photo damage of the PS II reaction center occurred in miscanthus.One of the major mechanisms for miscanthusto get rid of excess energy absorbed by the leaves is heat dissipation.For M. $\times$ giganteus grown at $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ high levels of nonphotochemical quenching of excitation energy has been associated with a 2O-fold increase in zeaxanthin content in dark-adapted leaves,as a photo-protective mechanism (Farage et al.,2006). Sac-11, Sac-12 and Gig-13 showed the same AQY values at $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ as at $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 4a),which further indicates that no photo damage happened to these three genotypes when the temperature was decreased from $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The significantly higher AQY values and $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 5 0 0 }$ in the three genotypes obviously would make them more suitable for cold climates than Tin-1 and Sin-15 at $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ (Fig.4)，due to their significantly higher $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ uptake under both light-limited and light-saturated conditions. No significant decrease was observed in $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ in Fest-19 during the temperature reduction from $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to 10/ $8 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ ：the relatively high ΦPSII and $\mathrm { F v / F m }$ in Fest-19 might have played a major role but it was not the only possible reason for maintaining the high photosynthetic rate.An alternative explanation might be the Rubisco content since ${ C } _ { 3 }$ species generally have three to six times as much Rubisco as $C _ { 4 }$ species (Ku et al.,1979).

Interestingly,all the miscanthus genotypes continued to display photosynthetic activity at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ though $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ was quite low for several of them (Fig.la). The values of $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ in Gig-13 grown for 6 days at, respectively, $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were 8.9 and $3 . 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ $\mathbf { s } ^ { - 1 } .$ ，which is similar to previously reported values for M. $\times$ giganteus where the photosynthetic rate was measured during short-term exposure to low temperatures. Measured values in that study were approximately $9 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l \ m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ at $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $4 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ at $5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for plants that had previously been grown at $1 4 / 1 1 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 / 1 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ respectively (Naidu et al.，2003).Thus, longterm exposure to cold temperatures down to $6 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ in $M$ = $\times$ giganteus did not have a detrimental effect on the photosynthetic apparatus. Thissuggeststhatthe decrease in photosynthetic capacity in Gig-13 and

Sac-11 at low temperatures (above $5 ~ ^ { \circ } C ^ { \cdot }$ ）could be reversed if the temperature was raised again,and our result of the temperature response curve also supported this (Fig. 5).This could be one of the reasons for the remarkable capacity of M. $\times$ giganteus to grow in cool climates and produce a much higher yield compared with another $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plant，Spartina cynosuroides，in the United Kingdom (Beale $\&$ Long, 1995). An earlier miscanthus growth model,MISCANMOD,uses a base temperature of $1 0 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } } ,$ which was considered as the starting temperature for leaf growth (Hastings et al.,20o9). Our results suggest that the base temperature for miscanthus couldbe lower than $6 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ：

The reduction in AQY in Sac-11, Sac-12 and Gig-13 from $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ to $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ might be because of a further accumulation of zeaxanthin even at the low light intensities，which reduce the light-harvesting efficiency under light-limiting conditions (Long et al.,1994;Fryer et al.，1995).However， this phenomenon wasnot observed in Fest-19，which showed no significant changes in AQY from $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 4a). This significantly higher tolerance to the cold in Fest-19 was also observed at $2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ for Fest-19 grown at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and measured at $2 ^ { \circ } C$ was $5 . 7 2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l } } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ (data not shown),which was similar to data measured forLolium perenne L. grown and measured at $2 ^ { \circ } C$ (Hoglind et al., 2011).

The significantly higher AQY and $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 1 5 0 0 }$ in Fest-19 than in the miscanthus genotypes even at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 4a) and high $ { \boldsymbol { A } } _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ at $2 ^ { \circ } C$ can support the early emergence and longer growing season of Fest-19. The daily mean temperature in Denmark in 2013 and 2014 was around $8 . 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ ranging from $- 8 . 6$ to $2 3 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ and there were about 2Oo days each year with a mean temperature below $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (data collected from climate station in Foulumgaard,Denmark, $5 6 ^ { \circ } 3 0 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N } _ { \cdot }$ ${ 9 ^ { \circ } } 3 5 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E } \rangle$ .Thus, the significantly higher photosynthesis in Fest-19 in the $2 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ temperature range can be the reason for its high biomassproductionwhengrownintemperate conditions.Yields in Denmark of more than 20 T DM $\mathrm { \ h a } ^ { - 1 }$ for this cultivar have been recorded (Manevski et al., 2015).

However，we observed a tendency of an increasing ΦPSII/ $\Phi { \cal C } { \cal O } _ { 2 }$ ratio when lowering the temperature from $1 4 / 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for all the miscanthus genotypes, but not for Fest-19. This indicates that the quantum efficiency of the electron flux through PSII relative to the quantum efficiency of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ assimilation in miscanthus increased as the temperature decreased,due to additional electron sinks. It has been suggested that elevated $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio in mature maize leaves under cold conditions is due to $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ being used as an alternative electron accepter (Fryer et al.，1998)，which isalso a mechanism for preventing photo damage to the photosynthetic apparatus (Farage et al., 2006).A previous study also found an increased $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio for $M . \times$ giganteus grown at $1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ compared with $2 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Farage et al., 2006). Photoinhibitory damage has been found to be a major challenge for $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants grown at cold temperatures, for example,maize grown at $1 7 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or below (Long et al.,1983). It seems that $M . \times$ giganteus has the ability to minimize this damage by a massive increase in zeaxanthin content to facilitate heat dissipation in conjunction with induction of electron transport to an acceptor other than $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ (Farage et al., 2006).

However, $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ leakiness from the bundle sheath cells back to mesophyll is an alternative energy expenditure in the $C _ { 4 }$ photosynthetic pathway under high light conditions.Especially at low temperatures，where the Rubisco capacity is an important limitation for sustaining $\mathrm { C _ { 4 } }$ photosynthesis (Sage,2002;Kubien et al.,2003), the $\Phi \mathrm { P S I I } / \Phi \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ratio will increase (Von Caemmerer, 2000). Increased values of ΦPSII / $\Phi { \bf C } { \bf O } _ { 2 }$ at cool temperatures have also been observed in Muhlenbergia glomerata measured at 10 and $5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ by Kubien & Sage (2004b), who concluded that leaking of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ through the bundle sheaths was increased due to limited Rubisco capacity (Rubisco content) at low temperatures.The significantly higher ΦPSII / $\Phi { \bf C } { \bf O } _ { 2 }$ ratio at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in our study might indicate that Rubisco posed a major limitation to photo synthesis in all the miscanthus genotypes but not in Fest-19.However，the underlying reasons for the increase of ΦPSI $/ \Phi { \bf C O } _ { 2 }$ were not determined in this study.

Gig-13 and Sac-11 grown at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in the present study showed much higher rates of photosynthesis at all measured temperatures from 5 to $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ than maize grown at $1 4 / 1 1 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ of $2 { - } 5 ~ { \mu } \mathrm { m o l } ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ (Naidu et al., 2003)(Fig. 5).Even though the photosynthetic rate measured at temperatures from 10 to $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ in Gig-13 and Sac-11 grown at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ wasmuch lower than that for $M . \times$ giganteus grown at $1 4 / 1 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ $( 8 { - } 2 5 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l \ \mathrm { m } } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } ,$ （2号 (Naidu et al.,2oo3)), this could to some extent be caused by the increased VPD (Fig.5)，which significantly decreased stomatal conductance (Fig. S1,A) in combination with limited Rubisco content as mentioned above The increase in VPD resulting in higher stomatal closure wasprobablythemajorreason for the low $A$ in Fest-19 during the short-term temperature increase.

Typically,the ratio between intercellular $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentrationsand ambient $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentrations $( \mathrm { c _ { i } / c _ { a } } )$ isabout 0.7 in ${ { C } _ { 3 } }$ plants (Drake et al.,1997) and 0.3-0.4 in $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants (Jones,1983).The $\mathrm { c _ { i } / c _ { a } }$ in Fest-19 decreased to $0 . 5 0 \pm 0 . 0 1$ at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ which is significantly lower than the typical value.With similar levels of $\mathrm { c _ { i } / c _ { a } }$ in Fest-19 and miscanthus genotypes at $1 5 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } } ,$ the $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ pathway was more efficient in carbon fixation. The miscanthus genotypes Gig-13 and Sac-11 had $\mathrm { c _ { i } / c _ { a } }$ values that were in the 0.3-0.4 range even at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ (Fig. S1,B),while the $\mathrm { c _ { i } / c _ { a } }$ of Sac-12 decreased to almost $0 . 2 3 \pm 0 . 0 8$ at $2 5 { } ^ { \circ } C ,$ indicating that stomatal closure was limiting $A$ in this genotype (Fig. S1,A).

# Conclusions

We found that miscanthus maintains photosynthetic activity after growing for a longer period at $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ and that several genotypes increased their photosynthesis immediately when the temperature was increased.As expected，the photosynthetic apparatus of ${ { C } _ { 3 } }$ Fest-19 was clearly more tolerant at $1 0 / 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $6 / 4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ than the $C _ { 4 }$ genotypes tested.However，also at $2 4 / 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Fest-19 was as efficient as most of the miscanthus genotypes and only Sac-12 had a significantly higher $A _ { 1 0 0 0 }$ (Fig. 1a).Fest-19 may thus overall be more productive than current miscanthus genotypes in maritime,cool, temperate climates even though not only leaf photosynthesis but a number of other physiological factors such asrespiration and partitioning to roots are decisive for productivity as well. We are currently growing Fest-19 and Gig-13 in side-by-side replicated field trials at two Danish locations to obtain data on seasonal PAR interception in green leavesas well as yield data over several years.Also，we will use the leaf photosynthesis data as well as data on portioning between plant organs to model seasonal productivity against the harvested yielddata.

Of the miscanthus genotypes,only Sac-11 seemed to have photosynthetic capacity at a similar high level as Gig-13 (Hornum） in cold conditions and to recover quickly at enhanced temperatures.Thus,Sac-11 will be a good parent for breeding new varieties with an even better cold tolerance than Gig-13 (Hornum） and for broadening the genetic diversity of miscanthus if more widespread productionin cool climates is to take place. Tin-1 did not have a high tolerance to cold conditions, as also previously found by Jiao et al. (2016).
