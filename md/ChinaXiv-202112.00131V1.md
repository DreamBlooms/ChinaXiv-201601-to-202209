We report the reconstruction method of the fast fission events in $2 5 ~ \mathrm { M e V / u } ~ ^ { 8 6 } \mathrm { K r \ + ^ { 2 0 8 } \mathrm { P b } }$ reactions at the Compact Spectrometer for Heavy IoN Experiment (CSHINE). The fisson fragments are measured by three large-area parallel plate avalanche counters,which candeliver the positionand the arrval timing information of the fragments.The start timing information is given by the radio frequency of the cyclotron. Using the velocities of the two fision fragments,the fission events are reconstructed.The broadening ofboth the velocity distribution and the azimuthaldiference of the fision fragments decrease with the folding angle,in accordance with the picture that fast fission occurs.The anisotropic angular distribution of the fission axis also reveals consistently the dynamic feature the fission events.

# 1.INTRODUCTION

2 One of the purposes of studying the heavy ion reactions   
3 (HIR) is to infer the properties of nuclear equation of state   
4 (EOS), which is an essential input in modeling and computing   
5 the evolution and properties of neutron stars and their merging   
6 [1-3].The isovector sector of the nuclear EOS,namely the   
7 density behavior of the symmetry energy $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ , has been   
8 a long-standing open question in nuclear physics.At Fermi   
9 energies,some observables have been identified to constrain   
10 $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ near normal density,including isospin diffusion,   
11 dipole polarizability and particle emissions etc [4-1O]. Very   
12 recently, the PREX II experiment has reported the result of the   
13 neutron skin thickness,which yields a stiff $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ in ten  
14 tion with previously existing constraints [11,12]. At supra  
15 saturation densities,many experiments have been progressed   
16 greatly to measure the charged pion ratios or collective flow in   
$^ { 1 7 }$ heavy ion collisions to probe $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ [13,14]. An External  
18 target Experiment on HIRFL-CSR(CEE)is under construc  
19 tion for the studies on this direction [15,16].   
20 Nuclear fission is a large-amplitude collective motion   
21 mode involving up to hundreds of nucleons. Recently the   
22 studies on nuclear fission have been revived for its signifi  
23 cance in both nuclear physics and astrophysics.In the stel  
$2 4$ lar environment,the abundance of the nuclide in $A \approx 1 6 0$   
25 region is significantly influenced by the recycling of the fis  
26 sion products [17-19].Theoretically,statistical fission has   
27 been described well by microscopical theories and various   
28 phenomenological approaches [2O-32]. When the excita  
29 tion energy or the angular momentum becomes much high,   
3o as achieved in HIRs well above the Coulomb barrier, the   
31 fission barrier tends to vanish． As a consequence,the fis  
32 sion time scale becomes shorter by a factor of 1O to 100   
33 and the variance of the mass asymmetry increases signifi  
34 cantly (the mass asymmetry $\eta$ of the two fragments can be   
35 larger than O.6),compared to the statistical fission [33-37].   
36 In this case, the dynamic feature of the fission process is of   
37 significance and the transport models have been successfully   
38 applied to describe the fast fission process [38-46].Time  
39 dependent Hartree-Fock theory can also give an excellent de  
40 scription of fast fission starting with large deformation [47].   
41Experimentally,fast fission,usuallytermedasdynamicfis  
42 sion because of its vanishing fission barrier and short time   
43 scale,has been investigated in various systems in the last three   
44 decades [48-54].   
45 The topic of fast fission with the simultaneous emission of   
46 the particles deserves further investigations because the fis  
$_ { 4 7 }$ sioning system provides an appropriate laboratory to probe   
48 $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ . The connection between the studies of fast fission   
49 and $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ has been recently established by the simula  
50 tions with improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD)   
51 [55,56]. It is suggested that fast fission process follow  
52 ing HIR carries the effect of $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ and provides sensi  
53 tive probes,because of the formation of the low-density and   
54 neutron-rich neck and oflarger surface of two fragments com  
55 pared to the non-fission process [56,57]. The isospin content   
56 of the light particles emitted from the fast fission events has   
$^ { 5 7 }$ been used to probe $E _ { \mathrm { s y m } } ( \rho )$ experimentally [10].   
58 In order to conduct the experimental studies of the fast fis  
59 sion and the coincident emission of light charged particles   
6o (LCP) and intermediate mass fragments (IMFs),a compact   
61 spectrometer for heavy ion experiment(CSHINE) has been   
62 built [58, 59]. While the LCPs and IMFs are measured using   
63 the silicon strip detector telescopes (SSDT) [6O,61], the fis  
64 sion fragments are measured by the parallel plate avalanche   
65 counters (PPACs) [62].

66 In this paper, we present the measurement of fast fission $6 7$ in $^ { 8 6 } \mathrm { K r + ^ { \bar { 2 } 0 8 } P b }$ reactions with CSHINE in its second phase. 68 After a brief introduction to the phase-I setup of CSHINE in 69 section I, the reconstruction of velocity of the FF will be in7o troduced in Section III and the dynamic feature of fast fission $^ { 7 1 }$ are presented in Section IV. Section V is the summary.

74 The beam experiment was performed at the Radioactive   
75Ion Beam Line I(RIBLL1) on the Heavy Ion Research Fa  
76 cility in Lanzhou (HIRFL),China．The $^ { 2 0 8 } \mathrm { { P b } }$ target of 1   
$\mathrm { 7 7 ~ m g / c m ^ { 2 } }$ areal density was bombarded with $2 5 \ \mathrm { M e V / u } \ ^ { 8 6 } \mathrm { K r }$   
78 beam. The charged reaction products are measured using   
79 CSHINE,which are installed in a large scattering cham  
8o ber located at the final focal plane of RIBLL1．In the cur  
81 rent experiment,three PPACs are installed for fission frag   
82 ment measurements to reconstruct the reaction geometry. Be  
83 sides,four SSDTs are installed covering the polar angle range   
$_ { 8 4 } ~ 1 0 ^ { \circ } ~ < ~ \theta _ { \mathrm { l a b } } ~ < 6 0 ^ { \circ }$ . The SSDT is a three-layer detector with   
85 a single-sided SSD(SSSSD) for $\Delta E _ { 1 }$ as layer1,a double  
86 sided SSD (DSSSD) for $\Delta E _ { 2 }$ as layer2 and a $3 \times 3$ CsI (Tl)   
87 array for residual energy measurements as layer 3.Both of the   
88 SSSSD and the DSSSD are the BB7 type ( $2 \mathrm { m m }$ strip width,   
89 32 strips each side) from MICRON Company. Each CsI(Tl)   
9o crystal is a square pyramid with a dimension of $\mathrm { 2 3 \times 2 3 ~ m m ^ { 2 } }$   
91 of the front side, $2 7 \times 2 7 ~ \mathrm { { m m ^ { 2 } } }$ of the rear side and $5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ of   
92 the height.The Photo Diode(HAMAMATSU S32O4) isused   
93 to read out the signal from CsI.Fig.1 presents the detector   
94 setup of CSHINE in the experiment.For the details and the   
95 performance of CSHINE,one can refer to [58,59]. Table 1   
96 presents the distance $d$ fromthe center of each detector to the   
97 target, the polar angle $\theta$ ,the azimuthal angle $\phi$ and the sen  
98 sitive area $S$ of the SSDTs and the PPACs in the experiment.   
99 The thicknesses of the $\Delta E _ { 1 }$ and $\Delta E _ { 2 }$ for each SSDT are also   
10o listed.

The fission fragment detector,PPAC,is a kind of multi

102 wire chamber working in the region of limited proportion  
103 ality. The signals induced by the incident fragments on an   
104 individual wire of the anode plane,either $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { X }$ or Y,are trans  
105 ferred through a delay line to both ends.The time delay of   
106 the two signals $X _ { 1 }$ and $X _ { 2 }$ 0 $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot Y _ { 1 } \mathbf { \nabla }$ and $Y _ { 2 }$ ）withrespect to the   
107 signal collected on the cathode plane,which delivers the tim  
108 ing information，gives the $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ (Y）position of the hit in the   
109 sensitive area.Fig.2 presents the schematic view of the me  
110 chanics of the PPAC.The total thickness of the sensitive gas   
111 volume is about $2 \ \mathrm { c m }$ .The PPACs were operated with 4.5   
112 mbar isobutane at $4 6 5 ~ \mathrm { V }$ voltage.Under this condition, the   
113 fission fragments can be recorded with efficiency above $9 5 \%$   
114 but the LCPs and IMFs are suppressed.   
115 Fig. 3 (b) shows a two-dimensional histogram of $Y _ { 1 } - Y _ { 2 }$   
116 US $X _ { 1 } - X _ { 2 }$ for PPAC1 as an example. The projections to $\mathrm { \Delta X }$   
117 and Y direction are plotted in Fig. 3 (a) and (c),respectively.   
118 A good performance in timing, corresponding to good posi  
119 tion resolution,manifests itself in the sharp boundary for the   
120 two-dimensional distribution and the well-separated individ  
121 ual peaks on the projections.The distance of the neighboring   
122 Wires is $4 \mathrm { m m }$ ,and there are 61 peaks and 71 peaks in Fig. 3   
123 (a) and (c),respectively. The time resolution of $\sigma _ { \mathrm { T } } = 3 0 0$ ps   
124 and the position resolution of $\sigma _ { \mathrm { r } } = 1 . 3 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ can be derived   
125 from the data.The overall performance of the PPACs can be   
126 found in [62].   
127 SSDTs are used to measure the LCPs and IMFs in coinci  
128 dence with the fission fragments.To reduce the total num  
129 ber of electronics,each neighboring strips are merged in one   
130 channel, correspondingly the granularity is reduced. Multi   
131 tracks may fire each SSDT.In order to reconstruct the tracks   
132 in the SSDTs,a novel algorithm has been developed with spe  
133 cial care on the charging sharing effect.More than $80 \%$ of the   
134 hits inall layers of the SSDTs can be recognized and assigned   
135 to certain tracks.For details,one can refer to [60].   
136 The trigger system of CSHINE was designed for both beam   
137 experiment and calibration. The timing signals of PPACs   
138 Were discriminated by CF8OOO and logically calculated by a   
139 CO4O2O to generate the PPAC inclusive signals and PPAC   
140 two body coincidence signals.The logic hit signals of SSDTs   
141 Were extracted by the front-side of the DSSSD $( \Delta E _ { 2 } )$ with   
142 the discrimination of MSCF-16,which generates an analog   
143 Multi-Trig signal proportional to the number of fired strips in   
144 the same module(16 channels).Both inclusive and exclusive   
145 logic signals can be generated by discriminating the Multi  
146 Trig signal at different threshold settings.In beam experi  
147 ment, the trigger signal contains SSD two body events,PPAC   
148 two body events and the coincidence of PPAC two body with   
149 SSD one body events.Besides,the inclusive trigger for every   
150 individual detector were also constructed, optionally turned   
151 on for the detector calibration before or after the beam data  
152 taking.For details,one can refer to [60].

# III.RECONSTRUCTIONOFTHEVELOCITY

176 SSDT3.Fig. 4(a) presents the correlation between the $\alpha$ en  
177 ergy and the TOF derived by eq.(1). The theoretical curve   
178 fitting the $E / O F$ profile applies a constant $C _ { \mathrm { d e t } } = 4 3 1 . 8$ ns.   
179 Panel (b) presents the difference between the $T O F$ measured   
180 by TDC and thevalue $L / v ( E _ { \alpha } )$ ，with $\boldsymbol { v }$ being derived from   
181 the energy $E _ { \alpha }$ and $L$ is the distance from the target to hit   
182 position in SSDT3.The width of 1.3 ns is obtained by the   
183 Gaussian fitting. Subtracting the contribution of the energy   
184 uncertainty, the resolution of about 1.O ns of the $T O F$ is ob  
185 tained for SSDT.For the FF measured in PPACs,the $T O F$   
186 resolution will be comparable because the timing resolution   
187 of PPACs is $3 0 0 \mathrm { p s }$ , slightly better than the SSDT.   
154 We concentrate on the reconstruction of the fission events.   
155 The flying path of the fission fragments (FFs) can be well   
156 determined by the PPACs delivering good position informa  
157 tion．The velocity of each FF,on the other hand,is derived   
158 from the timing information. In our experiment, the starting   
159 time information are provided by the radio frequency (RF) of   
160 the accelerator. The RF signal,usually a signal in sinusoidal   
161 form,is discriminated by CF8OOO module and input to the   
162 time-digital-converter(TDC). Generally, for a particle firing   
163 a given detector, the time of flight $( T O F )$ is written as

![](images/fb1d1da368783004db0d0527386e5eef0e835ff6c941f45c4a7b0092173cb5cf.jpg)  
Fig.4. (a) Correlation of the TOF signal and the energy of $\alpha$ particlesrecorded by SSDT3,and(b) The distribution of the time difference between the TDC measurement and the calculated value from the calibrated energy.

$$
T O F = t _ { \mathrm { d e t } } - t _ { \mathrm { R F } } - C _ { \mathrm { d e t } }
$$

165 where $t _ { \mathrm { d e t } }$ and $t _ { \mathrm { R F } }$ are the time signals of the detector and   
166 the RF,recorded by the corresponding TDC channels,respec  
167 tively.The unit of both signals are calibrated in ns using pre  
168 cise time calibrator. $C _ { \mathrm { d e t } }$ is a constant representing a fixed   
169 delay in electronics.The velocity is then computed by

$$
v = { \frac { L } { T O F } }
$$

173 Inordertoverifythevalidityof theabovemethodto mea$1 7 4$ sure the $T O F$ ，we use the calibrated $\alpha$ particles,where the 175 velocityis alternatively derived from the energy measured in

171 where $L$ is the length of the flight path from the target to $^ { 1 7 2 }$ the hit position where the particle fires on the detector.

188 With the validity eq. (1),we can discuss the $T O F$ of the $1 8 9$ FFs. Since PPACs can not identify the charge or mass of the $1 9 0$ FFs,nor the total kinetic energy,one relies on the determina191 tion of the velocities which requires the $T O F$ information and $1 9 2$ the lengths of the flight path $L$ .In eq.(1),the relative differ$1 9 3$ ence of the delay constants, $C _ { \mathrm { p p a c 1 } } - C _ { \mathrm { p p a c 2 } }$ ， between two $_ { 1 9 4 }$ PPACs can be adjusted to zero using pulser prior to the exper$1 9 5$ iment and the systematic uncertainty can be well controlled 196 within $\pm 2$ ns. However, the absolute value of $C _ { \mathrm { p p a c } }$ of each 197 individual PPAC can not be determined like in the SSDT, be198 cause the particle type and the total energy is unknown. To 199 overcome this difficulty,we use the Viola systematics that the 20o relative velocity of the FFs is averagely $2 . 4 \mathrm { c m / n s }$ [63] . And 201 hence, by tuning the constants $C _ { \mathrm { p p a c } }$ , one can optimized the 202 value at $\langle v _ { \mathrm { F F } } \rangle = 2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { c m / n s }$ . Fig.5 presents the distribu203 tion of $v _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ at different delay constants. One can readily see $2 0 4$ that varying the delay constant by1 ns,the peak position of 205 $v _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ moves significantly. In our experiment, $C _ { \mathrm { p p a c } } = 1 1 5 . 5$ 206 ns is optimized,and the corresponding distribution of $v _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ is 207 plotted in panel (b）.Known from transport model calcula208 tions,the variation of $\langle v _ { \mathrm { F F } } \rangle$ is better than $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { c m / n s }$ ,asys209 tematic uncertainty of 2 ns of the $T O F$ ofFFs is estimated, 210 on which the conclusion of the following analysis will not 211 changed. We recall that the coincident events recorded by 212 PPAC1 with PPAC2 (marked by $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 2 )$ or with PPAC3 213 (marked by $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 3 \rangle$ are the fission fragments,since the 214 HV condition is set that the response of PPAC to energetic 215 LCPs and IMFs are totally suppressed, given that the energy

216 loss of these particles is lower than FFs by more than one   
217 order of magnitude.In addition,the correlation between a   
218 heavy projectile-like fragment (PLF) and a target-like frag   
219 ment(TLF) is out of the current geometrical coverage.

# IV. RESULTSANDDISCUSSIONS

Before discussing the reconstruction of the fission events, we first define the kinetics of the fission.In the picture ofincomplete fusion,a heavy TLFis formed in the fusion of part of the projectile and the target. The fraction of the momentum of the projectile transferred to the TLF is called linear momentum transfer (LMT).With a certain probability depending on the total angular momentum of the reaction system, the TLF may undergo fission or fast fission in competition with the emission residue channel. For the fission events,Fig.6 presents the kinetic geometry of the TLF fission event. As shown,the origin point $\mathrm { ~ o ~ }$ is the target nucleus in the laboratory system,the vector $\mathrm { { 0 0 ^ { \prime } } }$ represents the direction of the beam. The velocity vectors $\Vec { v } _ { \mathrm { f _ { 1 } } }$ and $\vec { v } _ { \mathrm { f } _ { 2 } }$ of the two fission fragments in the laboratory system are represented by OA and OB. $\vec { v } _ { \mathrm { t l } }$ isthe velocity of the TLF,and the velocities of the two fragments in the center-of-mass system of the fissioning TLF are represented by $\vec { v } _ { \mathrm { f _ { 1 } } } ^ { \prime }$ and $\vec { v _ { \mathrm { f _ { 2 } } } } ^ { \prime }$ sitting back-to-back collinearly. Here,we define plane OAB as the fission plane, plane $\mathrm { { 0 0 } ^ { \prime } A }$ as the projection plane,and the reaction plane is definedasplane $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { D O O ^ { ' } } }$ ：

241 Once the $T O F$ is determined, the velocity of the FFs can   
242 be computed event-by-event using the hit positions of the FFs   
243 in PPACs.Then the whole fission event can be reconstructed.   
244 Fig.7 presents the distribution of the velocity of the fission   
245 fragments in $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 2$ and $\mathrm { P P A C 1 \times 3 }$ events,respec  
246 tively. Here the $v _ { \mathrm { f _ { 1 } } }$ is for the FF recorded in PPAC1 and $v _ { \mathrm { f _ { 2 } } }$ is   
247 for the FF in PPAC2(PPAC3) in $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 2$ $( { \mathrm { P P A C 1 } } \times 3 )$ （2   
248 events.It is shown that for the $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 2$ events, since the   
249 two PPACs are nearly symmetric W.r.t the beam,the distribu  
250 tions of $v _ { \mathrm { f _ { 1 } } }$ and $v _ { \mathrm { f _ { 2 } } }$ are very similar. Meanwhile,high velocity   
251 tail is evidently presented in the $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 2$ events and the   
252 velocity spectra are wider than that in $\mathrm { P P A C 1 \times 3 }$ events.   
253 This component is mainly due to the events with smaller fold  
254 ing angle corresponding to largerLMT,as will be discussed   
255 below.   
256 After thevelocities of the two FFs aredetermined, the fold  
257 ing angle method can be applied to calculate the LMT of the   
258 reaction.Recalling the definitions in Fig. 6, the folding angle   
259 $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ is defined as the angle $\angle A O C$ ，spanned bythe projec  
$2 6 0$ tion of the velocity vectors of the FFs on the projection plane.   
$2 6 1$ Clearly, given the velocities $\Vec { v } _ { \mathrm { f _ { 1 } } }$ and $\Vec { v } _ { \mathrm { f _ { 2 } } }$ ,the folding angle de  
262 pends on the velocity of the TLF $v _ { \mathrm { t l } }$ ,i.e.,the larger $v _ { \mathrm { t l } }$ ，the   
263 smaller $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ . Fig.8 presents the distribution of the folding   
$2 6 4$ angle $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ .The coincident events of $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 2$ distribute   
265 in the range between $7 0 ^ { \circ } - 1 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ with the peak situating at   
266 about $9 5 ^ { \circ }$ ，corresponding to a larger LMT (red)，while the   
267 $\mathrm { P P A C 1 \times 3 }$ events sit in the range of $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } - 1 7 0 ^ { \circ }$ corre  
268 sponds to a smallerLMT (blue).The valley between the two   
269 components is simply due to the deficiency caused by the gap   
270 between PPAC2 and PPAC3,and the efficiency arising from   
271 the incomplete azimuthal coverage is not corrected in the plot.   
272As the fission geometry is determined by the two velocity   
273 vectors,it is of interest to look at the planarity of the fission   
274 events. Fig. 9 (a) present the azimuth correlation of the two   
275 FFs by scattering plot between the azimuthal angle difference   
276 $\Delta \phi$ and the folding angle $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ . It is clearly shown that for the   
FFs from both the central and peripheral reactions,the most   
278 probable value situates at $\Delta \phi = 1 8 0 ^ { \circ }$ following the picture   
that the system undergoes a binary decay. Here we note that   
280 the $\Delta \phi$ isa directly measurable quantity relying on no as  
281 sumption. The inset displays the projection distribution of   
282 $\Delta \phi$ ,astandard deviation of about $\sigma ( \Delta \phi ) \approx 1 0 ^ { \circ }$ is derived.   
283 Such broadening suggests that the emission of LCPs or IMFs   
284 may change the flight direction of the FF and smear the back  
285 to-back feature of the fission event. In order to see its evolu  
286 tion with the violence of the reaction,we plot in panel (b) the   
287 standard deviation of azimuthal angle $\sigma ( \Delta \phi )$ as a function   
288 of folding angle $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ . It is shown that $\sigma ( \Delta \phi )$ decreases with   
289 $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ in the whole range,with an exception near $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } } \approx 1 3 0 ^ { \circ }$ ，   
290 where a discontinuity appears due to the gap between PPAC2   
291 and PPAC3．To exclude the possible reason that this trend   
292 originates from the asymmetry of the geometrical locations of   
293 the PPACs,we restrict further the analysis on the events with   
294 the two FFs flying symmetrically to the beam direction,i.e.,   
295 with the condition of $\theta _ { 1 } = \theta _ { 2 }$ ，where $\theta _ { i }$ is the polar angle of   
296 the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ fragment. The result is depicted by the black squares,   
297 where the bin width of each $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ is $\pm 2 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ . This condition   
298 is applicable only for the $\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \times 2$ fission events because   
299 these two PPACs are placed in approximate left-right sym  
30o metry with respect to the beam line.Clearly seen,the data   
301 points with the symmetry condition are sitting on top of those   
302 without the condition, suggesting that the decreasing trend of   
303 $\sigma ( \Delta \phi )$ as function of $\Theta _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ is truly due to the reaction vio  
304 lence. Since the post-scission particle emission changes the   
305 velocity of the FF due to recoil effect, the trend suggests that   
306 in the fission following the intermediate energy heavy ion re  
307 actions,there is sufficient excitation energy left at the scission   
308 point depending on LMT. In the reactions with larger LMT,   
309 more excitation energy is left and released through the parti  
310 cle emission in the post-scission stage.It is consistent with   
311 the picture of fast fission,instead of statistic fission in which   
312 the excitation energy is nearly depleted at the scission point.   
313 The dynamic feature of the fast fission can be further ex  
314 plored from the velocity distribution of the FFs.We present   
315 in Fig.1O the average(a) and the standard deviation (b) of   
316 the velocities of the FFs recorded in the PPACs as a func  
317 tion of folding angle. From panel (a),it can be seen that   
318 the average velocity value $\langle v _ { \mathrm { f } } \rangle$ decreases with the folding an  
319 gle.Panel (b) presents the standard deviation of the velocity   
320 $\sigma ( v _ { f } )$ ,and it is also clear that the broadening of the velocity   
321 of the FFs decreases with the folding angle.This result is con  
322 sistent with the picture seen in the trend of $\sigma ( \Delta \phi )$ in figure 9.   
323 The scission point is early reached when the excitation energy   
324 of the fissioning TLF is still high,thus,the statistical fluctu  
325 ation(corresponding to the left excitation energy） enhances   
326 the variance of the velocity of the FF.This is consistent with   
327 the earlier experimental observation in $\mathrm { A r + ^ { 2 0 9 } }$ Bi reactions   
328at $2 5 \mathrm { { M e V / u } }$ [64, 65].

9 Finally, the dynamic feature of the fast fission may also ）cause the anisotropy of the angular distribution of the fission •axis.Here the fission axis is defined as the vector of the rel：ativevelocity $\vec { v } _ { F F }$ from the $\mathrm { f _ { 2 } }$ to $\mathrm { f _ { 1 } }$ ，where $\mathrm { f _ { 1 } }$ and $\mathrm { f _ { 2 } }$ are the ；two fragments.The angle of the fission axis $\Lambda _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ is the ani gle of the fission axis W.r.t. the beam axis,as defined in [55]. ；Usually, the experimental measurement of the distribution of ； $\Lambda _ { \mathrm { F F } }$ requires fine correction of the geometric efficiency,and ，hence it is better feasible using $4 \pi$ detecting system.

In our experiment,PPACs cover only part of the whole space,in order to introduce less ambiguity to the geometry efficiency correction,we fix the direction of the first FF in PPAC1. In this case,we need only to correct the efficiency of

359 $\Lambda _ { \mathrm { F F } } < 8 0 ^ { \circ }$ .Regardless of the kink area and the uncovered   
360 region within $\Lambda _ { \mathrm { F F } } < 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ ,it is shown that the distribution of   
361 $d N / d \cos ( \Lambda _ { \mathrm { F F } } )$ increases steadily with $\cos ( \Lambda _ { \mathrm { F F } } )$ and tends   
362 to peak at forward angle,which is at variance with the expec  
363 tation of isotropic distribution for statistic fission.The trend

# V. SUMMARY

367 In summary,the fission fragments in $2 5 \mathrm { \ M e V / u }$ $^ { 8 6 } \mathrm { K r }$   
$^ { 3 6 8 } \ + ^ { 2 0 8 } \mathrm { P b }$ reactions have been measured with CSHINE detec  
369 tion system.At current phase three PPACs and four SSDTs   
370 are mounted to measure the fission fragments and the coinci  
371 dent LCPs and IMFs,respectively. Using the timing and posi  
372 tion signals of the PPACs and the start timing from the RF of   
373 the accelerator, one can measure the velocities of the fission   
374 fragments and reconstruct the fission events,where the lin  
375 ear momentum transfer can be derived by the folding angle.   
376 It is shown that,the width of the azimuthal angle difference,   
377 the mean value and the width of the velocity distribution of   
378 the fission fragments decrease with the folding angle. The   
379 anisotropic angular distribution of fission axis has been ob  
380 served. The results are consistent with the picture that fast   
381 fission occurs.Prospectively,with the ability of reconstruct  
382 ing the fission events,CSHINE provides the opportunities in   
383 the studies of isospin dynamics and nuclear symmetry energy   
384 by further counting the coincident isotope-resolved LCPs and   
385 IMFs.
