# ABSTRACT

An insightful study on the fundamental lithium storage behavior of al-solid-state lithium battery with a structure of $\mathrm { L i N i } _ { 0 . 8 } \mathsf { C o } _ { 0 . 1 5 } \mathsf { A l } _ { 0 . 0 5 } \mathsf { O } _ { 2 }$ 0 $\mathrm { N C A } ) / \mathrm { L i _ { 1 0 } G e P _ { 2 } S _ { 1 2 } } / \mathrm { L i } \mathrm { - I r }$ 1is carried out in this work.The relationship between electrochemical performances and particle size,surface impurities and defects of the NCA positive material is systematically investigated.It is found that a ball-milling technique can decrease the particle size and remove surface impurities of the NCA cathode while also give rise to surface defects which could be recovered bya post-annealing process.The results indicate that the interfacial resistance between the NCA and $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ is obviously decreased during the ball-milling followed bya postannealing. Consequently, the discharge capacity of NCA in the $\mathrm { N C A } / \mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 } / \mathrm { L i } -$ Insolid-state battery is significantly enhanced,which exhibits a discharge capacity of $1 4 6 \mathrm { \ m A h \ g ^ { - 1 } }$ at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$

# 1.Introduction

Lithium ion batteries have been widely used in portable electronic devices,such as laptops and cell phones [1]. The developing electric vehicles and energy storage devices for power stations have greatly expanded the market of lithium secondary batteries. However, the wide application of lithium ion batteries is mainly restricted by the safety problem due to extensive use of inflammable organic ethers electrolytes [2].As an alternative option,allsolid-state lithium batteries (ASSLiBs)，utilizing non-flammable inorganic materials as solid electrolytes,could provide an ultimate solution to solve the safety issue of lithium ion batteries [3,4].

The electrochemical performances of ASSLiBs are highly related withthe ionic conductivityof solid electrolytes,cathodematerials and the interfacial impedance between solid electrolyte and cathode.Up to now,the sulfide-based solid electrolytes such as $\mathrm { L i } _ { 3 . 2 5 } \mathrm { G e } _ { 0 . 2 5 } \mathrm { P } _ { 0 . 7 5 } \mathrm { S } _ { 4 } ,$ ， $x \mathrm { L i } _ { 2 } S { - } ( 1 ~ - ~ x ) \mathrm { P } _ { 2 } S _ { 5 } ,$ and $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ ，exhibit lithium ion conductivities in the order of $1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ to $1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { S } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at room temperature [5-7],which is comparable to the liquid organic electrolytes.Therefore,the lithium ion conductivityof solid electrolytes may not be the main obstacle in ASSLiBs.

Asfor positive materials in ASSLBs with sulfide solid electrolytes,most studies emphasized on $\operatorname { L i C o O } _ { 2 }$ intercalation compounds despite their limited discharge capacity $( \sim 1 2 0 \mathrm { \ m A h \ g ^ { - 1 } } .$ [4,8,9]. By comparison, $\mathrm { L i N i } _ { 0 . 8 } \mathrm { C o } _ { 0 . 1 5 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 0 . 0 5 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ （NCA）is feasible to exhibit a higher discharge capacity with lower cost[1O],and is suitable to improve the energy density of solid-state lithium cells [11].However, the discharge capacity of NCA in ASSLBs is largely reduced due to the large interfacial resistance between the NCA and sulfide electrolytes compared with that in lithiumion batterieswith liquid electrolytes[12-14].Besides the space charge layer and structure deterioration induced by element co-diffusion [12,15],the high interfacial impedance could be attributed to the poor physical contact of solid powders[13,16] and surface defects (or impurities) of positive materials [14,15]. Some effcient strategies have been conducted to reduce the interfacial resistance between cathode and electrolyte[11,13,16,17].The NCA particles with a surface coating of $\mathrm { L i } _ { 4 } \mathrm { T i } _ { 5 } 0 _ { 1 2 }$ were synthesized by Seino et al.and used as cathode in ASSLiBs with $7 0 \% \mathrm { L i } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } { - } 3 0 \% \mathrm { P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 5 }$ glass ceramic solid electrolyte. The results state that the interfacial resistance is significantly reduced compared with that of uncoated NCA,resulting inan improved high rate capability[11].Visbal reported that eliminatingabsorbed impurities on NCA surface by heating NCA powders at $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in vacuum could reduce the interfacial resistance as well [17]. In our previous study[18],it is found that the interfacial resistance is also affected by the ionic conductivityof solid electrolytesin ASSLiBs with NCA cathode. The $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ solid electrolyte not only displays a higher ionic conductivity than that of $\mathrm { L i } _ { 3 . 2 5 } \mathrm { G e } _ { 0 . 2 5 } \mathrm { P } _ { 0 . 7 5 } \mathrm { S } _ { 4 }$ solid electrolyte,butalso has lower interfacial resistance with NCA positive material, leading to better electrochemical performances including rate capability and cycling stability as well as low temperature performances.However, the effect of cathode structure and morphology (i.e. particle size,surface impurities and defects as well as morphology）on the electrochemical performances in ASSLiBs is still not set up and unclear.

In this work,a systematical investigation on the fundamental lithium storage behavior of NCA in ASSLiBs was carried out.The relationship between electrochemical performances and NCA structure and morphology was revealed.Ball-milling followed by post-annealing are applied to decrease the particle size and surface defects，which could improve physical contacts and interface chemical stability between the NCA particles and sulfide solid electrolyte,giving rise toa significantly improved electrochemical performances.The results provided new insight for improving the lithium storage capability ofNCA cathode in ASSLiBs,which could bealsoapplied in the other cathode systems for ASSLiBs.

# 2.Experimental

The $\mathrm { N i _ { 0 . 8 } C o _ { 0 . 1 5 } A l _ { 0 . 0 5 } ( O H ) _ { 2 } }$ precursor (Jintian New Energy Co.,

Ltd.）was mixed with $\mathrm { L i O H \cdot H _ { 2 } O }$ $9 9 . 9 \%$ ，Aladdin Chemistry. Co., Ltd.) in the mortar with a molar ratio of $1 / 1 . 0 2 \$ .The mixture was preheated at $5 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ for $^ { 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,and subsequently sintered at $7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ or $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ in a continuous oxygen flow. The assintered samples were named as S70o,S75O and S80O respectively.The sample S75O was ground by ball-milling for $^ { 1 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ in ethanol usinga planetary ball mill apparatus,and then dried at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ (labeled as $S 7 5 0 – \mathrm { m } ;$ .Thesample $s { 7 } 5 0 – \mathrm { m }$ was divided into three parts,which were annealed at the temperature of $7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ and $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $^ { 5 \mathrm { h } }$ in oxygen,respectively. Accordingly, the post-annealed sampleswere denoted as PA7oo,PA750,and PA800.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were employed to characterize the structure of samples on Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu $\mathrm { K } \alpha$ radiation $( \lambda ~ = ~ 1 . 5 4 1 7 8 ~ \mathrm { \normalfont ~ \AA } )$ .The morphology was analyzed by S-48oo field emission scanning electron microscopy(FE-SEM). Raman spectra were measured with a Renishaw in Via-Reflex Raman spectrophotometer using the $5 3 2 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ spectra.X-ray photoelectron spectra(XPS) were collected on a Kratos AXIS ULTRADLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The spectrum fitting was applied with CasaXPS software.

$\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ wasused as the solid electrolyte for the assembly of ASSLiBs. The $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ solid electrolytes Was prepared by solidstate reaction method and the details of $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ can be found elsewhere [18].For the composite cathode,the as-synthesized NCA powder was mixed with the $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ solid electrolytes in weight ratio of 7O:3O using an agate mortar.Li-In alloy foil $( 9 9 . 9 \%$ Alfa Aesar）was used as a counter electrode.ASSLiBs of $\operatorname { L i - I n } /$ $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 } / \mathrm { N C A }$ were fabricated as follow: $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m g }$ of the $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ electrolyte was first placed into a teflon tube of $1 0 \mathrm { m m }$ indiametertomakean electrolyte layerat $2 4 0 \mathsf { M P a }$ . Then, $7 \mathrm { m g }$ of the above cathode composite powder was uniformly spread onto the electrolyte layer and pressed at the same pressure.Li-In alloy used as counter electrode was similarly placed on the other side of the electrolyte layer.At last, theall componentswere compressed togetherat $3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { M P a }$ .The cellswere charged and discharged in a galvanostatic mode at room temperature.As the potential of Li-In alloy is 0.62 Vvs $\mathrm { L i / L i ^ { + } }$ ，the cut-off voltage was set to be 3.7-2.3 V.Thecurrentrate of charge/dischargeis0.1C 0 $1 \mathsf { C } = 1 2 0 \mathsf { m A } \mathsf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ).Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out after the cell was charged to $3 . 7 \mathrm { V }$ for the second time on a Solartron 147O E multi-channel potentiostats electrochemical workstation in a frequency range from O.1 to $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { H z }$ with the amplitude of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m V } .$

Electrochemical performances of S750，S750-m and PA750 samples in lithium-ion batteries with the liquid electrolyte were carried out with a CR2o23-type coin cell as described in previous work[19]. The working electrode was composed of $80 \mathrm { w t \% }$ active materials, $10 \mathrm { \Delta w t \% }$ polyvinylidene fluoride(PVDF) and $1 0 \%$ acetylene black.Lithium metal wasused as counter electrodes.The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with $1 \mathrm { \ M L i P F _ { 6 } }$ in EC and DMC(LB-3O1,China) as the electrolyte and Celgard 26oO as the separator.The cells were charged and discharged ina galvanostatic mode at room temperature.The cut-off voltage was set to be $3 . 0 { - } 4 . 3 \ \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ and the current rate of charge/discharge is 0.1C 0 $: 1 { \mathsf { C } } = 1 8 0 \ \mathrm { m A } \ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } .$ ）

# 3.Resultsanddiscussion

Fig.1 shows the powder XRD patterns of NCA obtained at different experimental conditions.All the reflections are indexed as a hexagonal lattice of $\scriptstyle \alpha - \ N a \ F e O _ { 2 }$ structure with a $R \overline { { 3 } } \ m$ space group [20,21],and no extra diffraction peaks are observed.Clearly, the XRD patterns show the splits of peaks (006)/(102) and (O08)/(110), which is the characteristic of a highly ordered layered structure [22].Besides,the layered structure is further confirmed with the lattice constant ratios of $c / a$ ，which are larger than 4.9 for all samples [23],as listed in Table 1.Moreover,itis known that the integrated intensityratio of $I ( 0 0 3 ) / I ( 1 0 4 )$ (definedasR) issensitive to the cation mixing in the lattice and usually used to measure the degree of cation mixing in the series of layered oxide materials. Generally, $R < 1 . 2$ means undesirable cation mixing [24]. Here,the R values for all untreated samples(S7oo,S750,S8oO）were lower than 1.2 (as shown in Table1),which indicated that the samples had undesirable cation mixing. The morphologies of NCA were observed by FE-SEM,as shown in Fig.2.S700,S75O and S800 samplesare comprised of spherical secondary particles witha size of $5 { - } 1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,whichare composed of primaryparticleswitha size of $1 0 0 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .And the size of primary particles grows up with the increase of sintering temperatures.

The initial charge/discharge voltage profiles for S7oo, S75O and S800 samples are shown in Fig.3.The specific discharge capacity of S700,S750 and S800 are only 46.7 mAh $\mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ，51mAh $\dot { \mathbf { g } } ^ { - 1 }$ 37 mAh $\mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively.All samples exhibit an inferior specific capacity,which could be attributed to the undesired cation mixing, inappropriate particle size distribution and morphologyas observed above.In order to further understand and improve the lithium storage behavior, S75O samples are selected to be ballmilled and postannealed for deeper investigation.

Afterfurther ball-millingand post-annealing,the Rvalues for PA700,PA75O and PA8OO samples were significant higher than 1.2 (Table1),suggesting effectively decrease the undesirable cation mixing.Furthermore,the cell parameters $c$ firstly increase with the sintering temperature and then decrease with the increasing of post-annealed temperature,as shown in Fig.1c and Table 1.XPS measurements of S750,S750-m and PA750 samples were conducted to further understand the changes of nickel on the surface of $\mathrm { L i N i } _ { 0 . 8 } \mathrm { C o } _ { 0 . 1 5 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 0 . 0 5 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ Chemical environment of nickle was analyzed in detail,as shown in Fig.4,both of $\mathsf { N i } ^ { 2 + }$ cation and $\mathsf { N i } ^ { 3 + }$ cation coexist on the surface of S750,S750-m and PA750 samples.The intensity of the peaks corresponding to ${ \mathsf { N i } } ^ { 2 + }$ cation firstly increase after ball milling and then significantly decrease after postannealing.The effect of ball-milling and post-annealing on the morphologies of NCA is shown Fig.5.Obviously,the secondary particles are smashed into small particles by ball-milling process, and the average size is about $1 { - } 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ，Surface defects such as cracks,poresand small particle are clearlyobserved on the $S 7 5 0 – \mathrm { m }$ particles.The post-annealing at $7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ doesn't change particle size. After post-annealing at $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ，most surface defects have been eliminated，but some residual cracks and vague surface are observed.With higher post-annealing temperature of $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ small particles are agglomerated into second particles with a size of $3 { \mathrm { - } } 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ The surface defects of PA75O are fullyrecovered,and a smooth surface is obtained.When the post-annealing temperature further increases to $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ ,the primary particles of PA8o0 grow up obviously.

The effect of ball-milling and post-annealing on electrochemical performances of ASSLiBs were systematically studied.Firstly,the electrochemical performances of S750,S750-m and PA750 samples in lithium ion batteries using the liquid electrolyte were tested,as shown in Fig.S1.The initial discharge specific capacities of S750, $s { 7 } 5 0 – \mathrm { m }$ ,and PA750 samples are 151.9,162.6 and 180.1 mAh $\mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ respectively. Clearly,the initial discharge specific capacity can be improved after ball milling，and further enhanced with postannealing.Fig.6 shows the initial charge/discharge curves of all NCA samples in ASSLiBs.The details of initial charge/discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency for all samples are given in Table 2.After ball-milling,the samples $S 7 5 0 – \mathrm { m }$ showed an increase of discharge capacity,however,the initial coulombic efficiency is still poor.The decrease of particle size would increase the contact area between solid electrolytes and positive electrodes,and consequently give rise to more diffusion channels for lithium ions transfer[25].Therefore,the increase of discharge capacity could be due to the smaller particle size [26]. After post-annealing at $7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ and $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $^ { 5 \mathrm { h } }$ ,the PA700 and PA750 samples show discharge capacities of 118.9 and $1 4 5 . 8 \mathrm { \ m A h \ g } ^ { - 1 }$ ，respectively,and the corresponding initial coulombic efficiency isup to $6 8 . 5 \%$ and $7 6 . 3 \%$ higher than these reported recently[17].The lower discharge capacity and initial coulombic efficiency for PA7oO are due to incompletely recovered structure and surface defects.However, the initial coulombic efficiencyis only $5 9 . 3 \%$ when the post-annealing temperature is increased to $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } .$ The ball-milling introduces surface defects such as cracks,pores and small particles,while the post-annealing could remove damages caused by the ball-milling and result in reconstruction of the surface structure,as shown in Fig.5.Therefore,the improvement of discharge capacity for PA750 isascribed to the surface reconstruction.The effect of surface recovery has been reported for $\operatorname { L i C o O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { L i N i _ { 1 / 3 } C o _ { 1 / 3 } M n _ { 1 / 3 } O _ { 2 } }$ [27,28]. Since the particle size and surface morphology of PA750 and PA8oO samples are very similar,the deterioration of discharge capacity for PA8oo is mainly attributed to the growth of primary particles at higher temperature as well as cation mixing [20]. Clearly, $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ is the optimal temperature for post-annealing,at which the surface defects caused by ball-milling could recoverwell, and meanwhile the cation mixing is appropriate.

Fig.6 shows the impedance profiles of the all-solid-state cells at the state of second charge to $3 . 7 \mathrm { V }$ vs.Li-In alloy. The impedance profiles of all the cells consist of a semi-circle in the high-medium frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region. The intersection point with the horizontal axis in the high frequency $( 1 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } ~ \mathrm { H z } )$ was ascribed to the solid electrolyte layer impedance $R _ { \mathrm { S E } }$ The semi-circle observed in the medium-frequency region is regarded asan interfacial charge transfer resistance $( R _ { \mathrm { P E } } )$ which reflects the interfacial impendence between positive electrode and solid electrolyte interface [12,14].All the samples had the similar $R _ { \mathrm { S E } }$ value $( 6 0 - 7 0 ~ \Omega )$ since they used the same solid electrolyte.However,sample S750,S750-m,PA700,PA750,and PA800 have $R _ { \mathrm { P E } }$ values of $8 3 0 \ \Omega$ ，612 $\Omega ,$ 、423 Ω，252 Ω,and 497 $\Omega$ respectively.This indicated that the ball milling could reduce the interface resistance a little,and the ball milling together with the post-annealingat moderate temperature could effectively reduce the interface resistance.The results are consistent very well with SEM images and charge/discharge curves.From Figs.6 and 7,it could be concluded that the higher initial discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency of NCA is closely related to the decrease in the interfacial resistance.Thus,the good distributions of particles caused by ball-milling increase the contact areas between positive electrode and solid electrolyte,anda fresh reconstruction surface facilitate both fast lithium ion and electron conductions at the interface.

Inaddition to the results of cell impedance,in order to further identify the effect of the ball-milling and post-annealing on the initial discharge capacity of the all-solid-state cells,the micro

Raman spectra scattering was conducted on sample S75o,S750-m, PA700,PA75O and PA8oO to investigate the local cation environment.As shown in Fig.8,a small peak at $1 0 9 0 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 }$ is detected only on particles of sample S750,which is assigned to the symmetric stretch $( \mathrm { v } _ { 1 } ( \mathrm { A } _ { 1 } ^ { ' } ) ) \mathrm { o f } \mathrm { C O } _ { 3 } ^ { 2 - }$ in $\mathrm { L i } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 3 }$ [29],indicating that $\mathrm { L i } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 3 }$ formed during sintering.However,the formed $\mathrm { L i } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 3 }$ could be eliminated from particles surface by the ball-milling,and would not appear again after post-annealing process.The fresh surface without impurities and defects would decrease the interface impedance.The peaks located at 475 and $5 5 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ are associated with vibrations characteristic of O-Ni-O bending ${ \delta } ( 0 - { \ M } - 0 )$ $\mathtt { E _ { g } }$ mode) and $\mathsf { N i } { - } 0$ stretching ( $\mathrm { \backslash v ( N i O _ { 6 } ) }$ $\mathsf { A } _ { 1 \mathrm { g } }$ mode) [30].The peak at $4 7 5 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ is related to the order structure [31,32]，which suggests that the cation mixing results in the decrease of intensity.The intensity of peak at $4 7 5 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ decreases after ball-milling, indicating that the ballmilling process could lead to larger cation mixing.After post annealing,the strongest peak (i.e.the lowest cation mixing) is obtained at $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ Thermodynamically, the higher temperature led to the increase in cation mixing [2O].Kinetically, the atoms need thermal energy to rearrange in a limited time.Therefore,a moderate temperature $( 7 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C )$ could give the optimal property.The results prove that the decrease of discharge capacity for PA80O is related to the cation mixing.

# 4.Conclusions

The relationship between fundamental lithium storage behavior of NCA and its structure and morphology in ASSLiBs was revealed. Due to the high interfacial resistance induced by large particle size and surface impurities,the NCA positive material only calcinated at $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ showa very low discharge capacity in ASSLiBs.In this case,a ball-milling process followed by post-annealing is carried out and proved to be an efficient way to reduce NCA particle size,recover the surface defects and remove surface impurities. Combination with the XPS and Raman results,ball milling process could increase the surface defects.But $S 7 5 0 – \mathrm { m }$ still show improved electrochemical performances compared with S75o,which could be mainly ascribed to its reduced particle size.And the further improved electrochemical performance of the PA75O after the postannealing results from the weakened surface defectsand surface impurities.Therefore,the particle size distribution as well as surface defectsand impurities of the samples could be the main reason for the ameliorated electrochemical performances.The resultant NCA shows a greatly reduced interfacial resistance with $\mathrm { L i } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { G e P } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S } _ { 1 2 }$ electrolyte,which results in a significantly enhanced discharge capacity of $1 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m A h } ~ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ in the ASSLiBs.
