Two seriesof poly(ester imide)s derived from bis(trimeliticacidanhydride)phenylester(TAHQ)and bis[(3,4- dicarboxylicanhydride)phenyll terephthalate (PAHP),aswell as poly(ether imide)s based on hydroquinone diphthalic anhydride (HQDPA), were synthesized with aromatic diamines via solution polycondensation. These polyimide films were transparent with an ultraviolet-visible absorption cut-off wavelength below $3 7 5 \ \mathsf { n m }$ ,and with tensile strengths of $4 2 . 0 { - } 8 3 . 8 ~ \mathsf { M P a } .$ tensile moduli of 2.5-4.7 GPa and elongations at break of $2 . 1 \mathrm { - } 5 . 4 \%$ .Compared with the poly(ether imide)s,the poly(ester imide)s showed higher glass transition temperatures $( T _ { \mathfrak { g } } ) .$ lowerwater absorption $( W _ { \mathsf { A } } )$ and lower temperature of $5 \%$ weight loss $( T _ { \mathrm { d } 5 \% } )$ Moreover,the poly(ester imide)s derived from PAHP with a low electron afinity of $2 . 0 4 \mathrm { e V }$ by theoretical calculation achieved better transparency, lower $W _ { \mathsf { A } }$ and slightly lower $T _ { \mathfrak { g } }$ than the corresponding TAHQbased poly(ester imide)s.

# 1.Introduction

Aromatic polyimides (PIs) have been widely utilized in a variety of electric and microelectronic applications for their reliable and excellent properties,i.e.,considerably high glass transition temperatures $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \right)$ ,high resistance to chemicals,good dielectric and mechanical properties.1-5 However,the widespread applications of polyimides in optical fields are often limited because of deep coloration which is caused by the strong intra- and intermolecularcharge transfer (CT) interactions.So far,much effort has been devoted to the development of transparent polyimide films based on structural design.The most effective approach for inhibiting CT interactions is to use non-aromatic (cycloaliphatic) monomers eitherin diamines or tetracarboxylic dianhydrides.8-15Unfortunately， thisapproach somewhat sacrifices high-temperature stability.For fully aromatic polyimides,the best way is incorporation of trifluoromethyl group in the monomers， such as $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ (hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphthalicanhydride(6FDA) and $^ { 2 , 2 ^ { \prime } }$ -bis(trifluoromethyl) biphenyl- $^ { \cdot 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -diamine (TFDB),which are commercial available but expensive.16 Another strategy for obtaining transparent polyimidesistouse dianhydrides with low electronacceptability and diamines with low electron-donatability as monomers for weakening both intra- and intermolecular CT interactions.7 For example,the polyimide films derived from bis(ether anhydride)s with electron-donating atom “O” in phthalic anhydride,which decreased the electron affinity $\left( E _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ of dianhydride， showedgoodtransparency.17-25 However, poly(ether imide)s (PEIs)based on bis(ether anhydride)s decrease the $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ due to the introduction of flexible ether linkage.

On the other hand,the poly(ester imide)s (PEsIs) derived from trimellitic acid anhydride achieved higher $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ and low water absorption $\left( W _ { \mathrm { A } } \right)$ etc,which was widely used in electronic devices such as integrated circuits. $\mathbf { 2 6 - 3 1 }$ The introduction of polar ester linkage in the polymer chain,increased the intermolecular interaction,which was beneficial to improve $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ and lower water absorption,but also increased the electron affinity of dianhydride due to the electron-withdrawing $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ group directly substitutedatphthalicanhydride,which enhanced the electron-acceptability of dianhydride leading to increase the coloration of resulting polyimides at the same time.

Therefore,PEsIs derived from hydroxyl phthalic anhydride would be a best strategy to obtain combined excellent properties.The existence of ester group would remain the excellent properties of poly(ester imide)s,such as high $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ and low $W _ { \mathrm { A } } ,$ （204号 while using electron-donating atom $" \mathbf { O } ^ { \prime \prime }$ linked with phthalic anhydride woulddecrease theelectronaffinityofdianhydride to improve the transparency of films (Fig.1).To the best of our knowledge,there is no report on the isomeric effect of such linkage on the polyimides.3² Herein,two series of PEsIs were prepared from two dianhydrides with different electron affinities,bis(trimellitic acid anhydride)phenyl ester (TAHQ) andbis[(3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride) phenyl] terephthalate (PAHP)，with various aromatic diamines via solution poly condensation.The thermal stability，solubility,water absorp tion,coeffcient of thermal expansion (CTE),mechanical and optical properties of these polyimides as well as the different properties caused by the different ester linkages were well investigated. The polyimides derived from hydroquinone diphthalic anhydride (HQDPA) were also prepared and investigated for comparison.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded with a Thermo Nicolet 67oo FT-IR spectrometer.Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were performed on a Bruker 400 AVANCE III spectrometer operating at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { M H z } }$ for $\mathrm { ^ 1 H }$ NMR using dimethyl sulfoxide- $\cdot d _ { 6 }$ $_ { 6 } \left( \mathrm { D M S O } { - } d _ { 6 } \right)$ as solvent.The inherent viscosities of the polymers were measured at $3 0 \pm 0 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with an Ubbelohde viscometer and the concentration was $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { g } \mathrm { d L } ^ { - 1 }$ in DMAc.Differential scanning calorimetry (DsC) measurements of the polyimides were performed on a Mettler Toledo-DsC Iat a heating rate of $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ under nitrogen atmosphere,and the temperature at the middle of the thermal transition from the second heating scan was assigned as the glass transition temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \right)$ ． The melting points (mp) of synthesized monomers were also measured by the DsC instrument at äa heating rate of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \ : \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ and the melting points were determined from the temperature at the maximum point of the corresponding enthalpy peaks. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the polyimides were performed on a Mettler ToledoTGA/DSC I instrument to evaluate the thermal stability of the polyimidesataheating rate of $1 0 ^ { \circ } { \bf C } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ from $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under nitrogen or air atmosphere (flow rate of $5 0 \ \mathrm { m L } \ \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ ！ The mechanical properties of the polyimide films such as tensile modulus,tensile strength,and elongationat break were measured and averaged on at least five film specimens by an Instron model 5567 tensile tester at a crosshead speed of $5 \mathrm { m m }$ $\operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ at room temperature. The specimen gauge lengths were $5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ and the specimen widths were $1 0 \mathrm { m m }$ .Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the polymer flms were recorded on a Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurement of the polyimide films was undertaken ona Bruker D8 Advance with $\mathrm { C u } \ \mathrm { K } \alpha$ radiation （20 $( 4 0 \mathrm { k V } , 4 0 \mathrm { m A } )$ at a scanning rate of $5 ^ { \circ } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ from 5 to $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ . The equilibrium water absorption $\left( W _ { \mathrm { A } } \right)$ was determined by the weighing of the changes in vacuum-dried film specimens before andafter immersion in deionized water at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .The water absorption was calculated from the following equation:

# Water absorption $( \% ) = [ ( W _ { \mathrm { w e t } } - W _ { \mathrm { d r y } } ) / W _ { \mathrm { d r y } } ] \times 1 0 0 \%$

where $W _ { \mathrm { d r y } }$ is the initialweight of the dry film and $W _ { \mathrm { w e t } }$ is the weight of the film after immersion in deionized water.The waterabsorption of the PIs is the mean data of three parallel samples.Thermo mechanical analysis (TMA) was performed by aMETTLER TMA/SDTA841ataheating rate of $1 0 ^ { \circ } { \bf C } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ .The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was recorded at the temperature range of $1 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ：

2.3.5Polymer synthesis and flm preparation.Utilizing TAHQ,PAHP and HQDPA as dianhydride monomers,six kinds of polyimides were synthesized by polycondensation with diamine monomer $m$ -BAPS and 6F-BAPS via two-step procedure with different methods (thermal imidization $\mathbf { \Pi } ( \mathbf { H } )$ and chemical imidization (C)),respectively.The resulting PIs were referred to asPI-1a to PI-3b successively.

The synthesis of the flm of polyimide (PI-2a) is used below as an example to illustrate the general synthetic route for the preparation: dianhydride PAHP $\left( 1 . 8 3 3 4 \mathrm { g } , 4 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ was added in one portion to a solution of diamine $m$ -BAPS $\mathrm { 1 . 7 3 0 0 ~ g } ,$ $4 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l } \$ ）inDMAc(14.2536g) in a $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ flask.The mixture was stirred in nitrogen at room temperature for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to yield a viscous poly(amic acid) (PAA) solution with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { \ u r t { \% } }$ solid concentration.Then the resulting viscous poly(amic acid) solutionwasdiluted to $1 5 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ withadditionalDMAc.

For the thermal imidization procedure,the PAA solution was taken out and cast onto a glass plate.The glass plate was placed in an oven at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to remove most of the solvent. The semidried PAA film was further dried and imidized by heating at 150 and $2 6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $6 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at each temperature.The resulting films PI-2a-H were obtained by immersion the glass plate in water followed by dry inan oven at $1 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ：

For the chemical imidization procedure,the PAA solution was added the mixture solution of acetic anhydride (2 mL) and pyridine (1 mL).After stirring for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ ,the solution was diluted withDMAc and slowly poured into a vigorously stirred ethanol. The precipitate was collected by filtration,washed thoroughly with hot ethanol and dried.The polyimide film PI-2a-C was prepared via the casting of $1 0 \ \mathrm { w t \% }$ homogenous solution of above polyimide powder in DMAc onto a clean glass plate, which was then placed in an oven at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ overnight to evapo rate most of the solvent and subjected to scheduled heating at 150 and $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ateach temperature.

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1.Monomer synthesis

Asshown in Scheme 1，4-hydroxyphthalic anhydride was obtained by substitution reaction with 4-nitrophthalonitrile, alkaline hydrolysis in the presence of KOH,and then sublima tion under the vacuum.The bis(ester anhydride)，bis[(3,4- dicarboxylicanhydride)phenyl]terephthalate(PAHP)，was afforded through esterification reaction of terephthaloyl chloride with 4-hydroxyphthalic anhydride.Fig.2 shows the IR spectrum of the bis(ester anhydride） PAHP. The strong absorption bands around 1846 $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $( \nu _ { a s y m } \mathrm { c = } 0 )$ and $1 7 8 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $\stackrel { \prime } { \underset { . } { \nu } _ { s y m } } \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O } )$ were assigned to the phthalic anhydride, while the strong absorption bands around $1 7 3 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was assigned to the ester group in PAHP.The observed bands in the region of $1 0 0 0 { - } 1 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ were due to the $\mathbf { C } { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { O }$ stretching.The ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR spectrum of PAHP is shown in Fig.3,in which all the signals were assigned.The aromatic protons in terephthalate $\left( \mathrm { H } _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ and phthalic anhydride $\left( \mathrm { H } _ { \mathrm { b } } – \mathrm { H } _ { \mathrm { d } } \right)$ resonated in the region of 8.40 and 8.23-8.01 ppm,respectively.

# 3.2.Synthesis of polyimides

Utilizing bis(trimellitic acid anhydride) phenyl ester (TAHQ), bis[(3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride)phenyl] terephthalate (PAHP) and hydroquinone diphthalic anhydride (HQDPA) as dianhy dride monomers,six kinds of polyimides were synthesized by polycondensation with diamine monomer $m$ -BAPSand 6F-BAPS via two-step procedure,which is shown in Scheme 2.Whenever aromatic diamines were used, the reaction smoothly proceeded and led to homogeneous after 24 hours.The inherent viscosities of prepared poly(amic acid)s (PAAs) were between $0 . 5 7 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0 2$ dL ${ \mathrm { g } } ^ { - 1 }$ in DMAc at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ (Table1).The polyimide flms derived from TAHQ and HQDPA were successfully afforded by thermal imidization.To our surprise,no flexible polyimide films based on PAHP were obtained by thermal imidization,although the PAAs had higher inherent viscosities with $0 . 8 7 – 1 . 0 2 \ \AA$ dL $\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ which indicated that PAAs were degraded quickly during the thermal imidization conditions.Fortunately,all the polyimides were highly soluble in DMAc at room temperature,so that polymerization were conducted by chemical imidization (C) and the resulting polyimides could be cast to form flexible films.

The chemical structures of polyimides were confirmed by $^ 1 \mathrm { H }$ NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. The representative ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR spectra of PI-1b-C,PI-2b-C and PI-3b-C are shown in Fig. 4-6, respectively,inwhich all the signals have been assigned to the protons of the repeating unit.The aromatic protons $\left( \mathrm { H } _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ in the middle benzene of dianhydride moiety in PI-1b-C,PI-2b-C and PI-3b-C were resonated in 7.55, 8.41 and $7 . 3 3 \mathrm { p p m }$ ,respectively. Furthermore, the COSY spectra ofPI-1b-C,PI-2b-C and PI-3b-C (see figures in $\mathrm { E S I } \dagger$ )were measured for the further assignments of protons.The completed imidization was confirmed by the absence of corresponding amide signals and carboxylic acid functions.

The typical IR spectra of PI-1b-C,PI-2b-C and PI-3b-C are shown in Fig.7.The strong absorption bands around $1 7 8 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $\left( \nu _ { a s y m } { \bf C } { = } { \bf O } \right)$ ， $1 7 2 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ 1 $\stackrel { \cdot } { \underbrace { \boldsymbol { \nu } _ { s y m } \mathbf { C } } } = \mathbf { O } )$ ,and $1 3 7 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ 0 $\operatorname { \dot { \rho } } _ { \mathbf { C } - \mathbf { N } }$ imide) were assigned to the phthalimide unit,while the absorption bond around 1316 and $1 1 4 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ were assigned to the sulfone unit.

The $T _ { \mathrm { g } ^ { \mathrm { S } } }$ of polyimides were in the range of $2 1 1 - 2 5 0 \ { ^ \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ， $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ is correlated with the structure of polymer chain.PI-1a-C,PI-2a-C and PI-3a-C derived from $m$ BAPS displayed a relatively lower $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ than the other PIs derived from 6F-BAPS due to their more flexible backboneswith meta substitution.PI-1b-C showed the highest $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ value of $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ because of the increase of chain rigidity with para substitution and steric effect of the trifluoromethyl group.3² The $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ values of the TAHQ and PAHP series of polyimides were higher than those of the corresponding counterparts of HQDPA-based PIs.What's more,the PIs derived with PAHP exhibited slightly lower $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ compared with TAHQ-based polyimides,which indicated that intermolecular interactions were weak due to the different ester linkages.

The thermal stability of the polyimides was evaluated by dynamic TGA conducted ata heating rate of $1 0 \ ^ { \circ } { \bf C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ . The temperature of $5 \%$ weight loss $\left( T _ { \mathrm { d 5 \% } } \right)$ in nitrogen and air atmospheres were determined from original TGA thermograms, which are listed in the Table1 and the TGA curves ofPI-1a-C to PI-3b-C are shown in Fig.8. The $T _ { \mathrm { d 5 \% } }$ values of these PIs were recorded in the range of $4 8 1 - 5 5 6 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ in nitrogen and $4 5 1 - 5 4 2 \ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ in air. It was obvious that poly(ester imide)s showed lower $T _ { \mathrm { d 5 \% } }$ than the poly(ether imide)s,because the ester groups started to

The CTE values of poly(ester imide)s and poly(ether imide)s are also summarized in Table 1,which were in the range of $5 2 . 7 \mathrm { - } 7 5 . 3 \ \mathrm { p p m \ K ^ { - 1 } }$ and $6 1 . 0 { - } 1 2 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { p p m } \ \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively.

# 3.4.Water absorption

Assummarized in Table1,all the PI films showedlow water absorption in the range of $0 . 2 8 \substack { - 0 . 6 2 \% }$ ,which were much lower than commercially available Kapton-H film $\mathbf { \widetilde { P M D A } } / 4 \mathbf { , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -ODA) with $W _ { \mathbf { A } }$ of $2 . 9 \%$ .13 The results are probably related to a significant decrease in the content of highly polarizing imide groups in the structures.14,29 Moreover， the PIs based on 6F-BAPS showed lower water absorption than the PIs based on $m$ -BAPS. This phenomenon was probably due to the trifluoromethyl groups,which induced greater water proofing effect.13 Furthermore,the PAHP-based PIs exhibited lower $W _ { \mathbf { A } }$ than the corresponding TAHQ-based PIs.The low water absorption ensured their applications in the microelectronic industry.

# 3.5. Solubility

The solubility of the polyimides was tested qualitatively in various organic solvents,and the results are shown in Table 2. The solubilityofPI-1b-C,PI-2b-CandPI-3b-CisbetterthanPI1a-C,PI-2a-C and PI-3a-C owing to $\mathbf { C F } _ { 3 }$ group which inhibited close packing and reduced the inter-chain interaction to enhance solubility.Inalmostall cases,the PEsIs based on the $m$ -BAPS exhibited better solubility than the PEIs,while the 6F-BAPS-containing PEsIs showed worse solubility than the corresponding PEIs.Furthermore,the PIs derived from PAHP exhibited slightly better solubility compared with TAHQ-based polyimides.

# 3.6.Mechanical properties

The mechanical properties of the flexible polyimide films are listed in Table 3.The polyimide films exhibited good mechanical properties with tensile strengths of $4 2 { - } 8 4 \ \mathrm { \ M P a }$ ，tensile moduli of $2 . 5 { - } 4 . 7 ~ \mathrm { G P a }$ ,and elongations at break of $2 . 1 { - } 5 . 4 \%$ Among these polyimide films,the tensile strength and tensile modulus of PI-1b-C was more than $8 3 ~ \mathrm { \ m p a }$ and $2 . 8 \mathrm { G P a } ,$ respectively，which were attributed to rigid structure in the polymers backbone.What's more，the TAHQ-based PEsIs showed slightly better mechanical properties than the PAHPbased PEsIs.

# 3.7．X-ray diffraction

The crystallinity of the polyimide filmswas analyzed bywide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). PI-2a-C exhibitedsome diffraction peaks in the $2 \theta$ range from 15 and $3 0 ^ { \circ }$ ，which suggested that polyimide had relatively some regularity of intermolecular packing or short-range-order structure.The WAXD patterns of the other films were broad without obvious peak features,which indicated that they were all amorphous (Fig. 9).

# 3.8．Optical properties

The Uv-visible absorption spectra of some representative poly imide flms are illustrated in Fig.10,while the transmittance spectra and absorption coefficient curves are showed in Fig. S7 and S8 (see figures in $\mathbf { E S I \dagger }$ ).Thecut-offwavelength (absorption edge, $\lambda _ { 0 } )$ ,transmittance at 40o,450, $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and absorption coefficient at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ from these spectra are listed in Table 4.

All polyimide films exhibited cut-off wavelengths shorter than $3 7 5 \mathrm { n m }$ and were highly transparent.The lower coloration of the polyimide derived from 6F-BAPS with the bulky and electron-withdrawing $\mathbf { C F } _ { 3 }$ groups in their diamine moieties could be explained by the decreased CTC formation of polymer chains through higher steric hindrance and lower inductive effect.A secondary positive effect of the $\mathrm { C F } _ { 3 }$ groups on the film transparency was the weakened intermolecular dispersion forces due to low polarizability of the $\mathbf { C } { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { F }$ bond.18

Asexpected,the PAHP-based PIs exhibited better optical properties than TAHQ-based PIs due to the lower electron affinity $\left( E _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ value of PAHP,which reduced the CTC effect formation.What's more,the PAHP-based PIs even showed lower cut-offwavelength and higher transmittance at $4 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ than the HQDPA-based polyimides,although HQDPA-based polyimides showed better transparency after $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \ n m }$ .(Fig.11）The absorption coefficients of the polyimides at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ excluding the film thickness factor were also supported these results. On the other hand,the HQDPA based polyimide films revealed slightly better transparentin the visible wavelength spectrum of $4 0 0 { - } 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ than their respective analogue based on the TAHQ andPAHP,among which the PI-3b-C showed the best optical transparency,probably due to the ether moiety in the dianhy dride weakened both intra-and intermolecular charge transfer interactions by decreasing electron-acceptability of dianhydride.'Furthermore,the polyimide films prepared via chemical imidization (C) tend to show higher $T _ { 4 0 0 }$ values than the corresponding thermallyimidized $\mathbf { \Pi } ( \mathbf { H } )$ films.This was probably due to an end-capping reaction of the thermally less stable terminal amino groups with $\mathbf { A c } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ during chemical imidization.13

To interpret the coloration of polyimide films clearly, the electron affinities $( E _ { \mathrm { a } } ) ^ { 3 4 }$ of TAHQ,PAHP as well as HQDPA, were carried out by a theoretical calculation employing the DFT method in the Gaussian O9 package.35 The exchange correlation functional B3LYP is carefully mixed with Hartree-Fock exchange calculated with Kohn-Sham orbits and the B88 exchange functional plus the LYP correlation functional.6 The all-electron basis set $6 { - } 3 1 ~ \mathrm { g }$ (d) was used to describe the C, O andHatoms.The calculation results for thevalues of $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ of the dianhydrideswere calculated from eqn (1) and the resultsare tabulated in Table 5.As expected,the $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ values of PAHP is $ { 2 . 0 4 } \ \mathrm { e V }$ ,whichismuchlower than thatof TAHQwith value of $2 . 1 7 \ \mathrm { e V }$ ，indicates that the ester group decrease the electron acceptability of dianhydride， therefore，the corresponding polyimides based on PAHP exhibit a relatively better transparency than that of TAHQ.And the PIsderived from HQDPA show the best transparency due to the lowest $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ value of $1 . 6 2 \mathrm { e V }$

# 4. Conclusion

Two series of novel poly(ester imide)s were synthesized from bis(trimellitic acid anhydride) phenyl ester (TAHQ)，bis[(3,4- dicarboxylic anhydride) phenyl] terephthalate (PAHP）and hydroquinone diphthalic anhydride (HQDPA)with various aromatic diamines by polycondensation，which could be formed transparent,flexible,and tough flms with tensile strengths of $4 2 . 0 { - } 8 3 . 8 ~ \mathrm { M P a }$ ,tensile moduli of 2.5-4.7 GPa and elongations at break of $2 . 1 { - } 5 . 4 \%$ .The polyimide films from PAHP showed better transparency,lower $W _ { \mathrm { { A } } }$ and slightly lower $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ compared with TAHQ-based polyimides.The optical properties of these polyimide films are well coincident with the electron affinities $\left( E _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ values by theoretical calculation.This proves that poly(ester imide)s derived from PAHP area successful method for improving transparency and remaining properties of poly(ester imide)s.
