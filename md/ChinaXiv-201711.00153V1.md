# 1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide according to the WHO,and the incidence of most cancers including gastric cancer,liver cancer and esophageal cancer in our country has kept gradually increasing over the past 2O years from 1989 to $2 0 0 8 ^ { [ 1 ] }$ . Despite the availability of a large number of chemotherapeutic drugs, the medical need remains stillargely unmet because of drawbacks of the antineoplastic agents,such as drug resistance, the lack of selectivity and cancer metastasis[2l.

Natural products are an important original source of many widely used anti-cancer drugsl3]. As one of the widespread class of natural organic compounds occurring in plants,animals and fungi, steroid family has exhibited potent antitumor effects through direct suppression of tumor growth, including reduced cell cycle progression and apoptosis,or inhibiting tumor metastasis[4,5l,and numerous steroidal derivatives have been discovered with potent antineoplastic activity and high tissue selectivityl6].Cytotoxic steroids like estramustine phosphate,a hybrid structure of estradiol and nitrogen mustard combined through a carbamate linkage with alkylating capability and estrogen-induced specificity,is marketed as a chemotherapy agent for the treatment of prostate cancerl7,8]， which could also be used as a single chemotherapeutic agent or along with other agents such as $5 a$ -reductase inhibitors[9]. Due to the pivotal role of antineoplastic nitrogenous steroids,the present review will discuss the recent cases for the structural modification on the cyclic backbone (Fig.1) and corresponding SAR for these steroidal derivatives as anticancer agents.

# 2. 1 Modification on the A-ring

Poirier's group reported the preparation of five libraries of $2 \beta$ -piperazino- $5 a$ -androstane- $\cdot 3 a , 1 7 \beta$ -diol derivatives by parallel solid-phase synthesis in 2O1l[0],and biological evaluation against HL-6O leukemia cells found these aminosteroids revealed interesting SAR.For example,the amide coupling functionality showed stronger cytotoxic activity compared to the corresponding sulfonamides or benzylamines,and six of the most active amide derivatives (Fig. 2, $\mathbf { 1 } \sim \mathbf { 6 } )$ ）were obtained with low half-maximal inhibitory concentration $\left( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } \right)$ values of $1 . 7 { \sim } 3 . 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ and high selectivity indices of ${ 5 } { \sim } 5 5$ . In 2012,amino-pregnane derivatives $( \mathbf { 7 } \sim \mathbf { 9 } )$ were further prepared by using a sequence of liquid and solid-phase reactions to extend the previous SAR data on anti-eukemic activities[1l, and derivative 9 substituted by the 3-acetylbenzoyl group exhibits strong anti-proliferation effect against HL-6O leukemia cells $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }                        : ~ 1 . 9 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ ）and low toxicity on normal peripheral blood lymphocytes $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } ; 3 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ .Then,a $5 a$ -androstane- $\cdot 3 \alpha , 1 7 \beta$ diol derivative with a quinoline nucleus at the end of the piperazine-proline side-chain at position $2 \beta$ and an ethinyl at position $1 7 a$ （20 (10)[12,13] showed the most potent cytotoxic activity against five cancer cellines studied $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } \colon 0 . 1 \sim 1 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { M }$ （204号 for HL-60, MCF-7, T-47D,LNCaP and WEHI-3,respectively),and selectivity experiment towards liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 indicated the aminosteroid possessed a very low risk of drug-drug interactions.In order to increase the in vivo drug potency,an optimized 3-dimethylcarbamate aminosteroid derivative (11） was finally synthesized in 2O16 according to the pro-drug strategy targeting on the $3 a$ -hydroxyl group[14],and the lead compound are more selective for cancer cels over normal cels and much more stable in liver microsomes.

To develop more effective steroidal drugs, we synthesizedalibrary of (25R)-2-[(1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy]-spirostan-1,4,6-triene-3-onesfromdiosgeninforanti-tumor screening,and three steroidal triazoles (Fig. 3, ${ \bf 1 2 } \sim { \bf 1 4 }$ ） possessed potent anti-proliferative effects against Caski cells with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of $9 . 4 { \sim } 1 1 . 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } ^ { [ 1 5 ] }$ . The structure/cytotoxicity investigations implied that the benzyl, 2-oxopropyl or 3-hydroxyphenylethyl substituted steroidal triazoles exhibited excellent anti-tumor activities.

Krstic[l6] reported thesynthesisand anticancer activity ofmono-/bis-thiosemicarbazonesand mono-/bis-thiadiazolines substituted steroid at the C-3 position，and the best cytotoxic products were 3-thiosemicarbazones (Fig. 4, $\mathbf { 1 5 } { \sim } \mathbf { 1 7 } )$ ） and 3,17-bis(thiadiazolines) (18,19) against six cancer cell lines (HeLa, K562, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, LS174 and A549), which were comparable to cisplatin. The spiro heterocyclic substituent at the C-17 position，as well as the presence of an $\mathbf { \alpha } _ { \alpha , \beta }$ -unsaturated thiosemicarbazone moiety at C-3, enhanced the activity of the tested compounds.

Bufadienolides are a type of natural cardiac steroids with potent antitumor activities from the Traditional Chinese medicine Chan'Su. In order to improve their biological activity and water solubility,Hu’s group[17] designed and synthesized the bufalin 3-nitrogen-containing-ester derivatives in 2Ol3,and found the C3 moiety of A-ring had important influence on the cytotoxic activity in SAR study. The bufalin-3-piperidinyl-4-carboxylate (Fig. 5, 21） displayed a significant cytotoxic potency compared to the parent compound bufalin with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of 0.76 and $0 . 3 4 \mathrm { \ n M }$ against HeLa and A549 cell lines, respectively. Several years later,they found bufalin-3-yl nitrogen-containing-carbamate hydrochloride (22, $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } { : 0 . 3 0 }$ to $1 . 0 9 \mathrm { n M }$ against ten tested tumor cell lines） and ${ \bf C 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -substituted oleandrin analogues (23 and 24, IC50: 10.9 to $2 1 . 7 \ \mathrm { \ n M }$ against human cervical carcinoma cell line） exhibited significant in vitro anti-proliferative activities[18,19].

To clarify the SAR of anti-tumor activity of diosgenin derivatives in vitro,Fan's group[20,21 designed and synthesized 3-azole bromides substituted diosgenin derivatives (Fig. 6, $2 5 \sim 3 0 \$ ）based on the three-dimensional pharmacophore docking simulation for Bcl-2 inhibitors,and SAR results indicated that those with larger hydrophobic heterocyclic group have better activity through the mechanism of hydrogen bonding interaction and dipole-dipole interaction. Due to the restriction of molecular length,the side chain of compound 30 could not occupy the P2 and D3 sites compared with other derivatives,which therefore resulted in the poor antitumor activity.

Duan's group firstly prepared E-salignone (Fig.7, 31)[22l by eight steps of reactions in $1 6 . 3 \%$ total yields, and found it could inhibit the invasion of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and non-smallcell lung cancer cells (A549) induced by the chemokine epidermal growth factor (EGF) with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of 0.36 and $5 . 7 7 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ ,respectively. After modification, a series of antimetastatic E-salignone amide derivatives $( 3 2 { \sim } 3 4 )$ （20 were synthesized[23l,and compound 32 was found to possess anti-migration effects in wound-healing assay. Recently, they have further prepared pregn-17(2O)-en-3-amine derivatives $( 3 5 \sim 4 2 )$ as anti-breast cancer agents[24]. Compared with the positive control LY294002 $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } \colon 0 . 3 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ ， the most potent anti-metastatic compound 40 exhibited $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ of $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value through the mechanism of inhibiting the phosphorylations of integrin $\beta 1$ ， PI3K，Akt and PKCζ.Preliminary SAR indicated $3 \beta$ -substituted steroid derivatives exhibited better anti-invasion activities than the $3 a$ -substituted ones,and the $\mathbf { \alpha } _ { \alpha , \beta }$ -unsaturated fragment in ring D might be critical for their anti-metastatic activities.

Apart from the above acyclic chain nitrogen-containing derivatives on the A-ring of steroid skeleton, some heterocycle fused steroids were also reported as anticancer agents. Cephalostatin 1 (Fig.8,43)[25l，a remarkably cytotoxic bis-steroidal pyrazine isolated from the marine tube worm Cephalodiscus gilchristi,has become an important target for total syntheses and structural modification model for the drug discovery. Tian's lab illustrated an eficient and practical synthesis of 43 using natural tetraol and lactone instead of the traditional prognenolone or epiandrostenone[26].Petit[27] simplified its E and $\mathrm { \Delta F }$ rings by the replacement at C-17 with $ { \alpha }$ -pyrone or dihydro-y-pyrone, and two bis-steroidal pyrazine pyrones (44, 45) were synthesized in 8 steps and found to have moderate anti-proliferative activities in the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cancer cell line with corresponding $50 \%$ effective dose $\mathrm { ( E D _ { 5 0 } ) }$ of $2 5 \sim 5 7 \mu \mathrm { M }$

# 2.2 Modification on the B-ring

Due to the unique [6-6-6-5]-fused rings system,steroidal compounds display diverse biological activity and play a very important role in life,and a variety of steroidal drugs with unusual and interesting structures have been reported. With respect to the modification on steroid B-ring as anticancer agents,there are not many reported literatures.

Cui et al. prepared several series of substituted $5 ( 6 {  } 7 )$ abeo-sterols (Fig. 9, 46, 47)[28] and $5 ( 6 {  } 7 )$ （204 abeo-cholesterol derivatives $( 4 8 \sim 5 1 ) ^ { [ 2 9 ] }$ ,and investigated their anti-proliferative activity against some cancer cells. SAR studies indicated the presence of a cholesterol-type side chain was essential for the cytotoxicity, especially when a thiosemicarbazone group substituted at the C-6 position. Although the elimination of 5-hydroxyl has no obvious efect on their cytotoxic function,the removal of hydroxyl at the C-3 position decreased markedly the anti-proliferative activity of the compounds.The most potent analogue 48 exhibited excellent cytotoxic activities with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $4 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ against Bel-7404 cells (compared with cisplatin, $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ ： $2 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } ,$ ). The steroid $N$ -methylthiazole derivatives (52, 53） showed distinct anti-proliferative activity against A549 and HEPG2 cells，while the $N .$ phenylthiazole substituted compounds (54, 55） displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against HeLa cels and were almost inactive to HEK293T cels[30]. They also studied the activity of steroidal semicarbazones $( { \pmb 5 6 } \sim { \pmb 5 8 } )$ and thiosemicarbazones (59)[31l and hydrazones, and found these compounds exhibited significant inhibitory activity against Bel-7404 cels with corresponding $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of $4 . 2 \sim 1 5 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ (cisplatin, $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } \colon 1 1 . 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ . The steroidal $O$ -benzyloxime ether with 6-thiosemicarbazone (60)[32] displayed an excellnt anti-proliferative activity against CNE-2 cancer cells owning an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $5 . 7 \mu \mathrm { M }$ 号

Steroidal 5,6-fused benzothiazines (Fig. 10, ${ \bf 6 1 } \sim { \bf 6 3 }$ ） were also reported by Shamsuzzaman as cancer chemotherapeutic agents[3,34] from cholest-5-en-7-one derivatives in high yield, and their molecular docking studies with DNA duplex of sequence d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 dodecamer (PDB ID:1BNA) indicated the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nucleotide base pairs and the amino group in the compounds were the main contribution for the high activity.

# 2.3Modification on the C-ring

The introduction of nitrogen atom in steroidal molecule by a heteroatom affects the chemical properties and often resulted in the alteration of its biological activities,such as lowering the acute toxicity,enhancing the inhibition of enzyme,or improving the antitumour activityl35,36].

Hanson used different lengths of triazole linker to connect $1 1 \beta$ -(4-substituted oxyphenyl)estradiols and geldanamycin component,and found the final antiestrogen-geldanamycin conjugates (Fig.11, 64, 65)[37] retained significant anti-proliferative activity against two breast cancer cell lines with respective $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values below $1 0 2 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ .These results indicated further modifications in both ER-targeting strategies and linking groups were needed in order to achieve greater potency and selectivity in therapeutic drug delivery.

Metapristone (Fig.12,67) was the major active metabolite of mifepristone (66),which was confirmed by Shao and co-workers[38l as a good cancer metastatic chemopreventive agent with modest cytostatic effects including cell cycle arest, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis on human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells. The computational docking provided the evidence that the two drugs exert their pharmacological effects with key hydrogen-bonding contacts in the same active center of hydrophobic binding cavity composed by Gln570, Arg611 and Gln642. The $N .$ -demethylation condition for large-scale preparation of 66 was improved in a significantly higher yield $( 9 7 \% )$ by using suitable base LiOAc according to Chen's method[39],and gram scale of the product could be synthesized for its further clinical trials.

Most breast cancers are initially hormone-dependent diseases，so structural modifications of steroidal hormones also lead to steroidal inhibitors targeting on aromatase or steroid sulfatase for the treatment of estrogen-dependent $\left( \mathrm { E R + } \right)$ breast cancers[40l. Mernyakl41 found D-secooximes in the $1 3 \beta .$ and $1 3 a$ -estrones (Fig. 13, ${ \bf 6 8 } \sim \mathbf { 7 0 }$ ） displayed high in vitro anti-proliferative potential against a number of cancer cell lines, with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values in a low submicromolar range. Recently, several $p$ -alkylbenzyl-substituted triazoles in the $1 3 \beta$ and $1 3 a$ -D-secoestrone series $( 7 1 \sim 7 4 ) ^ { [ 4 2 ] }$ have been synthesized and found to selectively exert high cytostatic action against A2780 cells with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of $1 ~ \mu \mathbf { M }$ ，and these secosteroid triazoles could effectively suppress the estrone to $1 7 \beta$ -estradiol conversion with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values in low micromolar range through inhibiting the activity of human $1 7 \beta$ -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1.

# 2.4Modification on the D-ring

The investigation on the SAR of D-ring modification on steroidal skeleton was also attractive for medicinal chemists. Being lack of proper directing groups,the substitution (e.g.,the introduction of an azido group) on steroidal D-ring was always proved to be more difficult[43].

Zupko and co-workers[44 reported the stereo-selective synthesis of $1 5 \beta .$ -triazolyl- $. 5 a$ -androstanes (Fig. 14, ${ \mathbf 7 5 } \sim { \mathbf 7 8 } )$ from $1 a$ -azidoandrostanes, which showed noteworthy in vitro cytostatic effects against HeLa, MCF 7 and A431 cell lines with corresponding $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of $1 . 6 9 { \sim } 8 . 4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ .Yu's group[45] synthesized the steroidal spiro-pyrrolidinyl oxindoles（79, 80） with good anti-proliferative activities $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } \colon 0 . 7 1 { \sim } 4 . 3 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ against SMMC-7721 and MCF-7,respectively)，which exerted anticancer mechanism by inducing celular early apoptosis and arresting cel cycle at G2/M phase in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.

The trans-16-triazolyl- $1 3 a$ -methyl-17-estradiol derivatives (Fig. 15, ${ \bf 8 1 } \sim { \bf 8 4 }$ ）werepreparedbyMernyakin $2 0 1 5 ^ { [ 4 6 , 4 7 ] }$ ,and the SAR for stereo-configurations of various substituent at C-16 and C-17 of steroidal was also studied. The $1 6 \beta , 1 7 a$ isomers are generally proved to be potent on all the cancer cell lines tested, which are usually substituted by $p$ -alkyl substituents on the triazolyl-phenyl and displayed outstanding activities.

With the aim of studying the SAR of novel dehydroepiandrosterone derivatives containing triazole or pyrazole rings at C-17, Cabeza[48] prepared these heterocycles substituted steroid (Fig. 16, ${ \bf 8 5 } \sim { \bf 8 7 }$ by multi-step organic reaction in high yields. Biological evaluation indicated the triazole ring derived at C-17 of steroid showed much higher cytotoxic activity as compared to a pyrazole substituted at the same position, which might be attributed to higher number of hydrogen bond acceptors of nitrogen atoms in triazole systems. After that,Banday reported a series of novel D-ring substituted isoxazoline and oxazoline derivatives of dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone $( \mathbf { 8 8 } \sim \mathbf { 9 1 } ) ^ { [ 4 9 ] }$ as potential anti-prostate cancer agents. He and co-workers[50] also designed and synthesized 17- $^ { 2 ^ { \prime } , 5 ^ { \prime } }$ -disubstituted-oxazolyl)-androsta-4,16-dien-3-one derivatives via the gold-catalyzed steroidal alkyne oxidation from 4-androstene-3,17-dione $( \mathbf { 9 2 } { \sim } \mathbf { 9 5 } )$ ，and most of them exhibited potent antitumor activities with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of $3 . 0 { \sim } 2 5 . 5 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / L }$ against MCF-7 cell line. To further study the SAR of steroidal pyrazole analogs, Shi and co-workers[51] modified $^ { 1 7 \beta }$ -pyrazolyl steroid derivatives through a concise way from pregnenolone. Compound 96 exhibited excellnt cytotoxicity against A549 with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $0 . 9 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ ,which implied 4-chlorophenyl and NH groups were important for better anti-proliferative effects.

In order to study the anticancer effect of the D-ring fused steroidal heterocycles,several pyridazino-, pyrimido-, quinazolo-, oxirano- and thiazolo-steroid derivatives were synthesized in Elmegeed's group[52l. Both acetonitrilothiazolyl androstane derivative (Fig.17,97） and its copper complex (98) exhibited more inhibitory influence on the MCF-7 growth than the reference drug doxorubicin (Dox) after $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ incubation. Liu and coworkers[53]also prepared a seriesof steroidal[17,16-d]thiazole，steroidal[1,2-blpyridine and steroidal[17,16-d]thiazole[2,1-blimidazo products through a convenient and productive method,and found imine-substituted steroidal[17,16-d]thiazole (99) had a potent cytotoxicity against MGC-803 with the $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $3 . 7 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ .The majority of amino-substituted steroidal[17,16-d]thiazole showed relatively better activity against the three cellines,and the most highly active compound was 10o which strongly inhibited the proliferation of EC1O9 cells with the $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value to be $0 . 1 9 6 \mu \mathrm { M }$

# 2.5 Other modifications

E/F-Spiroacetal ring modified steroids were identified as a useful template for the design of antitumor agents and a challenging subject for the development of novel synthetic methodologies.In 2O14,Negi[54] reported the synthesis of furostane derivatives from diosgenin through opening the F-spiroacetal ring by using sodium cyanoborohydride in AcOH at room temperature,and the final steroidal aldoxime (Fig.18,101) and oxime acetate (102） derivatives could strongly inhibit the proliferation of five cancer cell lines like tamoxifen. Wang's group[55] synthesized a range of aza-sapogenin derivatives by a facile synthetic route from natural sarsasapogenin,and the pharmacological results showed that most of the products displayed excellent selective cytotoxicity toward the cancer cell lines.Compared with the activities from a bromo or morpholinyl substituent at the C-3 and C-26 positions of sapogenin,the C-3/C-26 amino derivatives generated much better cytotoxic effects,and compound 103 $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } \colon 0 . 5 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ against A375-S2 cells; $0 . 7 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ against HT1080 cells) and 104 $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } ; 1 . 7 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$ against A549 cells) exhibited significantly cytotoxic activity.

Fig.18. Chemical structures of compounds $\mathbf { 1 0 1 } { \sim } \mathbf { 1 0 4 }$

Using diosgenin as the starting material, Fan's group[20,21l also designed to synthesize a series of cytotoxic F-spiroacetal ring-opening products substituted by imidazole hydrobromide (Fig. 19, $\mathbf { 1 0 5 } { \sim } \mathbf { 1 0 8 } ,$ with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of $2 . 9 9 \sim 8 . 9 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ against K562 or A549 cells. After further modification,A- and F-ring opening steroid (109)[56] was found to possess similar pharmacological activity with Taxol, which indicated introducing more bulky hydrophilic groups on A- and D-rings might be beneficial for antitumor effect.

Barrera's group[57l synthesized two pregnane derivatives with a triazole (Fig. 20,110) or imidazole (l1) moieties at the C-21 position using commercial 16-dehydropregnenolone acetate as starting materials,and the two compounds could inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer (PC-3),breast cancer (MCF7）and lung cancer (SK-LU-1） cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Ill had an antagonist effect upon progesterone receptor and discarded completely the androgen receptor or vitamin D receptor pathways as possible action mechanism upon anti-proliferative process,suggesting the modification of steroidal structure by introducing imidazole and triazole moieties deserve further investigation.

Cui's group[58,59] reported a series of dehydroepiandrosterone-17-hydrazone derivatives possesing various aromatic heterocycle structures in 17-side chain of steroidal nucleus (Fig. 21, ${ \bf 1 1 2 } \sim { \bf 1 1 4 } ,$ )，which showed distinct anti-roliferative activity against some cancer cells in vitro through inducing cancer cell apoptosis mechanism. Compared with 112 containing a quinoline structure $\mathrm { T C } _ { 5 0 } { : } 1 . 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$ in SGC 7901 cells), the indole substituted product 113 showed a selective cytotoxicity against HeLa cells with the $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $5 . 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$

# 3 CONCLUSION

Although there are many chemotherapy drugs currently on the market, the consequent side effects and tumor metastasis seriously affect the drug efficiencyl21. Recent research work indicated that more than $60 \%$ of the current anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs used in clinic were initially developed from natural products[2, 60l. Steroids are abundant in nature with diversity of structures and wide bioactivities,which are widely used as antitumor agents for a long period of time，such as the phytosterolsl4,61l，diosgenin[62]and cardiotonic steroids[63l. The chemical modification of some natural steroids has been proven a more effective way for the development of anticancer agents,and lots of lead compounds including OSW-1[64] and 2-methoxyestradiol[65] were found as potential therapeutic agents for cancer therapy,which also indicated introducing heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen really altered the chemical and biological properties of a steroid. Therefore,the potential development of heterosteroid as anticancer agents,especially for azasteroidsl6，35]，has gained increasing attention in medicinal field due to the unique heteroatom effects[66.

In this review, some recent progresses on the introduction of anticancer bioactive pharmacophores to steroid motifs with the aim of improving the drug eficiency and selectivity were summarized,and the synthetic method and SAR studies for nitrogen mustard hybrids, $N$ -hetercycles substituted or fused steroids were reported. The classic nitrogenous chain (such as amide,imine,oxime,hydrozone,etc.） and $5 / 6$ -membered nitrogen heterocycles were proved as effective pharmacophores to produce bettr antitumor effect for steroids. SAR investigations also indicated the reason why these nitrogenous steroids exhibited better biological activity than their precursors was atributed to the bulky stereo-configuration,aromaticity,or the possibilities to form hydrogen bonds with biological macromolecules.Hopefully，this review could provide reference and suggestions for the scientists and medicinal chemists for the successful development of nitrogenous steroidal derivatives as novel antitumor drugs.
