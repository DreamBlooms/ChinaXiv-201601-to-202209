ABSTRACTIn this work, the photovoltaic properties of BFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { \mathrm { 6 1 } } B M }$ system as a promising high-performance organic solar cell (OSC） were theoretically investigated by means of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations coupled with the incoherent charge-hopping model.

P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ interface. Furthermore,by the molecular dynamics simulation，the hole mobility of BFBPD thin-film was predicted to be as high as $1 . 2 6 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { c m ^ { 2 } } { \cdot } \mathrm { V ^ { - 1 } } { \cdot } \mathrm { s ^ { - 1 } }$ ，which can be attributed to its dense packing in solid state.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

With the global fosil energy crisis intensified,the development of clean and renewable energy sources has gained widespread attention[1-3l. Relatively, as a clean, stable and renewable energy source,solar energy is an ideal alternative.In recent two decades,organic solar cell(OSC) has attracted intense interest owing to its specific advantages compared to the traditional photovoltaic technology,such as low-cost,solution process ability,light-weight,and the fabrication offlexible large-area devices[4-6l.Since the OSC was invented in 1991, tremendous efforts have been made to improve its performances. Nowadays,the power conversion efficiency (PCE）of OSC devices has been increased to $1 0 \% \sim 1 2 \%$ or even higher[7]，which brings out its broad application prospect in the near future.In OSC devices the active layer is one of the most elements and plays very important roles,which is generally a blend composed by electron donor material and electron acceptor one.The electron donors mainly include organic small molecules and polymers with the strongly optical absorption， whiletheelectron acceptormaterialsareusually fullerenederivatives， suchas [6,6]-phenyl- $C _ { 6 1 }$ -butyric acid methyl ester $\mathrm { ( P C _ { 6 1 } B M ) }$ and [6,6]-phenyl- ${ \bf \cdot } { \bf C } _ { 7 1 }$ -butyric acid methyl ester （204号 $( \mathrm { P C } _ { 7 1 } \mathrm { B M } ) ^ { [ 8 , 9 ] }$ l. Although $\mathrm { P C _ { 6 1 } B M / P C _ { 7 1 } B M }$ has several distinct disadvantages (such as low solubility in organic solvents,poor film forming nature,and weak light-harvesting) compared with those non-fulerene acceptors, the high electron affinity and electron mobility still make it a preferred electron donor in the development of high-performable OSC devices.

Recently, Cai et al. synthesized a novel small molecule material (BFBPD) with the donor-acceptor (D-A) character,and found that the BFBPD thin-film has high hole mobility as wellas the prominent capture to solar radiation[10l. As a result, from the point of molecular properties,BFBPD is likely to be an excelent electron donor material.In this work,to sek novel OSC system, we carried out a computational investigation on the photovoltaic performances for the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system based on density functional theory (DFT） and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations coupled with the incoherent charge-hopping transfer model. Main objectives of this work were to explore the possibility of BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system as a potential high-performable OSC device by means of estimating those properties that are related to the PCE, such as open-circuit voltage,short-circuit currentdensity,fillfactor,exciton-dissociation/charge recombination rate, hole mobility, and so on. Results showed that as expected, the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system is a promising OSC candidate,and its PCE was predicted to be as high as $10 \%$

# 2 COMPUTATIONALDETAILS

All the calculations were performed with density functional theory (DFT）and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) by means of the Gaussian O9 packagel1l. The ground-state geometries were fully optimized without any symmetry constraints by the hybrid B3LYP functional2] combined with 6-31G(d) basis set.Local minima were identified by frequency analysis at the same theoretical level. The absorption spectrum at the optimized ground-state geometry was calculated using the TD-MPW1PW91 method[13] and the 6-31G(d) basis set. To search for the most reasonable geometry of BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ complex,the detailed potential-surface scan was carried out between BFBPD and $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ with the CAM-B3LYP-D3(BJ)/ 6-311G(d,p) schemel14,15]. As seen in Fig. S1,the BFBPD $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ complex was found to be most stable when the centroids distance of BFBPD and $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ is equal to $7 . 9 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ ， which is in good agreement with the recent studies[16,17]. Then,in subsequent calculations,the centroids distance of donor-acceptor complex was invariably fixed at $7 . 9 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ . In addition，we also considered the influence of molecular orientation on the geometry of donor-acceptor complex.As shown in Fig.S2,the molecular orientation affects a little on the studied complex.The inner reorganization energy in electron transfer process was estimated by the classical adiabatic potential energy surface method[18,19]，which has been verified to be accurate and has been used widely in numerous theoretical studies[20-24].Meanwhile,the influence of solid stacking on the inner reorganization energy was also considered by conductor-like polarizable continuum model(C-PCM)[25l. The effective electron coupling $( V _ { D A } )$ in Marcus model was calculated by means of the PW91PW91/6-31G(d) schemel26,27], which has been illustrated to provide the most accurate $V _ { D A }$ value at the DFT level[28,29].

# 3.1Molecular geometries, electronic properties,and open circuit-voltage

As seen in Fig. S3,our optimization revealed that BFBPD molecule keeps a good planar geometry,and the dihedral angle between diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP） and thiophene units is about $1 9 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { o } }$ ，and it remarkably withdraws to $1 . 5 ^ { \mathrm { { \upsilon } } }$ between benzofuran and thiophene，which indicates that BFBPD has good electronic delocalization. Fig.2 shows the HOMO and LUMO for BFBPD, $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ ，and BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ complexes. As seen, in BFBPD molecule both the HOMO and LUMO mainly distribute on the molecular core and the contribution from the benzofuran is small,indicating the frontier molecular orbital is mainlydetermined by the core,instead of the benzofuran unit. In addition, it can be noticed that the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 }$ located in DPP unit contributes nothing to both HOMO and LUMO,denoting the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 }$ has no influence on the frontier molecular orbital and electronic properties of BFBPD, verifying it is very rational to replace 2-ethylhexyl with the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 }$ in this work. Similarly，the methyl-4-phenylbutanoate contributes also small to both HOMO and LUMO in $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ meaning the substituent only enhances the $\mathrm { C } _ { 6 0 }$ solubility,and has no influence on its electronic properties, which is in good agreement with the previous experimental studies[30,311. As for BFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { \mathrm { 6 1 } } B M }$ complex, the HOMO and LUMO exhibit an obvious separation characteristic,and the HOMO completely locates on the BFBPD,while the LUMO mainly centuries on the $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ ，which suggests the easy formation of BFBPD·+ $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { \mathrm { 6 1 } } B M ^ { \bullet \mathrm { - } } }$ charge-separated state.

According to the previous study, the open circuit-voltage $( V _ { o c } )$ for OSCs can be estimated with[32l,

$$
V _ { o c } = ( 1 / e ) ( | E _ { H O M O } ( \mathrm { D } ) | - | E _ { L U M O } ( \mathrm { A } ) | ) - 0 . 3
$$

where $E _ { H O M O } ( D ) / E _ { L U M O } ( A )$ is the HOMO/LUMO level of donor/acceptor, $e$ is the electron charge,and the value of O.3 is an empirical factor. Then, based on the experiment HOMO $( - 5 . 0 \mathrm { e V } ^ { [ 1 0 ] } )$ for BFBPD and LUMO $( - 4 . 0 \ \mathrm { e V } \ ^ { [ 3 3 , 3 4 ] } )$ for $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ the $V _ { o c }$ was estimated to be $0 . 7 0 { \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ for the BFBPD- $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ system. Moreover, we also estimated the PCE for the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system by means of the Scharber diagram.As shown in Fig.3，the PCE of BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system was predicted to be $10 \%$ ，which indicates its excellent photovoltaic performances.

# 3.2Exciton binding energy and optical absorption properties

As is well-known, the exciton binding energy $( E _ { b } )$ is one of the most parameters,which is directly related to the exciton-separation efficiency. Usually, the $E _ { b }$ is taken as the difference between the transport gap $( E _ { \mathrm { f } } )$ and the optical band gap $( E _ { \mathrm { o p t } } )$ . The former is the difference between the adiabatic ionization potential $( E _ { A I P } )$ and electron affinity $( E _ { A E A } )$ of donor in solid state,while the latter is the first-singlet emission energy $( E _ { m } )$ . Then, the $E _ { b }$ can be calculated as the following expression[35],

$$
E _ { \scriptscriptstyle b } = E _ { \scriptscriptstyle A I P } - E _ { \scriptscriptstyle A E A } - E _ { \scriptscriptstyle m }
$$

where $E _ { A I P }$ and $E _ { A E A }$ are the adiabatic ionization potential (AIP) and adiabatic electron afinity (AEA) of donor material, and $E _ { m }$ is the lowest-singlet emission energy. As seen in Eq. (2), to calculate the $E _ { b }$ ,the $E _ { A I P }$ and $E _ { A E A }$ （204 of donor in solid state firstly need to be calculated.In this work, the $E _ { A I P } / E _ { A E A }$ of solid BFBPD was estimated via the method reported by Schwenn et al.36],which has been verified to be a good scheme that estimates the electronic properties of organic materials in solid state.

a The $\mathrm { P ^ { + } / P ^ { - } }$ represents the cation/anion polarization energy.

Table 1 lists the $E _ { A I P } / E _ { A E A }$ values for BFBPD in gas/solid state calculated with two different DFT methods. It can be noted that the $E _ { b }$ was estimated to be $2 . 1 3 9 / 2 . 2 0 7 \ \mathrm { e V }$ in gas phase,which is unusually larger than the measured values of $0 . 2 { \sim } 1 . 0 \ \mathrm { e V }$ in numerous organic materials[37l, indicating the solid stacking maybe has quite strong influence on the electronic properties of organic materials. Calculated cation/anion polarization energy $\mathrm { ( P _ { + } / P _ { - } ) }$ verifies our speculation.As seen, the $\mathrm { P _ { + } / P _ { - } }$ .is as high as $\mathrm { 0 . 7 4 4 / 0 . 9 8 4 ~ e V _ { : } }$ ,indicating it is essential to consider the solid stacking effect for accurately estimating the $E _ { b }$ in theoretical study. Compared the $E _ { A I P } / E _ { A E A }$ values in gas phase to those in solid state, it can be noticed that in gas phase the $E _ { A I P }$ is larger, while the $E _ { A E A }$ is smaller, which is similar to the measured and theoretical results in acenes[38]. According to calculated $E _ { A I P , } \ E _ { A E A }$ ，and $E _ { m }$ for the solid BFBPD,the $E _ { b }$ was estimated to be about $0 . 4 2 7 \ \mathrm { e V } .$ The precious study showed that the exciton is unstable if $E _ { b } < k _ { B } T _ { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ，which amounts to $0 . 0 2 5 \ \mathrm { e V }$ at room temperature[39]. According to the calculated $E _ { b }$ for the BFBPD solid,it can be deduced that the photo-induced exciton in BFBPD is relatively stable,which can be efficiently transported to the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ interface without rapidly being decayed in transit.

As we know,the strong harvest to solar radiation is very important for high-performable donor materials, which directly determines the short-circuit current density. To explore reliable TD-DFT methods estimating optical absorption properties for BFBPD,a set of popular DFT methods were tested.As seen in Table S1, compared with the experimental value,the TD-MPW1PW91/6-31G(d)[40] scheme can accurately estimate the excited energy of BFBPD,and the derivation between the theoreticaland experimental values is only about 1.0 nm (about $2 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { e V }$ ). Moreover,the full absorption spectrum of BFBPD was also simulated.As seen in Fig.S4,in UV-vis region the simulated spectrum for BFBPD is in excellnt agreement with the experimental one,indicating the TD-MPW1PW91/6-31G(d） scheme is reliable to estimate the light absorption and subsequent short-circuit current density.In addition,itcan be noticed in Table S2 that the strongest absorption for BFBPD molecule can be assigned to the $\pi { - } \pi ^ { * }$ type,and dominated completely by the electron transition of

# 3.3Short-circuit current density $J _ { s c }$ ,Fill factor $F F$ ,and PCE $\pmb { \eta }$

The short-circuit current density, $J _ { s c }$ ，is another key parameter that determines the PCE of OSC devices, which can be expressed as[41, 42],

$$
J _ { _ { s c } } = q { \int _ { 0 } ^ { \infty } } { \eta _ { _ { I Q E } } ( \lambda ) \times S ( \lambda ) d \lambda }
$$

where $S ( \lambda )$ is the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency at a fixed wavelength, $q$ is the unit charge, and $\eta _ { I E Q } ( \lambda )$ is the internal quantum efficiency. The $\eta _ { I E Q } ( \lambda )$ term can be described as the product of $\eta _ { \lambda }$ (lightharvesting efficiency), $\eta _ { C T }$ (charge transfer efficiency), and $\eta _ { c o l l }$ (charge collection efficiency),

$$
\eta _ { _ { I Q E } } = \eta _ { _ { \lambda } } \eta _ { _ { C T } } \eta _ { _ { c o l l } }
$$

The $\eta _ { \lambda }$ can be calculated by $\eta _ { \lambda } = 1 - \mathit { 1 0 ^ { - f } }$ ，where $f$ is the oscillator strength. Then, to estimate the maximum $J _ { s c }$ ,we sent the $\eta _ { C T } = 1 . 0$ and $\eta _ { c o l l } = 1 . 0$ Our calculation showed that the $f$ is about 1.4692 at the lowest-excited singlet state for BFBPD,then yielding $\eta _ { \lambda } = 0 . 7 7 0$ .Fig. 4 shows the simulated $\eta _ { I E Q } ( \lambda )$ and $J _ { s c }$ with the above-mentioned parameters.As seen, the $J _ { s c }$ for the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system was predicted to be as high as $1 7 . 2 6 ~ \mathrm { m A } \mathrm { \cdot c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，which can be atributed to the BFBPD strong spectral response.In addition, it can be noticed that the $\eta _ { I E Q } ( \lambda )$ is as large as $8 1 . 7 \%$ in the visible region. Relatively,BFBPD exhibits a weak capture for the ultraviolet radiation $( \eta _ { I E Q } ( \lambda ) \approx 5 7 \% )$ . For the $F F$ calculation, an approximate scheme can be expressed as[43, 44],

$$
F F = \frac { \nu _ { _ { o c } } - \ln ( \nu _ { _ { o c } } + 0 . 7 2 ) } { \nu _ { _ { o c } } + 1 }
$$

where $\nu _ { o c }$ is the dimensionless voltage, which can be estimated with the $V _ { o c } ^ { [ 4 5 , 4 6 ] }$ ，

$$
\nu _ { o c } = \frac { q V _ { o c } } { n k _ { B } T }
$$

where $k _ { B } , T$ and $q$ are Boltzmann constant, temperature (here,we set $T = 3 0 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ )，and elementary charge respectively, $n$ is an ideality factor relating to an ideal $( n = 1 )$ ）or non-ideal $( n > 1 )$ diode[47],organic solar cells typically have ideality factors in the range of $1 . 5 { \sim } 2 . 0$ due to their inherent disorder in solid state[48]. According to the calculated $V _ { o c }$ 1 $( 0 . 7 0 \mathrm { V } )$ for the BFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C } _ { \mathrm { 6 1 } } \mathrm { B M }$ system, the $\nu _ { o c }$ was estimated to be 27.08 at $n = 1 . 0$ and 13.54 at $n = 2$ ,then, the $F F$ forBFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ was predicted to be as high as 0.748 $\zeta _ { n } = 2 . 0 \$ and 0.846 $\zeta _ { n } = 1 . 0 \$ ), in excellent agreement with measured values in most OSC devices. According to the previous study, the PCE $( \eta )$ of OSC devices can be estimated with the following equation[49, 50,

$$
\eta = \frac { P _ { \mathrm { m a x } } } { P _ { i n } } = \frac { V _ { o c } J _ { s c } } { P _ { i n } } F F
$$

where $P _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ and $P _ { i n } ( = 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m W } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 } )$ ）are the maximum and incident power, respectively. With the calculated （204号 $V _ { o c } , J _ { s c } ,$ and $F F$ ，the PCE of BFBPD $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system was predicted to be $9 . 2 3 \%$ $( n = 2 . 0 )$ ）and $1 0 . 2 2 \%$ 0 ${ \bf \dot { \boldsymbol { n } } } =$ （204号 1.0), which is in excellent agreement with the estimated value $( \sim 1 0 \% )$ by means of the Scharber diagram.

# 3.4Gibbs free energies and reorganization energies in exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination

The change of Gibbs free energy $( \Delta G )$ in charge transfer process can be estimated as the energy difference in the final and initial states,accounting for the Coulombic atraction between two opposite charges in charge. separated state.Thus,for the exciton-dissociation, the △G $\langle \Delta G _ { d i s } \rangle$ can be written as[51],

$$
\Delta G _ { d i s } = E _ { _ { D } } ^ { + } ( Q ^ { + } ) + E _ { _ A } ^ { - } ( Q ^ { - } ) - E _ { _ D } ^ { * } ( Q ^ { ^ { * } } ) - E _ { _ A } ^ { 0 } ( Q ^ { 0 } ) + \Delta E _ { _ { c o u l } }
$$

where ${ E _ { D } } ^ { * } ( \boldsymbol { Q } ^ { * } ) / E _ { D } { ^ + } ( \boldsymbol { Q } ^ { + } )$ is the total energy of isolated donor in its equilibrium geometry of the lowest singletexcited/cationic state, $E _ { A } { \mathrm { { ' } } Q \mathrm { { ' } } } Q { \mathrm { { ' } } } Q { \mathrm { { ' } } } Q { \mathrm { { ' } } } Q { \mathrm { { ' } } } Q { \mathrm { { ' } } } Q { \mathrm { { ' } } } $ is the total energy of isolated acceptor in its equilibrium geometry of anionic/neutral state, and $\Delta E _ { c o u l }$ is the Coulombic attraction between donor and acceptor in charge-separated state, which can be estimated with the flowing equation,

$$
\Delta E _ { c o u l } = \sum _ { D ^ { + } } \sum _ { A ^ { - } } \frac { q _ { _ { D ^ { + } } } q _ { _ { A ^ { - } } } } { 4 \pi \varepsilon _ { 0 } \varepsilon _ { s } r _ { _ { D ^ { + } A ^ { - } } } } - \sum _ { D ^ { + } } \sum _ { A } \frac { q _ { D ^ { + } } q _ { _ A } } { 4 \pi \varepsilon _ { 0 } \varepsilon _ { s } r _ { _ { D ^ { * } A } } }
$$

where $q _ { D }$ and $q _ { A }$ are the atomic charge on donor and acceptor in their relevant states with a separation distance, $r _ { D A }$ . The $\scriptstyle { \varepsilon _ { 0 } }$ is the vacuum dielectric constant $( 8 . 8 5 4 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } \ \mathrm { F } { \cdot } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } )$ ，and $\varepsilon _ { s }$ is the static dielectric constant of medium. Similarly, the Gibbs free energy change ( $\left( \Delta \boldsymbol { G } _ { r e c } \right)$ in charge recombination can also be estimated with the expression similar to Eqs. (8) and (9).Here, the $\varepsilon _ { s }$ was estimated with the Clausius-Mossotti equation[52],

$$
\mathcal { E } _ { s } = \left( 1 + \frac { 8 \pi \overline { { \alpha } } } { 3 V } \right) \left( 1 - \frac { 4 \pi \overline { { \alpha } } } { 3 V } \right) ^ { - 1 }
$$

where $V$ is the Connolly molecular volume, $\bar { a }$ is the isotropic component of molecular polarizability, $\bar { a } = \% 3 \sum _ { i } \mathbf { a } _ { i i }$ and $a _ { i i }$ is the diagonal matrix elements of the first-order polarizability tensor. Calculations showed that $\varepsilon _ { s }$ is 3.653 for BFBPD, which is in good accordance with the measured values (ranging from 2.0 to $5 . 0 ^ { [ 5 3 , 5 4 ] }$ in most organic materials. As for $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ , the experimental $\varepsilon _ { s }$ value of $3 . 9 ^ { [ 5 5 ] }$ was used in this work. The total $\varepsilon _ { s }$ （204 of BFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C } _ { \mathrm { 6 1 } } \mathrm { B M }$ system was taken as an average of their respective contribution. Our calculation showed that the $\Delta G _ { d i s }$ is about $- 0 . 4 7 6 \ \mathrm { e V } ,$ while the $\Delta G _ { r e c }$ decreases to $- 0 . 7 2 0 \mathrm { e V } .$ Obviously, the $\Delta G _ { d i s }$ and $\Delta G _ { r e c }$ were calculated to be negative,denoting that the exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination are favorable in thermodynamics. In addition，the smaller $\Delta G _ { r e c }$ indicates a larger driving force in charge-recombination process.

Generally, in organic solids the total reorganization energy $( \lambda )$ of electron transfer can be divided into two sections, namely the internal reorganization energy $( \lambda _ { i n t } )$ and the external one $( \lambda _ { e x t } )$ . In the case of charge dissociation, the $\lambda _ { i n t }$ is taken as an average of the following $\lambda _ { 1 }$ and $\lambda _ { 2 } ^ { \left[ 5 6 \right] }$ ，

$$

$$

where ${ E _ { D } } ^ { * } ( Q ^ { * } ) / { E _ { D } } ^ { * } ( Q ^ { + } )$ is the energy of donor in the lowest excited-state with the equilibrium geometry of excited/cationic state, $E _ { D } { ^ + } ( Q ^ { * } ) / E _ { D } { ^ + } ( Q ^ { + } )$ is the energy of donor in the cationic state with the equilibrium geometry of excited/cationic state, $E _ { A } { } ^ { 0 } ( Q ^ { - } ) / E _ { A } { } ^ { 0 } ( Q ^ { 0 } )$ is the energy of acceptor in the neutral state with the equilibrium geometry of anion/neutral state,and $E _ { A } { \mathrm { { ' } } Q ^ { 0 } } ) / E _ { A } { \mathrm { { ' } } Q ^ { - } } )$ is the energy of acceptor in the anionic state with the equilibrium geometry of neutral/anionic state. Our calculation showed that the $\lambda _ { i n t } \left( \lambda _ { d i s } \right)$ is $0 . 1 1 9 \mathrm { e V }$ in charge-dissociation process for BFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { \mathrm { 6 1 } } B M }$ ，which remarkably increases to $0 . 1 8 9 \ \mathrm { e V }$ in the case of charge recombination. Compared to the $\lambda _ { i n t }$ ，the $\lambda _ { e x t }$ is difficult to accurately calculate. Here,we used the classical dielectric continuum model initially developed by Marcus for the electron-transfer reaction between spherical ions in solution to estimate $\lambda _ { e x t }$ . According to this model, the $\lambda _ { e x t }$ term is given by[57],

$$
\lambda _ { e x t } = \frac { ( \Delta e ) ^ { 2 } } { 8 \pi \varepsilon _ { 0 } } \left( \frac { 1 } { \varepsilon _ { o p } } - \frac { 1 } { \varepsilon _ { s } } \right) \left( \frac { 1 } { R _ { D } } + \frac { 1 } { R _ { A } } - 2 \underset { D } { \sum } \underset { A } { \sum } \frac { q _ { D } q _ { A } } { r _ { D A } } \right)
$$

where $\varepsilon _ { o p }$ is the optical dielectric constant of medium, $R _ { D } ~ ( = 6 . 3 0 \mathring \mathrm { ~ A }$ for BFBPD) and $R _ { A }$ $( = 6 . 5 0 \mathring \mathrm { A }$ for $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M } )$ （20 are the effective radiiof donor and acceptor estimated as the radius of sphere having the same surface as the surface accessible area of molecule. The $q _ { D }$ and $q _ { A }$ denote the atomic charges on the ions. The $\varepsilon _ { o p }$ can be estimated with the Lorentz-Lorenz equation[58, 59],

$$
\varepsilon _ { o p } = n ^ { 2 } = { \frac { V _ { m } + 2 R } { V _ { m } - R } }
$$

where $n$ is the refractive index, $V _ { m }$ is the molar volume ( $\dot { V } _ { m } = \mathbf { M } / \rho$ ，where $\mathbf { M }$ is the molar mass,and $\rho$ is the density of material.),and $R$ is the molar refraction.Here,the $\rho$ was estimated with the molecular dynamics method,and the simulated detail is shown in the supporting information. Our results showed the $\varepsilon _ { o p }$ and $\rho$ for BFBPD are 1.523 and $1 . 3 3 4 \ \mathrm { g } { \cdot } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ ,respectively. As for $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ ,the experimental refractive index ( $' _ { n } = 1 . 8 6 6 )$ was used to estimate $\varepsilon _ { o p }$ ，which is equal to 3.482 according to our calculation.With the above-mentioned parameters, the $\lambda _ { e x t }$ was estimated to be equal to $0 . 2 3 9 { \mathrm { ~ e V } } .$ In summary, $\lambda = 0 . 5 1 2 \mathrm { ~ e V }$ in charge-dissociation process for BFBPD $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system，which remarkably increases to $0 . 5 8 2 { \mathrm { ~ e V } }$ for the charge-recombination process.

# 3.5Electron couplings and exciton-dissociation/charge-recombination recombination rate

The $V _ { D A }$ is an important parameter that determines the charge transfer rate constant $( k _ { D A } )$ . In this work, the direct-coupling (DC) method was used to estimate the $V _ { D A } ^ { [ 6 0 , 6 1 ] }$ . In terms of this scheme, the $V _ { D A }$ can be calculated by the following expression[62, 63],

$$
V _ { D ( i ) A ( j ) } = \frac { T _ { D ( i ) A ( j ) } - 0 . 5 ( e _ { D ( i ) } + e _ { A ( j ) } ) S _ { D ( i ) A ( j ) } } { 1 - S _ { D ( i ) A ( j ) } ^ { 2 } }
$$

where $T _ { D ( i ) \mathrm { A } ( j ) }$ is the electron coupling of the ith molecular orbital of donor and the $j \mathrm { t h }$ molecular orbital of acceptor, $S _ { D ( i ) \mathrm { A } ( j ) }$ is the spatial overlap integral, and $e _ { D ( i ) } / e _ { A ( j ) }$ is the site energy. The $T _ { D ( i ) \mathrm { A } ( j ) } , S _ { D ( i ) \mathrm { A } ( j ) }$ and $e _ { D ( i ) } / e _ { A ( j ) }$ can be obtained from the $T _ { D ( i ) \mathrm { A } ( j ) } = ~ < \psi _ { D ( i ) } | F ^ { K S } | \psi _ { A ( j ) } >$ ， $S _ { D ( i ) \mathrm { A } ( j ) } = ~ < \psi _ { D ( i ) } | \psi _ { A ( j ) } >$ ，and $e _ { D ( i ) } / e _ { A ( j ) } = { \bf \nabla } < \psi _ { D ( i ) } / \psi _ { A ( j ) } \big | F ^ { K S } \big |$ （20 $\psi _ { D ( i ) } / \psi _ { A ( j ) } >$ . Among them, $\psi _ { D ( i ) }$ is the HOMO (for charge-recombination) or LUMO (for charge-dissociation) of donor, $\psi _ { A \left( j \right) }$ is the LUMO of acceptor, and $F ^ { K S }$ is the Kohn-Sham matrix of donor-acceptor system.

$$
\boldsymbol { F } ^ { K S } = S C \varepsilon \boldsymbol { C } ^ { - 1 }
$$

where $S$ is the intermolecular overlap matrix, $C$ is the molecular orbital coefficient matrix from the isolated monomer,and $\varepsilon$ is the orbital energy from one-step diagonalization without iteration. Generally, the $V _ { D A }$ in the exciton-dissociation process is taken as the coupling between the LUMO of donor and acceptor. However, since the $\mathrm { L U M O } { + } 1$ and $\mathrm { L U M O } { + } 2$ in $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ are degenerated energetically with its LUMOl64l， the $V _ { D A }$ （204 between the LUMO of BFBPD and LUMO $+$ 1/LUMO+2 of $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ was also computed. Finally, the average $V _ { D A }$ was used to calculate the $k _ { D A }$ . As for the charge-recombination,the same treatment was done.Our results showed that the $V _ { D A }$ is about $0 . 0 3 4 \ \mathrm { e V }$ in exciton dissociation, which decreases to $0 . 0 2 6  { \mathrm { ~ \ e V } }$ in charge recombination.At high temperature and weak coupling limits,the charge transfer in organic materials involves a thermally activated hopping mechanism. According to the Marcus theoryl65,6l,the $k _ { D A }$ can be expressed as

$$
k _ { _ { D A } } = \frac { V _ { D A } ^ { 2 } } { \mathrm { h } } \Bigg ( \frac { \pi } { \lambda k _ { _ B } T } \Bigg ) ^ { 1 / 2 } \exp \Bigg [ - \frac { ( \Delta G + \lambda ) ^ { 2 } } { 4 \lambda k _ { _ B } T } \Bigg ]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the total reorganization energy, $V _ { D A }$ is the effective electron coupling, $T$ is the temperature, $\hbar$ and $k _ { B }$ （204号 are the reduced Planck and Boltzmann constants respectively,and $\Delta G$ is the change of Gibbs free energy between the final state and first one.Based on the calculated $\lambda$ and $V _ { D A }$ ， the exciton-dissociation $( k _ { d i s } )$ and charge-recombination $( k _ { r e c } )$ rate constants were estimated to be as high as $2 . 6 8 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 3 }$ and $\mathrm { 1 . 1 0 8 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 3 } ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ （204号 respectively in BFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { \mathrm { 6 1 } } B M }$ interface.Recent studies have illustrated that the decay rate constant $( k _ { d } )$ of excited organic molecules typically ranges $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ to $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } ~ \mathrm { s ^ { - 1 [ 6 7 ] } }$ . Our results showed that the $k _ { d i s }$ is larger $3 { \sim } 5$ orders of magnitude than the $k _ { d }$ ,which indicates very high exciton-dissociation efficiency $( \sim 1 0 0 \% )$ （204号 in the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ interface. In addition,although the $k _ { r e c }$ is relatively larger, the charge-recombination efficiency is still very low. According to previous studies,the electron transferred onto $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ can be rapidly converted to the triplet state from the singlet statel68,69], which remarkably hinders from the recombination of free carriers.

# 3.6Hole transfer rate and hole mobility in BFBPD thin-film

As is known to all,the charge transport ability of donor remarkably affects the solar cel's performance. Thus,it is essential to estimate charge transport properties of BFBPD thin-film.The charge transport ability in organic materials can be chartered with its carrier mobility $( \mu )$ ，which can be calculated by means of the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation[70, 71],

$$
\mu { = } \frac { e D } { k _ { \mathrm { B } } T }
$$

where $D$ is diffusion coefficient, $e$ is elementary charge, $k _ { B }$ is Boltzmann constant,and $T$ is temperature, respectively. The $D$ can be estimated by means of the following appropriate relation[72,73],

$$
D \approx \frac { 1 } { 2 n } \sum _ { i } d _ { i } ^ { 2 } k _ { i } P _ { i }
$$

where $n$ is the spatial dimensionality,which is 3 for organic solids, $d _ { i }$ is the centroids distance of the ith hopping dimer, $k _ { i }$ is the charge transfer rate constant,and $P _ { i }$ （204号 $\begin{array} { r } { ( P _ { i } = k _ { i } / \Sigma _ { i } k _ { i } } \end{array}$ ） is the hopping probability. In this work,the charge mobility of BFBPD thin-film was evaluated by means of an amorphous cell with 1OO BFBPD molecules built by means of the molecular dynamics simulation. As seen in Fig.5,our result showed that the BFBPD molecules in solid state exhibit a close-packed patern, which is favorable for the hole-carrier transfer.

Fig.5.Optimized amorphous cell with 10o BFBPD molecules

Table 2 shows the calculated $\lambda _ { i n t }$ term for BFBPD in hole transfer with two different DFT methods.As seen, the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d） scheme presented quite large $\lambda _ { i n t }$ values due to considering the long-range correlation effect. In addition, it can be noticed that the $\lambda _ { i n t }$ in solid state is obviously smaller than that in gas phase,denoting that the solid stack,to some extent,limits the structural relaxation of BFBPD molecule in charge transfer process Since the donor materials in OSC devices usually keep in solid state under operating conditions, the $\lambda _ { i n t }$ estimated by means of the solid state model is more reasonable and reliable.

$\overline { { a \lambda _ { 1 } } }$ is the structural relaxation energy from neutral state to cation state. $' \lambda _ { 2 }$ is the structural relaxation energy from cation state to neutral state.

To explore possble charge transfer dimers,2O molecular pairs with relatively larger $V _ { D A }$ values were abstracted from the optimized amorphous cell,and their geometries,centroids distances,as wellas estimated $V _ { D A }$ values are shown in Table S3.Based on $\lambda _ { i n t }$ in the solid state and $V _ { D A }$ values,the hole carrier mobility $( \mu _ { h } )$

of solid BFBPD thin-film was estimated to be as high as $1 . 2 6 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { ~ c m } ^ { 2 } \cdot \mathbf { V } ^ { - 1 } \cdot \mathbf { s } ^ { - 1 } $ ，which is in excellent agreement with its measured value of $3 . 7 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \sim 9 . 0 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { c m ^ { 2 } } { \cdot } \mathrm { V ^ { - 1 } } { \cdot } \mathrm { s ^ { - 1 [ 1 0 ] } }$ ，According to the previous investigation, for high-performance electron donor materials, the $\mu _ { h }$ should be not less than $1 0 ^ { - 3 } \thinspace \mathrm { c m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } V ^ { - 1 } { \cdot } s ^ { - 1 [ 3 2 ] } }$ Our result showed as a potential donor material,the BFBPD can satisfy the requirement that rapidly transports holes.

# 4 CONCLUSION

In this work,with DFT/TD-DFT calculations, the photovoltaic properties of BFBPD- $\mathrm { \cdot P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system were theoretically investigated.Results revealed that the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system possesses middle-sized open-circuit voltage of $0 . 7 0 { \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ , large short-circuit current density of $1 7 . 2 6 ~ \mathrm { m A } { \cdot } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ,high fill factor of 0.846 and power conversion efficiency of $10 \%$ . Based on the Marcus charge transfer model, the $k _ { d i s } ( 2 . 6 8 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 3 } ~ \mathrm { s ^ { - 1 } ) }$ （20 was estimated to be larger $3 { \sim } 5$ orders of magnitude than the $k _ { d } ( 1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ to $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } .$ ),which indicates very high exciton-dissociation efficiency $( \sim 1 0 0 \% )$ ）in the BFBPD- $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ interface.Moreover，with an amorphous celloptimized by molecular dynamics method,the hole carier mobility for BFBPD thin-film was predicted to be as high as $1 . 2 6 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { c m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } V ^ { - 1 } { \cdot } s ^ { - 1 } }$ at room temperature. In brief,our calculations showed that BFBPD is an excellent electron donor material,and the BFBPD $\mathrm { . P C _ { 6 1 } B M }$ system is a promising OSC candidate.However, these results need to be confirmed by experiments.
