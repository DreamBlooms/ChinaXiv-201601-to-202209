# ABSTRACT

A new chemical class of potent DPP-IV inhibitors has been structurally derived from our recently disclosed pyrrolopyrimidine scafold by replacing cyanobenzyl with butynyl group. Systematic variations and structure-activity relationship studies have been conducted on the starting hit 51 ( $\mathrm { T C } _ { 5 0 } \mathrm { = }$ $0 . 4 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ . Consequently, compound 78 $\mathrm { \small { I C } } _ { 5 0 } = 1 . 5 5 ~ \mathrm { \ n M } )$ ） was identified to be a potent, selective, and orally available lead, worth further evaluations and optimizations.

Keywords: DPP-IV inhibitor; type 2 diabetes; hit to lead optimization, SAR study.

# 1.Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) formerly referred to as non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes,results from the body's ineffective use of insulin and comprises over $90 \%$ of diabetes patients.With more than 220 million people affected worldwide,diabetes has emerged as an epidemic,reflecting the insufficient glycemic control and the urgency of more treatments [1]. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors have been demonstrated to be effective and safe interventions that control blood glucose for good patient compliance and reduced risks of hypoglycemia and lesside effects [2-4].To date,Sitagliptin 1 [5-6], Vildaglipin 2[7-9], Saxagliptin 3[10],Alogliptin 4[11] and Linagliptin 5[12] are on the market worldwide (Figure 1). Among them, Linagliptin has demonstrated to be with superior potency and longest duration of action.

We previously reported a novel series of DPP-IV inhibitors bearing pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold, represented by compound 6 (Figure 2), which is currently undergoing systematic preclinical evaluations [13]. Inspired by Linagliptin, we replaced cyanobenzyl group with butynyl group on our published scaffold and led to compound 7. However this replacement sharply decreased DPP-IV inhibitory ability with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of $0 . 8 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ .Whereas none substituted compound 51 displayed much stronger inhibitory ability $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } { = } ~ 0 . 4 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ ， Figure 2). Systematic hit optimization has conducted mainly on the N-5 variations to led compound 78 ( $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } { = } 1 . 5 5 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ , Table 2). Preliminary evaluations demonstrated that 78 is a potent, selective, safe, and oral bioavailable lead.

Herein,we report the hit to lead optimization on the novel butynyl incorporated pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold and the evaluations of 78.

# 2. Chemistry

The synthesis of compounds 21a-d is outlined in Scheme 1. Briefly, 6-Methyluracil 11 was easily transformed to 12 via a typical nitrification. Subsequently,13 was obtained via a condensation reaction of 12 and N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal, then 13 was treated by zinc powder in acetic acid

# 3. Results and Discussion

# 3.1. Novel butynyl group incorporated pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold.

According to the previous structure-activity relationship of xanthines [12], we noticed an increase in activity from N-7 aromatic group to N-7 aliphalic substitution. It suggests that aliphalic chain maybe more suitable for the hydrophobic S1 pocket of DPP-IV enzyme.Besides,N-7 butynyl derivatized scaffold has proved to be an efective measure to abolish side effects like hERG and M1 receptor inhibition in Linagliptin[12]. Thus we replaced the N-3 cyanobenzyl group of former pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold with butynyl group and generated the initial compound 7 (Table 1). Opposite to our expectation, this alternation sharply decreased the activity.In our earlier research,we noticed that bromo had litte effect on the activity [13]. Thus none substituted compound 51 was generated and determined to have a much improvement in activity (Table 1). In vitro dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) inhibitory $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values indicated that it is a moderate inhibitor against DPP-IV $( 0 . 4 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ and free from inhibition of DPP-8, 9 (both ${ \displaystyle > 1 0 ~ \mu \mathbf { M } } )$ .It also did not inhibit the human Ether- $\grave { \mathbf { a } }$ -go-go Related Gene (hERG) ion channel （204号 $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } { > } 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { M } )$ , which may be related with cardiovascular risk [14-15]. Thus 51 is a potential and safe hit for further optimization.

# 3.2. Optimization and structure-activity relationship study on hit compound 51.

The active sites and important residues of DPP-IV are well reported. And sufficient proves show the necessity of aminopiperidine substituent for xanthine derived scaffold. The whole fraction occupies the S2 subsite. Primary amine interacts with Glu2O5,Glu2O6,and Tyr662 through charge-reinforced hydrogen bonds [11-12]. Thus we turn on our atention to N-5 substituent and conduct the optimization mainly on the ${ \bf R } _ { 5 }$ variations (Table 1).

Methyl substituted 52 sharply decreased the $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value by more than a half. It showed a positive signal for N-5 optimization. Incorporation with acetonitrile and butynyl group (53 and 54 respectively) went on validating the increase in activity. Yet, 4-fluorobenzyl substituted 55 gave an exception for an extreme weak inhibition. However, the following ring(s) substitution showed stronger inhibition. Single ring,2-methylpyrimidinyl substituted 56 had one fold increase compared to aliphalic chain substitution 54. Bicyclo rings (57-60) substitutions were obviously more effective to strengthen the DPP-IV affinity represented by 60 ( $\mathrm { \ T C _ { 5 0 } } { = } 7 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ ). Generally on the N-5 variations from 51 to 60, DPP-IV inhibitory activity is dependent on the size and direction of fraction to some extent.考虑加一句

Encouraged by 2-methylquinolinyl added 60,70-75 were synthesized to evaluated substituents' impact on quinoline (Table 2). Overall, halogen or methoxy incorporation obstructed the interaction between inhibitor and enzyme, exhibited by a smallto moderate decrease in activity (70-73). Thus the smaller the atom is, the better the activity is.Besides electron effect had litle effect on activity (73). Yet, it is worth to indicate that 7-quinoline substitution, especially small atom, may help the combination (74-75).

Simply switch from quinoline to qinazoline or quinoxaline fraction led to compounds 76-78 (Table 2). Compound 78 showed a very potent activity with $1 . 5 5 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ （20 $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ ，as well as 76 with 5.93 nM $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ .It suggested that hydrophobic and aromatic rings are more suitable to be placed at N-5. The corresponding interaction sites of the DPP-IV enzyme are probably hydrophobic at this position and have aromatic residues to interact with inhibitors by $\pi$ -stacking. Also this may explain that halogen substitutes did not help to the affinity.

# 3.3. Evaluations on compound 78.

Further inhibitory assays had conducted on the most potent compound 78. Gratefullyit did not inhibit hERG channel within $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$ ,and free from inhibition against DPP-8, 9 to $1 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$

Pharmacokinetic profile of 78 in rat is in Table 3. Compared with our reported compound 6, it has a longer half life in rat and twice the bioavailability,which is compatible with the marketed DPP-IV inhibitor (Alogliptin: $45 \%$ , Linagliptin: $5 0 . 7 \%$ ）[12,16]. Thus 78 is a promising lead worth of in depth evaluations and further optimization.

# 4. Conclusions

A general hit to lead optimization and SAR study have conducted on a new chemical class 51 $\mathrm { ( I C _ { 5 0 } = }$

$0 . 4 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ . N-5variations indicate that hydrophobic and aromatic rings probably have stronger interaction with the DPP-IV enzyme at this position for the new class. As a result,compound 78 ( $\mathrm { { T C } _ { 5 0 } = }$ （20 $0 . 4 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ has generated and identified to be a promising lead compound with good selectivity, low cardiovascular risk,and compatible pharmacokinetic profile. Evidences show 78 is worth in depth evaluations and further optimizations will be carried subsequently.
