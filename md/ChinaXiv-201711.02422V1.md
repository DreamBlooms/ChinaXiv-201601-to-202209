# ABSTRACT

llcicuitaly tyusma typc 1 (illl） iS a severe human autosomal recessive disorder caused bythedeficiencyoffumarylacetoacetate hydroxylase (FAH),an enzyme catalyzing the last step in the tyrosine degradation pathway.Lack of FAH causes accumulation of toxic metabolites (fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone） in blood and tissues,ultimately resulting in severe liver and kidney damage with onset that ranges from infancy to adolescence.This tissue damage is lethal but can be controlled by administration of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohex anedion(NTBC)， whichinhibitstyrosine catabolism upstream ofthegenerationof fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone.Notably, in animals lacking Fah, transient withdrawal of NTBC can be used to induce liver damage and a concomitant regenerative response that stimulates the growth of healthy hepatocytes. Among other things,this model has raised tremendous interest for the in vivo expansion of human primary hepatocytesinside these animals， andfor exploringexperimentalgenetherapyand cell-based therapies.

attractive alternative for modeling the consequences ofHT1.

Animal models bearing mutations/truncations in genes causing human disease are essential to understand the mechanisms underlying those diseases， and to identify new diagnosticor therapeutic procedures. In some cases， the idiosyncrasy of human disease has also made these animals valuable for unexpected applications (1). One such example are $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ mice (2), which have been genetically engineered to lack fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH),an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the last step in the degradation of the amino acid tyrosine (3). In humans, lackofFAHcauseshereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1)，a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by retrograde accumulation of toxicmetabolitesincluding fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone in blood and tissues,which ultimately causes liver failure and renal tubular dysfunction as the most prominent manifestations (4,5). Liver failure can develop acutely in the first few months after birth or be more progressive. Treatment of HT1 consists mainly of administration of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohex anedion (NTBC),which inhibits the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid by 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, the second step in the tyrosine degradation pathway， thus preventing the accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone (6). Yet, if patients are diagnosed too late or do not comply with NTBC treatment， there is end-stage liver diseasewithcirrhosisandhighriskof hepatocellular carcinoma due to chronic damage. Notably, in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ mice,controlled withdrawal of NTBC can be used to cause liver damage in a desired manner, inducing the generation of a regenerative response that allows repopulation of the damaged liver by the remaining normal hepatocytes after NTBC is added back (2,7). When $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ mice are simultaneously deficient in key genes regulating the immune response (e.g., $R a g 2 \mathrm { \ a n d / o r \ } I l 2 r g )$ , the same principle allows liver repopulationwithtransplantedheterologous primaryhepatocytes(8)， stemcell-derived hepatocytes (9),or transdifferentiated hepatocytes (10,11) without immune rejection.

For a long time, genetic engineering of mammals has been mostly restricted to mice.This is because of the availability of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the relative ease of manipulating these cells with traditional gene modification techniques. Genetically modified ESCs can then be injected into mouse blastocysts to produce chimeric animals with germ line transmission (12). Somatic cell modification and nucleartransferhasbeentraditionallyan alternative for genetic engineering of species for which bona fide ESCs are not available,but the procedure is inefficient (13). More recently， the development of designer nuclease technologies (zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effectornucleases[TALENs]， andclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats [CRISPR]/CRISPR-associated protein 9 [Cas9] (14) has expanded significantly the repertoire of species (e.g., rats,rabbits,dogs,pigs，sheep, and cattle）（15-20） amenable to routine genetic engineering， and made the procedure a less time-consuming effort; bona fide rat ESCs were also isolated recently (21,22).Accordingly, several groups have reported the generation of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ pigs (23,24) and rats (25,26)， which offer some advantages over $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ mice.

Rabbitsarewidelyusedforanimal experimentation. Their physiology is closer to humans than rodents,and they have relativelylow cost maintenance and are easy to breed (27,28).

Herein,we report the generation of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits by injecting TALENs into the cytoplasm of rabbit pronuclear-stage embryos. These $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits haveliverand kidneyphenotypicfeatures analogous to $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rodents and pigs,but also develop frequent ocular manifestations including corneal keratitis.We further show that allogeneic transplantationofwild-typerabbitprimary hepatocytes achieves efficient liver repopulation and improves the liver function and survival rate of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits.These results demonstrate that geneticallyengineered Fahrabbitsarean attractive choice for modeling the consequences of HT1.

# RESULTS

Construction of TALENs and generation of Fah knockout rabbits- We designed a pair of TALENs targeting exon 2 of the rabbit Fah gene (Figure 1A), and assembled them according to the Golden Gate method with the following codes: NI foradenine,NG for thymine, HD for cytosine,and NNforguanine.Weinjecteddifferent concentrations（10,20,30,50,and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / \mu L } }$ of in vitro transcribed TALEN-coding mRNAs into the cytoplasm of rabbit pronuclear-stage embryos (20,27)，and then transferred the embryos into surrogate mothers. NTBC was administered to pregnant rabbits from day 15 of pregnancy to prevent intrauterine death (2). With the highest concentration of TALEN mRNAs， all foster mothers miscarried and no rabbits were born (Table I). The pregnancy was not affected with the other TALEN mRNA concentrations; a total of 31 rabbits were born and the ear tissue of each animal was collected for genotyping. With the lowest concentration of TALEN mRNAs,all 6 newborn rabbits were negative for gene targeting. Yet, we detected Fah mutations using 2O and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ and the targeting efficiency was $100 \%$ (4 out of 4 newborns） using $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / \mu L }$ (Table I). These Fah mutant rabbits were mostly mosaic,with different indels (insertions and/or deletions) within the Fah locus, as shown in (Figure 1B). Through breeding of Fah mutant founder (FO) animals,we obtained a total of $9 F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ first filial generation (F1) rabbits (Figure 1C) and $8 ~ F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbits,which appeared healthy at birth.These animals were bred further to produce additional filial generations.

Toascertain the importance of NTBC administration in preventing death of Fah rabbits, we prepared $1 3 F a h ^ { \scriptscriptstyle - / - }$ rabbits and divided them into 3groups， each with differentNTBC administration modes (Figure 1D). The rabbits were closely monitored to collect blood before death and to store the tissues in good condition. In the first group, no NTBC was administered at any time after birth,and these animals died shortly (within 1 week after birth) (Figure 1E). In the second and third groups, NTBC was continuously administered until the rabbits were 2 weeks or 1 month old,respectively. Rabbits in the second group survived no longer than 3 weeks after birth, whilst rabbits in the third group were able to live as long as 4 months after birth (Figure 1E). Western blot analysis of liver tissue lysates from 2 dead $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits showed that FAHwas undetectable when compared with wild-type rabbits(Figure 1F). Likewise， heterozygous knockout $( F a h ^ { + / - } )$ rabbits expressed half of the amount of protein of the wild-type. Thus,we have generated $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbitsthat can onlybe maintained alivewith NTBC， and we next proceeded to study whether these animals develop characteristic phenotypic features of HT1.

Fah'-rabbitshave liver and kidney phenotypic characteristics of HT1- We dissected the bodies of dead $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits belonging to the above-mentioned groups,and observed prominent liver swelling， hemorrhage, and yellow/green discoloration suggestive of both cholestasis and liver necrosis,in contrast to the normal aspect of their wild-type counterparts (Figure 2A). We also collected and sectioned the liver and kidney tissues for immunohistological analysis with FAH antibodies. Asexpected， FAHproteinwas completely absent in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ livers and kidneys,2 tissues that normally express it at high level, but displayed strong staining in wild-type rabbits (Figure 2B). In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed diffuse hepatocellular injury with dysplastichepatocytesand tubule-interstitial nephritis in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits only (Figure 2C), both of which are hallmarks of HT1. Moreover, picrosirius red staining (29) revealed mild fibrosis in the liver of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits but not in wild-type (Figure 2D),which is in agreement with $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ mice but contrasts with the development of cirrhosis in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rats and pigs (25,30). In addition. we extracted serum from blood samples and analyzed the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)，aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and triglycerides， all of which are elevated asa consequence of liver damage (23). Significant increase of all 3 parameters was observed in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits maintained without NTBC compared to wild-type rabbits (Figure 2E). We also detected that tyrosine levels had increased in $F a h ^ { - / - }$ rabbits maintained without NTBC， illustrating that, as expected，deletion of Fah blocks the tyrosine metabolic pathway (2,5). Altogether, these results confirm that $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits develop features similar to HT1 patients and rodent/pig models (5,7,23-26).

Ocular manifestations in Fah knockout rabbits- Ocular involvement is not frequent in HT1 patients but in those rare cases corneal keratitis is the main manifestation (31,32).This has been attributed to inflammation produced by local tyrosine deposition in the form of crystals, which is caused by low compliance with a low-protein diet and the secondary effect of using NTBC on tyrosine accumulation. Interestingly, in the course of our study,we noticed that Fah knockoutrabbitsdevelopfrequentocular manifestations too.This problem was observed in all third filial generation $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits and a small proportion of $F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbits. Of note, although the latter were not treated with NTBC at any time after birth,it was administered to their mothers during pregnancy. We performed ophthalmological analysisof $2 F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbits compared to a wild-type rabbit. Through direct eye inspection, we discovered keratoleukoma accompanied by edema and opacity in both eyes of the $2 F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbits (Figure 3A). Using slit lamp imaging, we also noticed deeper chamber depth and lens opacification accompanied with dilated pupil and posterior synechia of the iris in the right eye of the first $F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbit (Figure 3B), implying cataract and iritis.Moreover, in the same rabbit there was a pathogenic high intraocular pressure of $4 8 . 3 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ $\mathrm { H g }$ in the left eye (Figure 3C)， indicating secondary glaucoma, whilst intraocular pressure in the right eye was normal. Conversely,chamber depth and intraocular pressure were normal in the second $F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbit (Figure 3B and C),and no significant cataract was found. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed edema and thickening in the corneal epithelium and stroma of both $F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbits, and the corneal surface became irregular in particular in the left eye of the second $F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbit (Figure 3D). Moreover, swelling, condensed nuclei, and fragmented bodies could be seen in corneal epithelial and stroma cells in both $F a h ^ { + / - }$ rabbits, indicating necrocytosis (Figure 3D). Therefore, there is frequent ocular involvement, mostly manifested as corneal keratitis,in Fah knockout rabbits.

Allogeneic primary hepatocyte transplantation rescues liver damage of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits- We then studied whether transplantation of Fah-competent hepatocytes could rescue the liver phenotype and prevent death of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits untreated with NTBC.First, to assess feasibility, we induced acute liver damage in wild-type rabbits with Concavalin A (33)，which causes a rapidregenerativeresponsethatfacilitates engraftment of transplanted cells, and 24 hours later $1 0 ^ { 7 }$ rabbit primary hepatocytes extracted from ahealthywild-typerabbitwereinjected intrasplenically. To assist with their identification, transplanted hepatocytes were labeled with Dil, as this fluorescent compound can last as long as 1 month in vivo (34,35). The recipient animals were immunosuppressed with Cyclosporin A starting 24 hours before transplantation. We observed a large number of Dil-positive cells in liver sections 3 weeks after transplantation, proving the efficacy of the approach (Figure 4A). Next, we transplanted wild-type rabbit primary hepatocytes into $2 ~ F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits that had been treated with NTBC after birth A wild-type rabbit and a non-transplanted $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbit treated with NTBC were used as controls. NTBC was gradually decreased in the $3 F a h ^ { - / - }$ rabbits,and completely withdrawn 1 week after the transplantation (Figure 4B). One month after NTBC withdrawal, a small liver biopsy was obtained from one of the transplanted $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits andthenon-transplanted $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbitfor histological analysis. Approximately $30 \%$ of liver cells in the examined liver sections of the transplanted $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbit were DiI-positive at this timepoint(Figure4C). Likewise， FAH immunohistochemistryconfirmedsignificant engraftment of FAH-positive hepatocytes in the same $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ transplantedrabbit， andthese hepatocytes displayed normal morphologyin contrast with damaged cels in non-engrafted areas (Figure 5A). We also measured weight in these $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits and the wild-type control over the post-transplantation period. We noticed that，11 weeks after NTBC withdrawal the $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbit that did not receive transplantation showed a $40 \%$ decrease in body weight and died shortly after, whilst the wild-type and $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits receiving allogeneic hepatocyte transplantation had similar weight and appeared healthy (Figure 5B and C). In addition， we performed serum biochemical analysis over the post-transplantation period to see whether liver function can be recovered in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits compared to the control. Indeed, ALT and AST values of wild-type and a transplanted $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbit were alike at week 10 post-transplantation, whilst the non-transplanted $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbit showed significantly higher values (Figure 5D and E). Interestingly,we also observed more engrafted FAH-positive cells at three months inthe transplanted $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits (Figure 5F and G), indicating long-term stability of the engrafted cells and suggesting in vivo proliferation. These data prove the utility of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits as tools for testing experimental methodologies involving liver cell transplantation.

# DISCUSSION

PatientswithHT1aretreatedwithNTBCand dietary restrictions but this is not curative and, besides,a number of individuals fail to respond and require liver transplantation (7). Because shortage of donors limits organ transplantation, other therapeutic strategies (e.g.， stem cell-based or gene therapy approaches) are urgently needed to treatthispatientpopulation.Appropriate preclinical animal models are required for testing these experimental therapies and although $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ mice present many phenotypic features of HT1, their physiology (e.g.， inflammatory responses (36))differs significantly from humans.Likewise, their small size and short life span pose a limitation for analytical studies and long-term assessments.Aiming to solve these issues, $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rats (25,26),and in particular pigs (23,24),have been generated recently. However, whilst pigs have many advantages over rodents for HT1 disease modeling, their handling and breeding is laborious and costly.

Rabbits are excellent animals for state-of-the-art animal experimentation. They are closer phylogenetically to primates than rodents and have a longer life span (8-1O years),whilst their medium size， short pregnancy period （1 monthversus4inpigs)， andrelatively straightforward husbandry requirements facilitate production of large cohorts at relatively low cost (27,28). Like pigs， rabbits also have a more diversegenetic background than rodents，a situation that is closer to that in humans. Notably, the first transgenic rabbits were generated over 3 decades ago (37,38)， but the lack of bona fide rabbit ESCs for more complex genetic engineering and the inefficiency of rabbit somatic cell nuclear transfer(39） hampered the development of the field until the arrival of highly efficient designer nuclease technologies (20,40-42).

Ourworkpresented here isthe first description of genetically engineered $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits We used TALEN mRNA microinjection into pronuclear-stage rabbit embryos (2O) rather than the CRISPR/Cas9 system (40,43） because we envisaged that for embryo injections the toxicity and off-target effects of the former are easier to control (44),though recent improvements of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique could solve this issue (45). Fah/ rabbitsdisplay liver and kidney manifestations of the human genetic disorder but also have frequent ocular alterations(mostly corneal keratitis). Ocular involvement is rare in patients with HT1 but frequent in patients with tyrosinemia type I (46),which is produced by mutations in tyrosine transaminase,the enzyme undertaking the first step of tyrosine catabolism. As with tyrosinemia type II, corneal keratitis in HT1 patients,and possibly Fah knockout rabbits too,is caused by enhanced local accumulation of tyrosine,which is boosted by NTBC(31,32). The frequencywithwhichocularmanifestations happen in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits potentially makes them a useful model for studying how to prevent and treat this potential complication in HT1 patients. $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits did not develop cirrhosis in our study, although it is likely that varying the NTBC administration/withdrawal routine and allowing more chronic damage would induce it. Besides being an excellent choice for modeling HT1 and studying chronic liver damage, $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits could also be employed for testing gene therapy approaches, which have proved successful in $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ mice and pigs but require additional studies to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy (24). In addition，Fah'rabbitscould be exceptional bioreactorsforgrowingprimary human hepatocytes for in vivo human disease modeling (e.g.， hepatitis B or C)， potential xenotransplantation, or for in vitro studies,but this wouldrequireproducing $F a h ^ { - / - } R a g 2 ^ { - / - } I l 2 r g ^ { - / - }$ rabbits to avoid immune rejection. Such triple knockout animals would be valuable too as preclinical models for experimental stem cell based-therapies, including the transplantation of hepatocyte-likecellsderived frominduced pluripotent stem cells (11） or produced through transdifferentiation (1O,11).Given the time and cost of pursuing this approach in pigs,rabbits offer an attractive option.

In summary,we have demonstrated that $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits are a promising alternative for modeling HT1 and for developing therapeutic strategies aiming to cure this disease. From a wider perspective, our work also shows that genetically engineered rabbits offer a powerful approach to recapitulating human disease.

# EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

Animals andethicsstatement-NewZealand white rabbits were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Centre of Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China).All rabbit experiments were conducted under the approval of the Animal Care and Use committee of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (ID 2012040) and the Department of Science and Technologyof Guangdong Province (ID SYXK 2005-0063). Animals were observed at least once daily for clinical signs and symptoms consistent with acute liver failure.To obtain $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ and $F a h ^ { + / - } \mathrm { F } 1$ rabbits, we breed FO animals with each other, and then we bred FO with F1 and F1 with F1,and so on, for producing other filial generations.For details of which rabbits were used in each experiment and their respectivegenotypessee Supplemental Table I. Pregnant rabbits giving birth to $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits received NTBC $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ per $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of drinking water per day beginning on day 15 of pregnancy. Thesame dosewasusedfor maintenance of $F a h ^ { - \prime - }$ rabbits. Ophtalmological evaluation wasperformedin Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University.

TALEN preparation, embryo microinjection, and embryo transfer- TALENswere designed and assembled according to the Golden Gate assembly method (27). In vitro transcribed TALEN mRNAs were prepared using mMESSAGE mMACHINE? T7 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX,USA) and purified using RNeasy Mini Elute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,USA). The TALEN microinjection procedure was essentially as described previously (27).Briefly:6-8 months old female rabbits were induced to superovulate with 5O IU FSH every 3 hours for 3 days, mated with male rabbits about 72 hours later, and injected with $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { I U }$ of human chorionicgonadotropin. Female rabbitswere euthanized 18 hours after injection and the oviducts were flushed with pre-warmed embryo manipulation medium for collecting embryos at the pronuclear stage. Mixed in vitro transcribed TALEN mRNAs were microinjected into the cytoplasm,and then embryos were transferred to EBSS medium for in vitro culture in a $5 \%$ CO2 incubatorat $3 8 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with $100 \%$ humidity.

Approximately 15-30 good quality (as judged by microscope inspection） injected embryos were transferred into unilateral pavilions of the oviducts for each recipient mother.

Genotyping- DNA of newborn rabbits was extracted from a small piece of ear tissue using a Hipure Tissue DNA Mini Kit (Magen, Beijing, China） following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR products spanning the TALEN target sites wereamplifiedwith KOD-Plus-Neo DNA Polymerase（TOYOBO，Tokyo，Japan）with the following primers: $5 ^ { \circ }$ -GCACTTGAGCCATCGTCCGT (FAH-F） and $5 ^ { \circ }$ -ACCAGCAGCAGGCAATCCCA (FAH-R), and then sequenced.

Western blot assay- For Western blotting, liver tissue samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer and centrifuged at $^ { 1 4 , 5 0 0 } \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 30 minutes; supernatants were then collected and protein concentration quantified. Lysates were subjectedto $10 \%$ polyacrylamide-SDSgel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Temecula,CA，USA).Membraneswere blocked with $5 \%$ evaporated milk in TBST for 2 hours and incubated overnight at room temperature with primaryantibodiesagainstFAH(ab140167, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).Membranes were then incubated with a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (sc-20o4， Santa Cruz，CA, USA） for 60 minutes at room temperature and imaged using a SuperSignalTMWest Pico ChemiluminescenceSubstratekit (Thermo, Rockford, USA). ACTIN antibody (sc-47778, Santa Cruz, CA，USA） was probed as loading control.

Histology- Liver and kidney tissues were fixed with $4 \%$ neutral buffered paraformaldehyde for 48 hours and processed for paraffin embedding andsectioning.Forimmunohistochemistry staining,antigen retrieval was performed in a $1 \textbf { M }$ citrate buffer $\left( \mathrm { p H } 6 . 0 \right)$ bath for 2O minutes.Tissues were immunostained with anti-FAH primary antibodies(ab140167） andvisualizedusing VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit(Vector Laboratories, CA,USA).Hematoxylin and eosin staining and picrosirius red staining were prepared using standard protocols.

Serum analysis- Blood was obtained via puncture of the ear vein using heparinized tubes. Serum was separated by centrifugation at $9 0 0 ~ \mathrm { g }$ for 20minutes and stored at- $. 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ priorto biochemistry and amino acid analysis. Concentration of ALT, AST,and triglycerides was measured with a CL-8000 Hitachi 718O automatic biochemical analyzer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Tyrosine was quantified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using the ABI 320O Q TRAP LC-MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems,Foster City, CA,USA).

Allogeneic hepatocyte transplantation- Fresh hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type rabbit liversby in situ collagenaseperfusionas previously reported (47). Briefly, the liver was perfused with calcium-and magnesium-free Hank's Balanced salt solution(Thermo, Rockford, USA）supplemented with $0 . 5 \mathrm { \ m M }$ EGTA for 10 minutes and $1 0 \ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES for 3 minutes.The solution was changed to EBSS supplemented with $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l }$ collagenase IV (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA） for 10 minutes. The liver was then gently minced in the second solution and filtered through $1 5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } } , 7 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } } , 5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and $3 7 . 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ nylon mesh, sequentially. After centrifugation at $5 0 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ for 5 minutes, the pellet was washed with $4 . 5 \ \mathrm { \ g / m L }$ DMEM3timesat $5 0 ~ \mathrm { g }$ for2 minutes.The number and viability of cells was assessed by trypan blue. $1 0 ^ { 7 }$ viable cells were then incubated in a $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ DiI solution(Sigma, St Louis,MO,USA） for 5 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and for 15 minutes at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for labeling， and washedin $4 . 5 \mathrm { \textrm { ~ } } \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ DMEM. Eventually, $1 0 ^ { 7 }$ hepatocytes in $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ Clonetics?

Hepatocyte culture medium (Lonza,Walkersville, MD，USA） were injected into the spleen of recipientrabbitsviaasmall flankincision.

Concavalin A and Cyclosporin A were purchased from Sigma.
