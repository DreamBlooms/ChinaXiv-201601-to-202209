# InBrief

Viral receptorsare keyhost factors for virion entry; however, it is not known whether trafficking and secretion of progeny virus also requires host intracellularreceptors.Li etal. show that dengue virus (DENV) interacts with host KDEL receptors (KDELR) in the ER. Depleting KDELR,disrupting DENV/ KDELR interaction or blocking KDELR cycling between the ER and Golgi reduce virus release,resulting in virus accumulation in the ER.The authors propose that KDELR functions as intracellular receptors to assist in DENV exit from the ER.

# SUMMARY

Membrane receptorsat the surface of targetcellsare key host factors for virion entry;however, it is unknown whether trafficking and secretion of progeny virus requires host intracellular receptors. In this study,we demonstrate that dengue virus (DENV) interacts with KDEL receptors (KDELR)， which cycle between the ER and Golgi apparatus, for vesicular transport from ER to Golgi. Depletion of KDELR by siRNA reduced egress of both DENV progeny and recombinant subviral particles (RSPs). Coimmunoprecipitation of KDELR with dengue structural protein prM required three positively charged residues at the N terminus,whose mutation disrupted protein interaction and inhibited RSP transport from the ER to the Golgi. Finally, siRNA depletion of class Il Arfs，which results in KDELR accumulation in the Golgi，phenocopied results obtained with mutagenized prME and KDELR knockdown.Our results have uncovereda function for KDELR as an internal receptor involved in DENV trafficking.

# INTRODUCTION

Dengue，a mosquito-borne viral infection endemic in over 100 countries，is caused by four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4).Inadditiontoa febrile,influenza-like illness,severe dengue represents a public health concern in Asia and South America where it is a major cause of death across all ages (Guzman et al.,2010; Messina et al.,2014). Despite the global burden of disease,there isno specific treatmentand, therefore,amolecular understanding of host-pathogen interactions during the cellular life cycle is needed to guide the development of effective drugs (Guzman et al., 2010).

DENV has two structural glycoproteins: pre-membrane (prM) andenvelope (E) (Kuhn et al.，20o2)；E mediates interaction with cellular receptor(s) for viral attachment and entry (Chen etal.,1997),whereas prMassistsEin its correct folding(Courageot et al.,2ooO) and protects it from pre-fusion in the acidic environment of the secretory pathway (Zhang et al.,20o3). Assemblyof DENV occurs at the ER and requires interactionof prM and E (Mukhopadhyay et al.， 2005； Pryor et al.， 2004). Nascent virions bud into the lumen of the ER,accumulating in dilated cisternae oriented toward the cis-Golgi,and are translocated to the Golgi via traffickingvesicles (Welsch etal.,2009). In the trans-Golgi network (TGN)，prM protein is cleaved by the cellularprotease furin,resulting in the releaseof the prpeptide and formation of infectious DENV (Li et al.， 20o8；Yu et al., 2008).Besides mature virions,non-infectious recombinant subviral particles (RSP) can be produced by cells expressing DENV prME proteins (Mukhopadhyay et al., 20o5). Dengue RSP traffic along the same compartments as infectious DENV,and representasafeandconvenienttool for thestudyofvirus-host interactionsduringsecretion (Wang etal., 2009).

Although DENV egress has been studied for many years,most cellular targets identified in high-throughput screens have not been mapped to the secretory pathway (Sessions et al., 2009). Werecently identified two cellular factors，ADP-ribosylation factor4and5 (Arf4 and Arf5),which are involved in secretion of DENV progeny (Kudelko et al., 2012). Because Arfs play an important role in the recruitmentof coat proteinsnecessary for the formation of trafficking vesicles (D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier,20o6),our results indicate that $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ are acting at an early step of DENV secretion (Kudelko et al., 2012). The specific involvement of Arfs,which are dispensable factors for the constitutive pathway，in DENV traficking suggested that the virususesamore complexmachineryand that othercellular factors besides $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ might also assist to exit the infected cell.

Sorting of cargo is dependent on molecular recognition，a process equivalent to receptor-ligand interactions;however, it isnot knownwhether newly formed DENV exploits host factors to move along the secretory pathway. Intriguingly,depletion of $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ hasalso been reported to inhibit the retrograde trafficking of KDEL receptor (KDELR) from Golgi to ER (VolpicelliDaley et al.， 2005). The three KDELR members (KDELR1-3) identified (Hsu et al.， 1992;Lewis and Pelham， 1990,1992b; Raykhel et al.,20o7) are transmembrane proteins cycling between ER and Golgi apparatus to prevent leakage of ER-resident proteins,such as chaperones,and retrieve them back to the ER (Lewis and Pelham, 1990). As KDELR binding to cargo through a C terminus KDEL motif occurs only in the Golgi apparatus,we investigated their possible involvement in translocation of DENV from assembly and budding sites in the ER to the Golgi.

We show here that KDELR1 and KDELR2 play crucial roles for DENV1-3，but not DENV4 secretion.KDELR interacted with DENV through three positively charged amino acids at the N terminusof prM.DENV secretion could beblocked either bydepletion of KDELR,arrest of KDELR cycle,or disruption of prM/ KDELR interaction.Under these conditions，progeny DENV accumulated in the ER and did not reach the Golgi apparatus. Our results demonstrate that KDELRs function as luminal receptors for DENV transport along the secretory pathway.

# RESULTS

# KDELRInteractwithprMofDENV1

We previously demonstrated that depletion of $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ inhibited DENV1 and RSP release without disrupting constitutive secretion (Kudelko et al., 2012).To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism,we investigated the role of KDELRs,which accumulate in a peri-nuclear region and are not recycled back to the ER following $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ depletion (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005).All three KDELR identified thus far were detected by RT-PCR in our cellular models (Figure 1A).We observed a redistribution of KDELRincellsstablytransfected with prME (HeLaprME-DENV1)，with an apparent reduction of co-staining with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 in comparison to parental HeLa (Figure 1B).Moreover,partial co-localization of E and KDELR was observed in either HeLa-prME-DENV1 or Vero E6 cells infected with DENV1 (Figure 1C). Although a prominent aggregation of E protein was seen in HeLa-prME-DENV1 (Figure 1C), this did not reflect different distribution,as prME co-localized with ER marker in both cell lines (data not shown).Similar results wereobtained in cells co-transfected with DENV1 prME and KDELR1-RFP (Figure S1A). These observations suggested the participation of KDELRs in DENV1 life cycle.

We next performed co-immunoprecipitation (colP) using either dengue patient serum (DPS), containing antibodies recognizing prME (Kudelko et al.,2012),or normal human serum (NHS) as control. Pellets of colPs were analyzed with western blotting (WB)with antibodies recognizing either prMand E,or the three KDELR. prME glycoprotein was specifically pulled down by DPS,but not NHS (Figure 1D). Although expression levels were comparable,KDELR were detected only in pellets from HeLaprME-DENV1，but not parental cells (Figure 1D)．Similarly, when colP was performed with replication-competent DENV1, a strong signal for KDELR was visible only in pellets from infected Vero E6 cells (Figure 1E),confirming a biochemical interaction between KDELR and prME.KDELR were also precipitated from lysates of stable cell lines producing RSP of DENV2 and DENV3,but not DENV4 (Figure 1F),suggesting a certain degree of specificity between serotypes.

To investigate which portion of the envelope glycoprotein, prM orE,was responsible for interactionwith KDELR,the 4G2 monoclonal antibody，recognizing E but not prM,was used in colP assays. KDELR were not present in pellets obtained following incubation with the 4G2 monoclonal (Figure 1G), indicating that E was not responsible for interaction with KDELR.These observations were corroborated by detecting KDELR in colP pellets with the prM-6.1 monoclonal antibody,which recognizes prM but not E protein (Figure 1G).The biochemical interaction between prM and KDELR was further validated by colP in 293T cells co-transfected with prME and KDELR1-myc (Figure S1B). To conclusively define the role of prMand Ein the interaction with KDELR, weused two complementary approaches.First，glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins with truncated prM fragments were incubated with lysates of cells stablytransfected with KDELR1-myc. Pull-down assays showed that prM-△TM, the full-length protein without the transmembrane domain (130 amino acids)，pr fragment (91 amino acids) and the first 40 amino acids of prM sequence (pr4O) could all interact with KDELR (Figure 1H),revealing that the amino-terminal domain of prM was sufficient to mediate interaction with KDELR. Second,mature and immature RSP were used as baits to pull down KDELR from cell lysates. Immature RSP were produced in the presence of $N H _ { 4 } C l$ ,an inhibitor of furin,and thus contained full-length prM and E (Wang et al., 2009). Mature RSP were produced from immature RSPafter invitro cleavage by furin,which released the pr fragmentand, therefore,contained onlyEand M. KDELR could only be detected when immature,but not mature RSPwere incubated with HeLacell lysatesand then subjected to immune-precipitation (Figure 1l).These results demonstrate that interaction with KDELR was dependent on the N-terminal prfragmentof prM,as its release from immature RSPprevented pull-down of KDELR.

# KDELR Knockdown Reduces Secretion ofDENVRSP

To investigate the impact of the interaction between KDELR and prM on DENV1 life cycle,we transfected HeLa-prME-DENV1 cells that constitutively secrete RSP with siRNAs targeting all three KDELR; this resulted in an $8 1 \% \pm 4 \%$ $( \mathsf { n } = 3 )$ reduction of KDELR protein (Figure 2A). Silencing of KDELR did not affect cell viability,as determined by propidium iodide staining (Figure S2A),or morphology (Figure S2B).Our results show that depletion of KDELR had no effect on intracellular E protein expression,but significantly reduced RSP secretion (Figure 2A).

To test whether the effect of KDELR on RSP release was part ofa general mechanism that would interfere with the constitutive secretory pathway，we analyzed ssHRP release (Bard et al., 2006；Kudelko et al.，2012).No difference was observed in secreted ssHRP or intracellular HRPactivityafterdownregulation of KDELR or $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ ,when compared to controls (Figure 2B). In contrast, secretion of ssHRP-KDEL occurred only in cells treated with KDELR or $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ siRNAs,confirming that both manoeuvers had interfered with retrieval of KDELR to the ER,resulting in a parallel reductionof HRP activity in celllysates (Figure 2B).These

Figure 2. KDELR Knockdown Reduces SecretionofDENV1RSP

(A) HeLa-prME-DENV1 cells were transfected with siRNAs against all three KDELR isoforms,Arf4/Arf5 $( A r + 4 + 5 )$ ,andnon-targeting (NT).Knockdown efficiency was determined with WB.E protein in supernatants (SN)and cell lysates (CL) was depicted by WB，quantified by densitometry and RSPs secretion was expressed as the percentage of E protein detected in SN relative to the total amount $( \mathsf { S N + C L } )$ .GAPDH was used as the loading control across wells.Results are means $\pm \mathsf { S D }$ $\mathtt { \tilde { n } } = 3$ ,right). (B) KDELR downregulation did not inhibit constitutive secretion.HeLa cells expressinga secreted formof horseradish peroxidase (ssHRP) orssHRPKDEL were transfected with siRNAs targeting KDELR(gray）or $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ (black).Secreted and intracellular ssHRP horseradish peroxidase activity was measured in both SN and CL.Results are means $\pm$ SD $( \mathsf { n } = 3 )$ ：

(C) HeLa-prME-DENV1 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting KDELR either individually or in various combinations.SN and CL were analyzed by WB to assess RSP secretion (anti-E),release of chaperones (anti-Bip and anti-calreticulin)and knockdown of KDELR (KR-1O).GAPDH was used as the loading control across wells.Results are representative of three independent experiments. ${ \bf \ddot { p } } < 0 . 0 5$ ： $^ { \star \star } \mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 5$ versus control (NT) siRNAs.

results demonstrate that KDELR specifically assisted RSP releaseand their involvement was independentof perturbation of the constitutive pathway.

To study the role of individual KDELR on DENV1 secretion, siRNAs targeting individual KDELR were transfected into HeLaprME-DENV1 in various combinations.Although individual knockdowns of KDELR did not induce significant changes, KDELR1 $^ { + 2 }$ and KDELR1 $+ 2 + 3$ siRNAs drastically reduced RSP release (Figure 2C), indicating botha crucial role for KDELR1/KDELR2 and functional compensation between these two isoforms.

As KDELR depletion caused the release of KDEL-carrying proteins (Figure 2B), the effect on DENV1 secretion might have been simply due to shortage of chaperones, such as Bip and calreticulin,which are required fortheassemblyof DENV (Limjindaporn et al.，2009). This possibility wasexcluded byshowing that,although both proteins were detected in supernatants from cells treated with KDELR1 $^ { + 2 }$ and KDELR1 $+ 2 + 3$ siRNAs，their amount in cell lysates was not appreciably modified when compared to controls (Figure 2C). These experiments also show that only KDELR1 and KDELR2 were necessary for chaperones retention in the ER (Figure 2C), suggesting that KDELR isoforms assisting DENV1 secretion and retrieving ER-resident proteins were the same.Since KR10 antibody could not distinguish between the three KDELR (Figure 2C), the efficacy of siRNA targeting each isoform was independently verified in cells expressing tagged KDELR1-3 (Fig ure S2C) (Kudelko etal., 2012).

(A)KDELR knockdown reduced DENV1 virus titer.Vero E6 cells were transfected with KDELR siRNAs (gray) before being challenged with DENV1 $\left( \mathsf { M O l } = 0 . 1 \right) .$ .Non-targeting (NT,open) and $_ { \mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5 }$ (black) siRNAs served as negative and positive controls,respectively.Viral titers were measured at1,3,and5 days postinfection (p.i.). Results are means $\pm \mathsf { s D }$ $( { \mathsf { n } } \ = \ 3 )$ .SN were collected at 5 days p.i.and E protein was detected by WB (inset).

(D)KDELR knockdown inhibited secretion of DENV2 and DENV3,but not DENV4 progeny virus.Cells were treated as described in (A) and infected at an MOl of O.1.Progeny virus was measured at 5 days p.i.Results are means $\pm \mathsf { S D }$ of three to four measurements from one of two independent experiments with similar results. E protein in SN was detected in parallel by WB (inset). $^ { \star } \mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ $^ { \star \star } \mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 5$ versus control (NT) siRNAs.

Wenext investigated the effect of KDELR knockdown on replicative DENV1 in Vero E6 cells.At3 and 5 days post-infection, titers of progeny virus from KDELR-depleted cells were significantly lower than those of control cells (Figure 3A).A similar reduction wasalso found in cells treated with $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ siRNA (Figure 3A; Kudelko et al., 2012).Besides viral titers,a drastic reduction of E protein levels was detected in supernatants from cells treated with KDELR or $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ siRNAs (Figure 3A, inset). A significant decrease of DENV1 egress was also observed in KDELRdepleted cells challenged with different MOl (Figure 3B).In further experiments，Vero E6 cells were co-transfected with KDELR and $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ siRNAs before being challenged with DENV1.Measurements of progeny virus titer and E protein showed a similar inhibition in comparison to control cells (Figure 3C),suggesting that KDELR and $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ converged on the same pathway to interfere with DENV1 secretion.The efficiency of siRNA treatments was verified by WB (Figure S3A).We next tested in parallel the impact of KDELR silencing on all four DENV serotypes and observed a significant reduction of viral progeny titer for both DENV2 and DENV3,but not DENV4 (Figure 3D)，consistent with the finding that only DENV1-3 were able to interact with KDELRs (see Figure 1F). Control experiments confirmed that siRNA treatment did not affect cell morphologyand viability (Figures S3Band S3C).We then investigated the impact of KDELRs on egress of West Nile Virus (WNV)，another flavivirus transmitted by mosquito vectors (Campbell et al., 20o2) and found that viral progeny titer from KDELR-depleted cells was not different from that measured in controls $( 5 . 6 \pm 2 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ versus $6 . 7 \pm 1 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ ,respectively; mean $\pm \mathsf { S D }$ of ${ \mathsf n } = 6$ from two independent experiments).These results are in keepingwith our previous findings that different flaviviruses budding in the ER do not rely on the same cellular factors for intracellular traffic (Kudelko etal., 2012).

Finally,to exclude that the effect of KDELR knockdown on DENV1 egress was the consequence of changes in the early stages of the virus life cycle，we infected Vero E6 cells for 18 hr, less than the minimum time required for newly formed virions to be released from infected cells (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001).Our experiments show that similar amounts of viral RNA were measured in cells pre-treated with either KDELR orcontrol siRNAs (Figure S3D), indicating that KDELR knockdown had no effecton earlystages of the viral life cycle.

# prM/KDELRInteraction Occursinthe ER

Because KDELR are shuttling between ER and Golgi apparatus (Lewis and Pelham， 1992a; Raykhel et al., 2007),we designed experiments to ascertain in which compartment the prM/KDELR interaction occurred.We found that,in cells treated with $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ siRNA-,almost all KDELR signal was co-localized with GM130, whereas in controls only a small fraction exhibited co-staining with the cis-Golgi marker (Figure 4A).Therefore，we took (A) Depletion of $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ bysiRNA blocked retrieval of KDELR from Golgi. HeLa cells expressing KDELR1-RFP (red) were transfected with $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ siRNA and stained with anti-GM130 antibody (green).Non-targeting (NT) siRNA was used as control. Scale bar represents $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$

Figure 4.prM/KDELR Interaction Occurs in the ER

(B) KDELR sequestered in Golgi were not precipitated by dengue patient serum (DPS). HeLa-prMEDENV1 cells transfected with $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ or NT siRNAs were subjected to colP using DPS or normal human serum (NHS).Cell lysates (CL) and pellets from immunoprecipitation (IP)wereanalyzed by WB. Results are representative of three independent experiments.

advantage of this observation,which identifies the cis-Golgi as the peri-nuclear region where KDELR was sequestered following $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ depletion (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 20o5), to perform colP in $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ knockdown cells.Despite similar expression levels in all experimental conditions，KDELR could be precipitated only from control,but ot $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ depleted cells (Figure 4B), indicating that prM/KDELR interaction occurred in the ER.

# H2,R19,and K21AreKeyResiduesforprM/KDELR Interaction

To identify the putative region of prM interacting with KDELR,we analyzed the N-terminal sequence of the pr fragmentand noted a highproportion (seven of 26 residues)of positively charged amino acids (Figure 5A) that were conserved in DENV1-3 whereas substitutions at residues H2 and H11 were present in DENV4 (Figure S4A).To test the role of this cluster of basic residues we generated prME-DENV1 constructs with neutral amino acids substitutions (Figure 5A).Mutations did not affect expression of KDELR,prM,and E,with the exception of R6S,which reduced the levels of both viral proteins when compared to wild-type prME (Figure 5B,upper; and Figure S4B). Cell lysates weresubjected to colPand theabilityof mutant prMto interact with KDELR was determined by calculating the ratio between precipitated KDELR and prM，which was then normalized to that measured for wild-type prM (Figure 5B,middle). H2L,R6S, R19S,and K21T significantly reduced prM binding to KDELR (Figure 5B, lower) and release ofRSP (Figure 5C),demonstrating apositive correlation between prM/KDELR interactionand RSP secretion.

prM/E interaction is critical for the formation of DENV (Courageot et al., 2ooO):prM functions as the chaperone of E and its R6 residue is predicted to be important for both interactionand viral assembly (Li etal., 20o8).To test the effect of the mutated constructs on prM/E interaction,we performed colP assays on lysates of 293T cells and found that similar levels of prM protein could be precipitated forall mutants with the exception of R6S (Figure S4B).These observations,while confirming the predicted involvement of R6 (Li et al., 2oo8), demonstrate that none of the othermutated residues was involved in the interaction between prM and E.

Based on the results of colP (Figure 5B) and RSP secretion (Figure 5C)，we generated a triple mutant (H2L/R19S/K21T) designated hereinafteras“Triple.”The Triple mutation did not altertheabilityto bind $\mathsf { A r f } 4$ and Arf5 (Figure S5), but abrogated interaction with KDELRs (Figure 5D) and blocked the secretion of RSP by $90 \%$ (Figure 5E)，demonstrating the crucial role of H2,R19,and K21 residues for prM interaction with KDELR and DENV1 secretion.

# TripleMutant prMEFormsRSPandIsTranslocated within the ER

Toexclude the possibility that disruption of prM/KDELR interaction had compromised the assemblyand formation of viral particles，we performed freeze-and-thaw (F&T) experiments, which have been shown to release intracellular viruses from host cells (Burleson etal., 1992). Upon repeated cycles of F&T, cells expressing R6S released barely detectable levels of RSP (Figure 6A)，confirming that disruption of prM/E interaction inhibited RSP formation. In contrast, similar amounts of RSP were released from cells expressing either wild-type or Triple prME (Figure 6A),indicating that prM/KDELR interaction was dispensable for the formation of viral particles and further suggesting that inhibition of DENV1 and RSP release was the consequence ofa traffickingdefect.

Next,we studied the role of prM/KDELR interaction in RSP traffic within the ER by immunofluorescence microscopy of cells co-stainedwith anti-Eas well as antibodies labeling ER，cisGolgi and TGN. It has been observed that newly assembled DENV translocate within the ER to accumulate in dilated cisternae oriented toward the cis-Golgi (Welsch et al., 2009) and,therefore,we used E protein aggregation as an index of RSP traficking within the ER.Aggregates were found next to the Golgi apparatus in $50 \%$ of cells expressing either wild-type or Triple mutant prME,but were hardly observed in cells stably transfected with R6S(Figures 6B and 6C),suggesting that transport of newly assembled RSP inside ER lumen did not require interaction with KDELR.Similar aggregates were observed in DENV1-infected Vero E6 cells using either a polyclonal antibody against prME or the anti-E monoclonal antibody 4G2 (Figure S6).

# TripleMutantRSPCannotExitfrom ER

To investigate whether interaction with KDELR was required for DENV1 exit from ER,translocation of RSP to the cis-Golgi wasdeterminedbymeasuring the percentageof total E protein co-localized with GM130.We found that in cells expressing wild-type prME there was a significantly higher percentage of (A)Diagram highlighting positively charged amino acids (aa) clustered atthe N terminus of prM-DENV1. (B) Substitutions at H2,R6,R19,and K21 significantly reduced the ability of prM to bind KDELR in transfected 293T cells;wild-type (WT) and empty vector (ev) served as positive and negative controls, respectively.Cell lysates (CL）were subjected to colP using dengue patient serum (DPS).prM and KDELR were detected by WB in CL or IP pellets (upper). Densitometric ratios of precipitated KDELR/ prM are shown as means $\pm \mathsf { S D }$ $\mathtt { \tilde { I } } \mathtt { I } = 3$ lower).

E protein co-localized with GM-130 with respect to R6S,which does not form RSP and served as the negative control,and Triple mutant,which behaved indistinguishably from R6S (Figures 6B and 6D).Furthermore,similar results were obtained when colocalization of E protein with a TGN marker was measured, with R6S and Triple mutant exhibitinga $50 \%$ reduction with respect to wild-type prME (Figures 6B and 6E). These results indicate that RSP of Triple prME were not efficiently translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.

The involvement of KDELR in DENV1 exit from ER was further studied by monitoring intracellular dimerization of E protein. It has been reported that DENV glycoprotein prME undergoes a conformational change in the Golgi apparatus,possibly caused byluminal acidification,which leads to the formation of E homodimers (Li et al.,2008;Yu et al.,2008).RSP released by F&T showed that the percentage of E/E homodimers was 3- to 4-fold higher in cells expressing wild-type prME in comparison to Triple prME,whichbehaved in similar fashion to R6S (Figure 6F)，corroborating immunofluorescence observations (Figures 6B-6D).

Finally, because translocation from ER to Golgi is known to be mediated by vesicular transport (Antonnyand Schekman,2001), we investigated whether KDELR/prME interactionalso affected the formation of RSP-containing vesicles.Expression of the different prME constructs did not change the distribution of ERGIC53 (Figure 7A),which cycles between ER and Golgi (Schindler et al.,1993) and was used as marker of trafficking between these two organelles.RSP-containing vesicles (puncta costained with anti-E and anti-ERGlC53) were rarely detected in cellsexpressingTriple mutantorR6S prME,but readilyobserved with wild-type prME (Figure 7B).

# DISCUSSION

We provide here several lines of evidence to propose a role for KDELR in supporting the early steps of intracellular trafficking of both DENV1 and DENV1/RSP，namely their translocation from the ER to the cis-Golgi compartment. KDELR interact with DENV1 through three positive charged amino acids at the Nterminus of prM protein and DENV1/RSP egress is inhibited either by downregulation of KDELR,sequestration of KDELR in the Golgi,or by disruption of prM/KDELR interaction.Our results further indicate that interaction with KDELR is important for DENV1/RSP to be licensed as cargo of trafficking vesicles leaving the ER.Because KDELR were not required for constitutive secretion of soluble proteins,these findings demonstrate that intracellular transport of DENV/RSP is regulated by interaction withspecific cellular factorsand identifyKDELRasan essential component of this process.

The term receptor in virology refers to host plasma membrane proteins that recognize viral structural components,triggering receptor-mediated endocytosisof the bound pathogen (Mercer et al.，201O). The process of DENV transportation from ER to Golgi apparatus shares several similarities to viral entry.In both processes viruses can be viewed as cargo that is translocated froma neutral environment (extracellularmilieu or ER) to anacidic compartment (endosome or Golgi),needs to overcome a lipid membrane barrier to reach its final destination (cytoplasm

Many cellular factors have been shown to be crucial for DENV life cycle (Sessions et al., 2oo9),but viral-host interactions that assist in secretion of newly formed virions are still unclearand no host receptors mediating secretion of progeny virus are known.Thus，although one study suggested an indirect role of KDELR in early vaccinia virus biogenesis，by recruiting (A) Cells expressingwild-type (WT),Triple or R6S prME were co-stained with anti-E(green) and antiERGIC53 (red).Puncta labeledwith anti-Eand anti-ERGlC53 (arrows) were rarely detected in cells expressing Triple and R6S.Scale bar represents $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$

(C) Working model depicting the role of KDELR in DENV transport.Newly formed virions assembled in the ER exploit KDELR as luminal receptor to be sorted as cargo of vesicles that reach the Golgi, where they dissociate to allow KDELR to retrieve ERresident proteins and become available for morerounds of transport.The precise molecular events regulating interactions of DENVwith $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ and their final trafficking remain to be elucidated.

R6 disrupted interaction with E and prevented assemblyofRSP,whereas substitutions of H2，R19,and K21 abolished interaction with KDELR and perturbed RSPtrafficking.Sequence alignment shows that a similar cluster of positively charged amino acid is present in DENV1-3 serotypes,whereas DENV4 exhibits non-basic substitutions at residues H2 and H11.This difference correlates with the inability of DENV4 to pull down KDELRs and be affected by KDELR depletion.In keeping with our working model,we found that secretion of WNV, coatomer,their impact on intracellular transportwas not investigated (Zhang et al.，20o9).Similarly, the reduction of DENV2 replication associated with KDELR downregulation had been ascribed to decreased cell surface expression of protein disulphide isomerase，which has been proposed to function as an additional DENV receptor(Wan etal.,2012). Our data define a receptor role for KDELR in DENV egress,although it has to be acknowledged that depletion of KDELR in Vero E6 cells reduced viral titer by less than one orderof magnitude.Clearly,additional, compensatory factors mayassist trafficking of DENV from ERto Golgi，as indicated also by the lack of interaction between DENV4 and KDELRs.Further studies will be needed to identify intracellular receptors for DENV4aswell as forother flaviviruses.

It has been demonstrated that,on immature DENV,prM sits on top of E protein to protect it from the acidic environment along the secretory pathway (Zhang etal.,20o3).This topologymakes prM more accessible to interactions with host cellular proteins. However, the location of the key amino acid residues mutated inour experiments is different,with R6 facing E protein,while H2,R19,and K21 are positioned on the outside face (Li et al., 2008).This is consistent with our observation that mutation of which lacks a high proportion of positively charged amino acids at the Nterminus of prM protein,wasalso unaffectedby treatment with siRNAs targeting KDELR.As the acidic pH in the Golgi is closer to the p/ of positively charged amino acids,it is tempting to speculate that this environment may facilitate dissociation of prM/KDELR complexes by reducing their binding affinity.In contrast, the canonical KDEL motif is more negatively charged (Wilson et al.，1993) and this difference may underlie the cargo switching that allows retrieving of resident ER proteins from Golgi.

The finding that DENV4 was unaffectedby KDELR depletion was surprising.We had previously shown that release of DENV4 was inhibited by knocking down $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ (Kudelko et al., 2012),which would result in sequestration of KDELR in the cisGolgi and,therefore，reduce theiravailability forDENV4 trafficking. It is logical to postulate that DENV4 may interact in the ERwith an additional intracellular receptor in an $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ -dependent manner and be able to translocate along the secretory pathway even when KDELRs were downregulated.Thus,trafficking of flaviviruses may require a specific complement of factors for different viruses and/or strains.It should be pointed out that,although the Triple mutant was mainly localized in the ER, it was still able to pull down both Arf4 and Arf5,confirming that binding to $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ and KDELR in the ER are independent events. $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ are localized at both Golgi and ER (Duijsings et al., 2009) and may play two crucial roles for DENV secretion，by being involved in KDELR recycling and interacting with prM protein. Further experiments will be required to ascertain the precise location and role of class Il Arf/prM interaction in DENV trafficking.

The function of prM in DENVbiology isattractingmore attention.Thus,prM has been recently shown to interact with the light chain Tctex-1 of dynein and play a role in late stages of virus replication (Brault et al.,2011).We demonstrate here that prM interacts with KDELR during virus secretion.Our working hypothesis is that DENV1-3 use unoccupied KDELR,which are recognized by a binding motif in the N terminus of prM,to exit the ER as cargo of vesicles en route to the Golgi apparatus (Figure 7C).We had previously characterized the function of class Il Arf proteins in DENV/RSP egress (Kudelko et al.,2012). Simultaneous depletion of $\mathsf { A r f } 4 + 5$ efficiently sequester intracellular KDELR in the Golgi and, therefore,it is logical to postulate that both factors converge on the same pathway to inhibit DENV/ RSP secretion (Figure 7C).However,results with DENV4 and WNV suggest that additional host proteins are specifically involved in sorting flaviviruses through late secretory compartments and assisting their release from infected cells.In recent years,evidence has accumulated to suggest that,besides their well-established function in retrievingchaperones,KDELRcan be activated by cargo to trigger signaling pathways that regulate anterograde and retrograde traffic (Giannotta etal.,2012; Pulvirenti etal., 20o8). Specifically, it has been proposed that KDELRs recognize chaperones that are carried by ER vesicles en route to Golgi (Cancino etal.,2013). It is tempting to speculate, therefore, that during DENV1-3 biogenesis,newly formed virions bind to KDELR to activate cell signaling pathways that facilitate their translocation to the Golgi.

# EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

Cells,viruses,antibodies,and siRNA experiments are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.Primers used for RT-PCR,GST pull-down, and site-directed mutagenesis are shown in Tables S1，S2，and S3, respectively.

# ProteinAnalysisand RSPQuantification

Gel electrophoresis and WB analysis were carried outas previously described (Kudelko etal., 2012) To quantify RSP secretion, the areaand mean luminescence signals detected by WB in supernatants (SN) and cellular lysates (CL) were measured by densitometry using Image Quant TL (Thermo Fisher).For each condition,the relative amount of secreted RSP(E signal in SN) was calculated as the percentage of total signal $( E _ { \mathsf { S N } } / E _ { \mathsf { S N } } { + } E _ { \mathsf { C L } } )$

# VirusInfection Experiments

Viral stocks of DENV1-4 and WNV were titrated by determining the tissue culture infective dose $50 \%$ 1 $\mathsf { T C l D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathsf { m l } )$ in Vero E6 cells challenged with 10-fold serial dilutions of infectious supernatants for $9 0 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ Cellswere subsequently incubated in DMEM with $2 . 5 \%$ fetal calf serum.At 5-7 days postinfection for DENV1-3 and 3-5 days postinfection for DENV4 and WNV,culture supernatant was removed and cell monolayers were fixed in $4 \%$ formaldehyde.The percentage of cytopathic effects was used to calculate the viral titer.

For measurements of progeny virus production,viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatants and quantified by real-time RT-PCR (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).The amount of viral RNA transcripts was then calculated by generating a standard curve with 10-fold dilutions of RNA isolated from a known amount of DENV1 stock and expressed as $\mathtt { T C l D } _ { 5 0 } / \mathsf { m l }$ ,as described above.

# GST Pull-Down Assay

Fragments of the prM sequence of DENV1 were amplified by PCR (Table S2). Amplicons were subcloned in frame into the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T-1 to produce N-terminal tagged GST constructs (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).Twenty micrograms of each purified protein bound to sepharose 4B-glutathione beads was mixed with lysates of HeLa cells stably expressing cMyc-KDELR,incubated overnight at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ，andextensively washed before eluting bound proteins,according to the manufacturer's instructions,for WBanalysis.

# Coimmunoprecipitation

Sub-confluent monolayers of HeLa-prME-DENV1 or 293T cells transfected with the specified constructs were lysed on ice for 30 min with 1ml RIPA buffer, supplemented with freshly added 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitors cocktail. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 13,0o0 rpm for15 min at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with $3 0 ~ \mu \mu \mu$ of $50 \%$ protein G sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia) for 1hr.Pre-cleared lysates (400 ul) were then incubated for2 hr at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with additional $3 0 \mu \mu \up$ of $50 \%$ protein G sepharose beads previously treated with either specific antibodies or control IgGs.Beads were then pelleted by centrifugationat13,0o0 rpm for 30 s at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in gel loading buffer,separated by electrophoresisand analyzed with WB.

# Freeze-and-Thaw Assay

For subcellular fractionation (Xu et al.,1997),sub-confluent HeLa cells stably expressing either wild-type prME-DENV1 or the specified mutants were first detached in PBS plus $5 \mathsf { m M }$ EDTA at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 5 min and washed three times on ice with PBS supplemented with1 mM EGTA.Cells were then re-suspended inabuffer containing $10 \%$ wieght/vol sucrose, $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ Tris HCl,150 mM NaCl, $1 0 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ magnesiumacetate,1mMEGTA $\left( \mathsf { p H 7 . 6 } \right)$ supplemented with freshly added 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitors cocktail,and then subjected to eightcycles of freeze (dry ice) and thaw $( 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ water bath),1 min each step. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by ashort (5 s) spin atmaximum speed inabench-top centrifuge at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .Supernatantswere collected and centrifuged for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at maximum speed at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to pellet the membrane fraction.The final supernatants,containing newly formed RSP,were analyzed with WB.

# Fluorescence Microscopy

For fluorescence microscopy,cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed, permeabilized,and incubated with primary antibodies (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Samples were then probed with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (both from Life Technologies).Nuclei were stained with DAPl and coverslips were mounted on glass slides for image acquisition using either an Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope or an LSM 700 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).

# Quantitative Analysisof Fluorescent Images

Toextract and quantify cells stained with the viral E protein,we developed aspecific protocol，“Stained cells,” in the ICY software (http://icy. bioimageanalysis.org)(de Chaumont etal.,2012).To extract and quantify cells that contained RSP aggregates,we developed a separate protocol,“Cells with aggregates,"in the ICY software.Details of these protocols are provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

To determine RSP localization in the Golgi apparatus,weighted co-localization coefficients of E with Golgi markers were computed using the ZEN2011 co-localization coefficient software (Carl Zeiss).The sums of intensities of pixels corresponding to anti-E(So) and to co-staining with anti-E and either cis-Golgi or TGN marker (Sc) were computed and then weighted co-localization coefficients,which are equal to the ratio of Sc to So,were used to represent the percentage of RSP translocated to either cis-Golgi or TGN. Todetermine the number of RSP-containing vesicles,we manually counted (in blind) puncta co-labeled with anti-E and anti-ERGlC that were adjacent to perinuclear E-staining.The total number of double-labeled puncta per field was then calculated,divided by the number of cells expressing E protein and displayed as the number of puncta per cell.Data sets for quantitative analysis were acquired from anaverage of 40-50 fields from four to five independent experiments for each condition.
