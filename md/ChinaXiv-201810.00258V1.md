Abstract: Due to the advantages of scanning speed and high sensitivity,ESI-Q-TOF-MS is widely applicated to identify the chemical composition of traditional Chinese medicine.In addition,ESI-Q-TOF-MS can provide the precise mass number and possble element composition of fragmentation ions. Therefore,it can accurately evaluate the quality of salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) in different areas of Shaanxi province and provide the basis for quality control of Danshen. An direct injection ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis method was developed to value the chemical composition in Danshen coming from Shangzhou, Luonan,Dali,Danfeng and Tongchuan in Shanxi province.Through analyzing the MS abundance of water soluble and lipid soluble extracts,there is a obvious variation in chemical composition.The comparison among different abundance is benefit to select the optimum planting area ofDanshen.Results show that all Danshen samples from 5 diffrent locations have 9 kinds of lipid soluble chemical composition (Tanshinone I， TanshinoneIIA， TanshinoneIIB, Cryptotanshinone, Dihydrotanshinone,Danshenxinkun A,Danshenxinkun D,2-Isopropyl-8 -methylphenanthrene-3,4-dioneand 7-beta-hydroxy-8-13-abietadiene-11,12-dione)and 9 kinds of water soluble chemical composition (Danshensu, Caffeic acid,Ferulic acid,Rosmarinic acid,Prolithospermic acid,Lithospermic acid,Protocatechuic acid, Salvianolic acid Aand Salvianolic acid B).The content of Danshensu, Lithospermic acid,Salvianolic acid Band Cryptotanshinone is higher than other chemical composition with a MS abundance of $30 \%$ at least. However, with the change of planting environment,the content of the same chemical constituents in Danshen varies greatly in different regions.Tanshinones with important biological activity more exist in Danshen coming from Shangzhou, especially the MS abundance of Tanshinone Iis as high as $7 2 . 6 \%$ ,which is much higher than that in other 4 regions ranging from $1 . 8 \%$ to $1 1 . 3 \%$ . According to the comprehensive comparison, the quality of Danshen is ranged by Shangzhou $>$ Tongchuan $>$ Dali> Luonan> Danfeng. The direct injection ESI-Q-TOF-MS method is not easily afected by the growth environment and extraction conditions of the medicinal materials.It provides a scientific,reliable and convenient way to evaluate the medicine quality and anew way to formulate the specifications and grades of traditional Chinese medicine.The system is not only suitable forthe chemical composition of Danshen in Shaanxi province,but also easily transplanted and popularized in other Danshen planting places.

The dry root and rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (red sage, family Labiatae), known as “Danshen” in Chinese (Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, 2015), is widely used as medicine in China and the neighboring countries for hundreds of years.The extracts are important in clinic medicine preparations, especially in the traeatment of cardiovascular diseases (Feng et al, 2O17). Danshen also has a good therapeutic effect on atherosclerosis (Zhao et al, 2016),myocardial ischemia (Qin et al, 2014)and hepatic fibrosis (Wang et al,2017). It is also benefit for emarkable function on scavenging free radicals because of its secondary metabolites, such as the well-studied active ingredient Salvianolic acids and Tashinones in the classical phytochemistry research (Roberts et al, 2007). However, the composition of Danshen vary with different regions, in order to ensuring material quality and clinical efficacy, it is urgent to look fora scientific，reliable and convenient identification method to compare the chemical composition in different regions.

Danshen has been cultivated widely in different areas (Tongchuan, Dali, Danfeng, Luonan and Shangzhou) in Shaanxi province in China. It is well known that soil, climatic,planting pattern and extraction methods can cause a change in the contents of these components in Danshen. Many methods has been researched as qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of chemical components, such as HPLC (Zhang et al， 2017)，LC-MS (Liang et al, 2018), UPLC-MS (Chen et al, 2017)，CE (Wang & Duan，2014)，NMR (Zhang et al，2017), LC-DAD-MS (Hermund et al, 2018). However, it is regrettable that seldom mentioned on comparing the difference of chemical characteristics in Danshen in Shaanxi province.

In this study,with the expectations of providing a convenient quality control method for Danshen, the direct injection ESI-Q-TOF-MS technology was used to detect 18 chemical compounds present in all the samples of Danshen coming from five different locations,and most of them contain primary medicine benefits. The abundance value in MS is rather different among each composition and the same component in different locations under the same conditions. Through comprehensive analysis,there are four components can be seen as potential markers carrying on quality control in direct injection ESI-Q-TOF-MS method. The system is not only suitable for the chemical composition of Danshen in Shaanxi province, but also easily transplanted and popularized in other Danshen planting places.

# 1. Materials and methods

# 1.1 Material and Reagents

HPLC grade methanol was purchased from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; Deionized water was purified by a Mili-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA); ethanol was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., LTD.

All the root of annual Danshen were collected from Tongchuan, Dali, Danfeng,Luonan and Shangzhou of Shaanxi province in China in September 2016.

# 1.2 Sample Preparation

Alcohol Extract: The roots were smashed after fully dried through a warm air $( 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ,and then sieved through a no.6O mesh.Each of the fine powdered samples $( 1 . 0 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { g } )$ was accurately weighed and extracted with $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ethanol for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ using microwave method. After cooling,the extracting solution was filtered through a paper filter and ethanol was removed by reduced pressure distillation. The evaporated residue was dissolved in methanol and made up to volume in a $5 . 0 \ \mathrm { m L }$ volumetric flask.The solutions were filtered through a membrane filter $( 0 . 4 5 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ and then injected into the ESI-Q-TOF-MS directly.

Water Extract: The roots were smashed after fully dried through a warm air $( 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ，and then sieved through a no. 6O mesh. Each of the fine powdered samples $\left( 1 . 0 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { ~ g } \right)$ was accurately weighed and extracted with $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ water for $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ in a $9 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ water bath. After cooling, the extracting solution was centrifuged at $1 2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { r m p }$ for $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ，and then removed water by freeze drying. The crude extract solution was made up in a certain concentration in water with $0 . 5 \mathrm { m g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ , and filtered through a $0 . 4 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ membrane filter.

# 1.3 Instrumentation and analytical conditions

All analytes were performed on a Bruker micrOTOF-Q II ESI-Q-TOF-MS system in tune low method. Sodium formate solution was used as a calibration standard liquid in Enhanced Quadratic model. The sample injection volume was $1 0 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ and detected in tune_low method from $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m / z }$ to $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m / z } }$ .The capilary parameters were set to $4 0 0 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ for alcohol extract samples and $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { V }$ for water extract samples.Nebulizer pressure was set to O.4 Bar. Carrier gas is nitrogen and helium, which has dry gas flow rate of $4 . 0 \mathrm { L } \cdot \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ and dry heater at $1 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Samples of Danshen, which were extracted from different locations in Shaanxi Province, were prepared as described before.A volume of $1 0 . 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of filtered solution was injected into the instrument directly and each sample was determined parallelly three times.

# 1.4 Data analysis

The chromatographic data were recorded and processed with a Bruker Compass DataAnalysis 4.O software.The ion abundance refers to the ion signal strength which was taken as the vertical coordinate in the standard apectrum. The ion abundance at the peak of ionic

strength is set to be $100 \%$ in specified charge ratio,and the ratio between other ionic peak strength and the maximum peak strength is the ionic abundance at each peak.

$$
A = \frac { I } { I _ { \mathrm { m a x } } } { \times 1 0 0 \% }
$$

A is the ion abundance, I is the ion strength, $\mathrm { { I } _ { \mathrm { { m a x } } } }$ is the ion strength of the maximum peak .

# 2. Results and Discussion

ESI-Q-TOF-MS parameters such as fragmentor, spray pressure and capilary voltage which can influence the ion peak of corresponding molecular and the relative abundances were optimized for detecting to alcohol extract and water extract of Danshen.Fig.1 is a typical direct injection ESI-Q-TOF-MS spectrum.

There were altogether 18 known chemical composition obtained from the fragment ions information which effectively reflect the structures (Fig.2) of Danshen composition.

Fig.2 Chemical structures of components in Danshen detected by direct injection ESI-Q-TOF-MS

The spectrums showed concrete MS analysis results and 18 compounds were identified (Table 1).In the positive ion mode, the adduct ion of $\mathrm { [ M + N a ] ^ { + } }$ was the mainly observed peaks. For instance,peak at $\mathrm { m } / \mathrm { z } \ 3 1 7 . 1 1 2 8$ corresponded to the molecule of Tanshinone IIA with the adduct ion of $[ \mathrm { M } \mathrm { + N a } ] ^ { + }$ . In the negative ion mode,the adduct ion of[M-H]-is observed as common fragment peak, for example,peak at $\mathrm { m } / \mathrm { z } 7 1 7 . 1 5 4 0$ was the molecule of salvianolic acid B. It is nearly uniform in compounds classification among Danshen samples from five locations, but a greater distinction was existed in some specific composition.

Combined predecessor's work (Pan et al 2Oo2),the special fragmentation of Tanshinone I A as a representative lipophilic components was displayed in Fig.3. Tanshinone IA lost neutral molecular fragments ${ \mathrm { . C H } } _ { 3 }$ ， $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ and -CO to form the peak at $\mathrm { m } / \mathrm { z } ~ 3 0 3 . 1 2 3 7 , ~ 3 0 0 . 1 0 3 2$ and 289.1124.Fragment peak at $\mathrm { m } / \mathrm { z } 2 8 5 . 1 3 8 3$ was obtained not only by losing a $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ molecule from $\mathrm { m } / z \ 3 0 3 . 1 2 3 7$ ，but also via splitting a molecule ${ \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { C H } _ { 3 }$ from the fragment $\mathrm { m } / z \ 3 0 0 . 1 0 3 2$ which can split into fragment $\mathrm { m / z } \ 1 9 5 . 0 4 4 1$ and 272.1162. In brief, the fragmentation of Tanshinone II A occurred through a loss of neutral small molecular fragments $\mathrm { - C H } _ { 3 }$ ，-CO, $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ and so on.

Fig.3The fragmentation process of Tanshinone IIA by the adduction of $\mathrm { [ M + N a ] ^ { + } }$

Through the abundance analysis， it varied quite drastically among the 18 chemical composition from five locations at the same conditions.The reason for the variation might be due to different planting environment.

For lipid solute components of Danshen from five different locations (Table 2,Fig. 4), it is obvious that the abundance of some chemical composition， such as Tanshinone I, Cryptotanshinone, Danshenxinkun A and Danshenxinkun D,varied greatly with the change of Danshen planting area. Danshen from Shangzhou had overwhelming superiority in the content of Tanshinone I, Danshenxinkun A and Danshenxinkun D with the abundance value of $7 2 . 6 \%$ $100 \%$ and $100 \%$ . The difference gap between the maximum and the minimum value were

$70 . 8 \%$ ， $9 6 . 0 \%$ and $9 6 . 1 \%$ respectively.At the same time, Danshen from Tongchuan owned the most Cryptotanshinone with a value of $100 \%$ , followed by $6 3 . 8 \%$ in Danfeng.

Compared to the previous, other five lipid solute components don't possess big difference gap or obvious abundance degree. It is alike among the trends among Tanshinone I A, TanshinoneIB， Dihydrotanshinone,2-Isopropyl-8-methylphenanthrene-3,4-dioneand 7 $\cdot \beta$ -hydroxy-8-13-abietadiene-11,12-dione. They respectively reached the maximum abundance value of $20 . 7 \%$ (Dali), $7 . 5 \%$ (Dali), $3 2 . 1 \%$ (Dali), $6 . 2 \%$ (Shangzhou) and $1 6 . 7 \%$ (Tongchuan).

In brief, the abundance value of Cryptotanshinone was the highest in all samples,the followed was Danshenxinkun A with a range from $4 . 0 \%$ to $100 \%$ ，and other lipid solute componentsalso ownedgood abundance response except TanshinoneIBand 2-isopropyl-8-methylphenanthrene-3,4-dione. The rank of the content of lipid soluble components in five regions is Shangzhou $>$ Dali $>$ Tongchuan $>$ Luonan $>$ Danfeng.

Fig.4Abundance comparison on lipid chemical components in Danshen

For water solute components of Danshen from five different locations (Table 2,Fig.5), the tendency of abundance variation is nearly the same.All samples contain more Danshensu, Lithospermic acid, Prolithospermic acid and Salvianolic acid B than other chemical components. The four components reached the respective maximum abundance value of $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ (Shangzhou & Tongchuan), $1 0 0 . 0 \%$ (Luonan), $5 1 . 9 \%$ (Shangzhou） and $6 5 . 1 \%$ (Luonan). It was well to be reminded that Danshensu and Lithospermic acid had a higher abundance signal response with a value more than $45 . 0 \%$ ,and abundance gap ( $5 5 . 2 \%$ for Danshensu, $4 1 . 6 \%$ for Lithospermic acid) was obvious from the maximum to the minimum value. In the meantime, Ferulic acid, Rosmarinic acid and Salvianolic acid A showed nearly the common variation tendency with low abundance value.They reached the maximum of $6 . 6 \%$ ， $6 . 5 \%$ and $1 5 . 9 \%$ in Danshen from Shangzhou. There was no obvious distribution in different regions.

Salvianolic acid B is important as active medical component in clinic.Danshen from Luonan owned a highest abundance value of $6 5 . 1 \%$ ，and the lowest level was also achieved a abundance value of $34 . 1 \%$ in Shangzhou.

In brief, the abundance value of Danshensu and Lithospermic acid were the highest in all samples, the followed is Salvianolic acid B with a range from $34 . 1 \%$ to $6 5 . 1 \%$ ，and other water solute components also owned good abundance response except Ferulic acid and Rosmarinic acid.The rank of the content of water soluble components in five regions is Shangzhou $>$ Tongchuan $>$ Luonan $>$ Dali $>$ Danfeng.
