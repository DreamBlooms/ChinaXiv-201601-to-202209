KEY WORDS hypoxic preconditioning; synaptic curvature; presynaptic mitochondria

ABSTRACT Hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) elicits resistance to more drastic subsequent insults,which potentially provide neuroprotective therapeutic strategy, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.Here,we examined the effects of HPC on synaptic ultrastructure in olfactory bulb of mice.Mice underwent up to five cycles of repeated HPC treatments,and hypoxic tolerance was assessed with a standard gasp reflex assay. As expected, HPC induced an increase in tolerance time. To assess synaptic responses,Western blots were used to quantify protein levels of representative markers for glia, neuron,and synapse,and transmission electron microscopy was used to examine synaptic ultrastructure and mitochondrial density.HPC did not significantly alter the protein levels of astroglial marker (GFAP),neuron-specific markers (GAP43,Tuj-1,and OMP)，synaptic number markers (synaptophysin and SNAP25) or the percentage of excitatory synapses versus inhibitory synapses. However,HPC significantly affected synaptic curvature and the percentage of synapses with presynaptic mitochondria,which showed concomitant change pattern.These findings demonstrate that HPC is associated with changes in synaptic ultrastructure.

# INTRODUCTION

Ischemic/hypoxic preconditioning(I/HPC) is defined as a sublethal hypoxic exposure that elicits tissue or organ resistance to a subsequent and more drastic ischemic or hypoxic insults (Murry et al.，1986). Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of HPC in multiple model systems,but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.

In the context of stroke,HPC has been shown to effectively protect neurons (Liu et al.,2ooO).Ischemic and hypoxic insults resulted in synaptic ultrastructural perturbations (Martone et al.,1999,Ito et al., 2006,Kovalenko et al.,2oo6).Considering that neuronal function and recovery after cerebral ischemia requires synaptic integrity (Murphy and Corbett, 2009),it is not surprising that modulation of synaptic responses plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of temporary and permanent cerebral ischemia.Is it possible that analogous alterations in synaptic ultrastructure and function may also contribute to the protective mechanisms of HPC? Olfactory bulb,part of brain,is rich of synapse and relevant to both HPC and stroke,which provides perfect target for current study. In this study,we used a model of repeated hypoxia-reoxygenation inmicetoexplorethe responses in synaptic markers and synaptic ultrastructure.Our findings suggest that independent of any detectable change in synaptic proteins,HPC induced significant changes in synaptic curvature,which is concomitant with mitochondria density variations.

# EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES Animals

Male ICR mice ranging from 21 to $ { 2 6 } \ \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ were obtained from Beijing Vital River Experimental Animal Co. (Beijing，China).Animals were separated into four groups,control,1-cycle,3-cycle,and 5-cycle HPC treatment groups.Each group contained 15-32 mice with 6 mice for Western blots and3 mice for transmission electron microscopy (TEM） analyses. Animals were randomly group-housed in a standard animal care room with the temperature $2 2 \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ，the humidity $5 0 \pm 5 \%$ ，and12-h light/dark cycle.Animals were acclimatized to the environment and provided with chow and water ad libitum.

# Hypoxic preconditioning

All procedures in this study were conducted according to the guidelines set by the University Animal CareandUse CommitteeofCapitalMedicalUniversity and were consistent with the NIH Guide for the care and use oflaboratory animals(NIHPublications No. 80-23). HPC mouse model was prepared as described with minor modifications (Zhang et al., 2011,Liu et al.,2012).End of each HPC was defined when the mouse presented gasp reflex.The $\mathrm { 1 2 5 - m l }$ Jar was replaced with a $\mathrm { 1 2 5 ~ m l }$ bottle with a screw cap,which guaranteedairisolation.

# Homogenization and Western blot

Olfactory bulbs (OBs） were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer and certain amounts of protein with loading buffer were boiled at $\mathrm { 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ for $5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ and subjected to $12 \%$ Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electropheresis(SDS-PAGE) (Liu et al., 201O).The antibodies dilutions were 1:500 for GAP-43 and GFAP (Santa Cruz，CA，USA)，1:2000 for synaptophysin (MBL, Nagoya, Japan)， 1:4000 for SNAP25 (BD Biosciences, San Jose，CA，USA)，OMP(WAKO，Richmond，VA, USA),and Tuj-1 (Abcam, Cambridge,UK) and 1:3000 for GAPDH(Sigma-Aldrich,Missouri, USA).

# Electron microscopy

TEM was performed as described previously (Xian et al.,2oo9).Anesthetized mice were perfused transcardially with physiological saline followed by $2 \%$ paraformaldehyde and $2 \%$ glutaraldehyde in $0 . 1 \mathrm { M }$ phosphate buffer $\mathrm { \langle p H ~ 7 . 4 \rangle }$ .Brains were removed and placed in $2 . 5 \%$ glutaraldehyde in the same buffer overnight. OBs were dissected transversely at $1 \mathrm { m m }$ thickness,rinsed in O.1 MPB,and post-fixed in $1 \%$ osmium tetroxide for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ . After rinsing in $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ PB,samples went through dehydration in degraded acetone solutions and embedded in Epon resin.Toluidine blue stained semithin $( 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m } )$ sections were used to localize neuron rich area.Ultrathin sections $\mathrm { 7 0 ~ n m } )$ were stained with uranyl acetate andleadcitrate.Pictures were recorded by TEM(FEI,TECNAI G220)with Gatan 894 CCD and analyzed with Gatan digital micrograph.The picture taken at a magnification of $\times 9 9 0 0$ was for synaptic density quantification; and magnification of $\times 2 6 { , } 5 0 0$ was set for synaptic ultrastructural observation.

# Synapse and mitochondria analyses

For synaptic density, both Gray type I (excitatory) and Gray type II (inhibitory）synapses were included. About 15-33 pictures were taken for each group.

For synaptic ultrastructure and mitochondrial density recording，only Gray Type I synapse was analyzed.About 112-154 pictures were analyzed for each group.Synaptic ultrastructure included synaptic perforation and synaptic curvature according to Petit's description (Weeks et al., 20o3). Convex means postsynaptic bouton protruded into presynaptic terminal, whereas protrusion of presynaptic terminal into postsynaptic bouton is referred to as concave.All synapses were analyzed by professional technician blind to sample information.

# Data analysis

All data were expressed as group mean $\pm$ standard error of the mean (SEM).Data from tolerance time, Western blots assay， and synaptic ultrastructure analyses were subjected to a non-parametric ANOVA followed by Tukey: compare all pairs of columns. Statistical difference was set at $P < 0 . 0 5$ ：

# RESULTS

HPC was performed by subjecting mice to repeated cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation (Fig. 1A).A standard gasp reflex assay demonstrated as HPC treatments increased,tolerance time increased significantly,which were shown in comparison between the first cycle in 3-cycle group(3C-1) and the third cycle in 3-cycle group (3C-3),and between 5C-1 and 5C-3. Especially when HPC treatments increased more,tolerance time increased even faster,which were shown in comparison between 5C-3 and 5C-5,and between 5C-4 and 5C-5 (Fig. 1B).

Western blots showed that HPC did not alter the protein levels of representative markers for glia (GFAP),neuron (GAP43),and olfactory neuron maturation (Tujl and OMP) (Fig. 2). Further studies focused on synaptic ultrastructure.There were no significant differences in synaptic density between control and HPC groups detected by TEM(Figs. 3A and 3B) and by Western blots assay of synaptic number markers,synaptophysin,and SNAP25 (Fig. 3C). HPC did not affect the percentages of Gray type I (excitatory） synapse and Gray type I (inhibitory) synapse,the percentage of synaptic perforations,or average perforation per synapse significantly (Fig. 4). However, further analyses of synaptic curvature revealed significant changes by repeated HPC treatment.3-cycle HPC treatment significantly decreased the percentage of flat synapses,while increased the percentage of convex synapses and sum of convex and concave synapses (Fig. 5).Concomitantly， the percentage of synapse with presynaptic mitochondria was significantly elevated by 3-cycle HPC treatment (Fig.6A). Interestingly, both synaptic curvature and mitochondria distribution changes returned to normal level after 5-cycle HPC treatment.A similar pattern wasobservedforaveragepresynaptic mitochondria number per synapse,but lack of statistical significance (Fig.6C).Neither percentage of synapse with postsynaptic mitochondria nor average postsynaptic mitochondria numberpersynapse showed any significant changes (Figs.6B and 6D).

Fig.3.Synaptic number is not affected by HPC.Synapse was illustrated with arrows in (A).Synaptic number was evaluated by TEM quantification with low magnification(A,B)and Western blots assay of synaptic number marker synaptophysinand SNAP25(C).Both statistical analyses showed consistently that synaptic number was not affected by HPC.For TEM,5-11 pictures were used for each mouse, $N = 3$ For Westernblot, $N = 6$ .SEM,standard errorof themean.

Fig.4.Synaptic type and perforation are not affcted by HPC.Both Gray type I(left) and Gray type II (right) synapses were recorded and shown (A),and their percentages were calculated $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { B } )$ ,which didn't present significant changes.Ratios of perforated synapse and average perforation per synapse showed decrease tendency as HPC treatments increased;however,the statistical analysis results were negative (B). $N = 3$ SEM,standard error of the mean.

# DISCUSSION

In this study, synaptic ultrastructural changes in mice by repeated HPC treatments were elaborately studied. Results showed that repeated HPC significantly affected synaptic curvature and concomitantly affected presynaptic mitochondrial density. These findings suggest that the effects of HPC were mediatedin part through synaptic ultrastructural changes.

HPC is part of a broad array of preconditioning and tolerance phenomena that is highly conserved throughout evolution.Various stimuli such as ischemia,hypoxia,hypothermia,and any conditions that cause stress may induce a preconditioned response (Gidday， 20o6).Interestingly，repeated HPC elicites tissue/organ resistance to subsequent more drastic ischemic/hypoxic insults,which can be divided into rapid and delayed tolerance,with protections developing from minutes to days (Shpargel et al.,2008). The mechanisms included immediate release of mediators,rapid post-translational modifications of preexisting proteins (Tsai et al.,2oo4),and activation of signal transduction pathway for de novo synthesization of protective proteins (Kamota et al., 20o9).However,synaptic response to preconditioning are rarely examined.

Instead of 3D-electron microscopy focusingon sophisticated ultrastructure of single synapse， we used conventional TEM to obtain ultrastructural information of many synapses.5-cycle HPC took only $2 7 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ ，which was far less than the synaptic turnover time of 3 days.Synaptic density is more stable during synaptic electrical activity, such as LTP (longterm potentiation） and LTD (long-term depression), which occurred within a short period.And it has been considered that the central nervous system typicallyutilized changes in synaptic ultrastructure other than synaptic number as primary means to modulate synaptic efficacy (Connor et al.，2oo6;Marrone and Petit, 2oo2). Similarly, we found significant changes in synaptic curvature instead of synaptic number by HPC treatment.

How changes in synaptic ultrastructure affect synaptic function is an area of ongoing study. Increased synapses with convex or concave shape were confirmed to be related with elevations in synaptic activity(Connor et al.，20o6，Medvedev et al.， 2010; Marrone et al.,2oo5).Furthermore,alterations in synaptic curvature could occur as quickly as $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ (Markusand Petit,1989),which provided theoretical support for the present study. In this study, 5-cycle HPC normalized synaptic curvature changes caused by 3-cycle HPC.If true,these rapid alterations in synaptic ultrastructure may require corresponding responses in energy utilization.Our results showed that,along with changes in synaptic curvature,the percentage of synapses with presynaptic mitochondria also changed.Thus,it is tempting to speculate that HPC triggers a coordinated set of energetic responses as part of endogenous homeostatic programs that allow synapses to adjust to subsequent insults.How these synaptic responses contribute to the beneficial induction of hypoxic tolerance and protective benefits of HPC warrants further investigation in future.
