Abstract: In order to deal with the quality of Antarctic krillduring the storage and transportation process caused by the failure of the supply system and the freezing equipment in the processof storage and circulation in the form of frozen products,the project team changed the refrigerated environment tothe Antarctic The effect of krill quality was studied.When the ambient temperature increased from $- 2 0 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ to $- 1 2 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C , - 7 ^ { \circ } C , - 3 ^ { \circ } C , - 1 . 5 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C , 0 ^ { \circ } C , 1 ^ { \circ } C } }$ $2 . 5 \mathrm { ~ \% ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ \mathring { C } , ~ } 4 \mathrm { ~ \tiny ~ \mathring { C } , ~ 6 ~ \mathring { C } ~ \mathrm { ~ , ~ 8 ~ } ~ \mathring { C } , ~ } 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { ~ \tiny ~ \mathring { C } , ~ } 1 6 \mathrm { ~ \tiny ~ \mathring { C } ~ }$ , the Antarctic krill samples for sensory evaluation, $\mathsf { p H }$ value, the meat rate and soup turbidity and other quality indicators of the determination.The results show that when the ambient temperature from $- 2 0 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ up to $\mathrm { - 1 . 5 ~ \ ^ { \circ } C }$ process, the Antarctic krill soup after cooking is more clear, little change in turbidity,pH quickly increased from 7.60 to 7.85 Antarctic krill muscle elasticity began to change Poor, the sensory quality has begun to change from good to change; when the temperature from $\cdot 1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ to $4 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , the pH value slowly increased,there is acertain fluctuation,may be due to diferences in thecompositionof the various components of the decision,Antarctic krill soup after the soup turbidity quickly increased from O.5 to 0.7Brix maximum, sensory quality is still at a moderate level; when the temperature rose to $1 6 ~ \mathrm { { ^ circ C } }$ , the pH has risen to 8.05, Antarctic krillSensory quality from the change intoabad,this time the Antarctic krill has beenunable to eat,only as a feed or other use.

Key words:Antarctic krill, quality, Ambient temperature

Due to the distance between the Southern Ocean and the processing technology, most of the Antarctic rill is transported by low temperature on board and transported to the designated location for sale or processing. However, in the storage,circulation process,the power supply system,frozen storage equipment failure caused by storage and transportation process changes in the ambient temperature is not uncommon.But also because of the special mechanism of Antarctic krill quality change mechanism,and endogenous protease in low temperature conditions also have highactivity,easilylead to Antarctic krillself-dissolving,black and other qualitydeterioration.There are scholars at home and abroadto study the diferent refrigerated or frozen temperatureon the Antarctic krill quality changes,but these studies are carriedout underconstant temperature conditions,and inthe experimental production and circulation proces,due to equipment failure caused bythe environment The temperature of alargefluctuations in the situation also occurred. Therefore,the simulation of power supply or freezing equipment failure and other emergencies,the determination of Antarctic krillsensory quality,pH,turbidity,the rate of meat and other indicators to study the environmental temperature changes on the qualityof Antarctic krill, Krill production and circulation process to provide reference data.

# 1 Materials and methods

Combined with the production practice, $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ before the experiment will be moved to $- 2 0 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ refrigerator Antarctic krillin reserve. After the start ofthe experiment, te refrigerator willbe poweredoff,and the storage temperature of Antarctic krill will increase from $- 2 0 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ to -12 ℃,-7 ℃, -3 ℃,-1.5 ℃,0 ℃,1 ℃, 2.5 ℃ At 4 ℃,6 ℃, $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } , 1 2 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } , 1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , we took some samples of Antarctic krill samples for sensory evaluation, $\mathrm { p H }$ value, meat rate and soup turbidity and other quality indicators.

Sensory evaluation

The sensory test selected six trained evaluators to form the sensory evaluation group. According to the scoring criteria(Table 1),the colorof the Antarctic krill the body surface,the muscle and the 5-minute odor and the soup were boiled at $9 0 \mathrm { ~ \textdegree C }$ For the evaluation of indicators,the indicators out of 1O points,O is divided into the worst quality.

# 2. Determination of pH

Take $1 0 \mathrm { g }$ (wet weight) Antarctic krill, tissue mashed,add $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of distilled water, immediately with pH / temperature measuring instrument.

3.Determination of the rate of meat

Weigh the individual integrity, no damage to the Antarctic krill $1 0 \mathrm { \ g } , 9 0 \mathrm { ‰ }$ water bath for $5 \mathrm { m i n }$ , called the quality of the Antarctic krill MD $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { g } )$ , stripped shrimp shell after the quality of Antarctic krill m (G), into the formula

(1) Calculate the meat rate.

$$
\mathbb { M } \mathrm { e a t ~ R e a t } = \frac { m } { M } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

4. Soup of turbidity $5 \mathrm { g }$ Antarctic krill $5 0 \mathrm { m L } 9 0 \mathrm { ~ \textdegree C }$ boiled 5 min after the soup, measured by sugar meter mthod.

# 2Results and Discussion

Antarctic krillquality changes,first manifested in the sensory traits; sensory analysis has a high sensitivity, can perceive a slight deterioration,is a varietyof physical and chemical and microbial means irreplaceable;the use of sensory indicators offood quality evaluation,with Simple,intuitiveand soon,is an important means to reflect the qualityoffood.In addition,the colorof aquatic products is an important indicatorof its quality,shrimpcolor is the most important factor affecting the purchasing power of consumers. Shrimp body surface contains mainly astaxanthin,hemocyanin,etc., with the storage time,the surface of the astaxanthin gradually oxidized by the oxygen in the air,so that the surface color gradually Green gray becomes grayand black and erythema,freshness drops.The smellof aquatic products is another important factor in the identification of its quality.Freshly caught aquatic products are unique to the fresh smell,but with thedecline in freshness,the decomposition and oxidation of the protein in the body willproduce iritating amine odor The Therefore,te freshnessof aquatic products and the sensory changes are closely related. In the study of the preservation of Antarctic rillin the preservation and preservation of preservatives and vacuum packaging, the same research methods were used.

Refrigerator after the power outage, the Antarctic krill storage temperature from $- 2 0 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ quickly rose to $\mathbf { \Sigma } _ { - 1 2 } \mathrm { ~ \mathcal ~ { ~ C ~ } ~ }$ ， can be seen from Figure 1,at this time Antarctic krill color,body surface,muscle,smelland soup sensoryquality changes Very little; temperature rise to $\mathrm { - 1 . 5 ~ \ ^ { \circ } C }$ when the Antarctic krill color slightly dark, there is a small amount of blackheads, muscle elastic slightly worse,after cooking a litle meat hanging in the soup,the sensory quality began to change from When the ambient temperature rises to $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the sensory score is less than 4,the Antarctic krillis black,the tissue is loose,the muscle elasticityis deteriorated,the soup becomes turbid aftercooking,and the sensory quality becomes poor.

Fig.1 Effect of ambient temperature change on sensory quality of Antarctic krill

According to the study ofDi Qiangan[1l, Hang Yujiel2] and so on,Antarctic krillis self-dissolving enzyme, which still has high activityat low temperature,so that protein,amino acid and otherdecomposition,pHrise,in this experiment with the temperature 2),the pHvalue of Antarctic krillincreased,the initial pH value increased rapidly,then there was a certain fluctuation,but the overal trend was rising,and the pH value rose from 7.60 to 8.05 at the end of krillcorruption.Therefore,the pH value can be used as an auxiliary indicator of changes in the quality of Antarctic krill.

We can use the sugar meter method to determine the amount of solid content in the soup to quantify the Antarctic krill soup after the turbidity of soup.Antarctic krillsamples with the temperature rise,time becomes soft,boiled soup turbidity willhave a certain change,ascan be seen fromFigure 2, with the temperature rise,Antarctic kril boiled Soup turbidity increases.At the beginning of the temperature rise, there was no meat in the soup and no turbidity. When the temperature rose to $\cdot 1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the turbidity of the soup increased by O.1 Brix,which was consistent with the above sensory evaluation of the Antarctic krill. When the temperature rises to $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the turbidity of the soup reaches a maximum of O.7 Brix.As the temperature increases,the turbidity ofthe soup is no longer increased (except $1 2 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ),and the sensory score of the Antarctic krill is below 5,To further verify that boiled soup can be used as an effective indicator of changes in sensory quality of Antarctic krill.

Fig.4 Effect of environmental temperature change on the meat rate of Antarctic krill

Antarctic krillstorage process, with the temperature rise, protein loss increased,the rate of meat should be a downward trend,and Figure 4,the meat rate but showedan increasing trend, which maybe due to the short time of the ambient temperature change, Manual peeling,affected by human factors,resulting in the results and experimental design at the beginning of the opposite.

# 3 Conclusion and Discussion

Due to equipment failure caused by the Antarctic krill from the frozen temperature,when the ambient temperature from $- 2 0 \mathrm { ~ \textdegree C }$ increased to $\mathrm { - 1 . 5 ~ \ ^ { \circ } C }$ process,the Antarctic krill soup after cooking is more clear, little change in turbidity, $\mathrm { \ p H }$ quickly by 7.6O liters Up to 7.85 Antarctic krill muscle elasticity began to deteriorate, the sensory quality has begun to change from good to change; when the temperature from $- 1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ up to $4 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，the $\mathrm { \ p H }$ value slowly increased,there is acertain fluctuation maybe due to In thecase of the diference inthe composition of each component, the turbidity of the soup of the Antarctic krill was increased rapidly from 0.5 to $0 . 7 \ \mathrm { B r i x }$ ，and the sensory quality was still at a moderate level. When the temperature rose to $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the $\mathrm { \ p H }$ The value has risen to 8.05,the Antarctic krillsensory quality from the change into a bad,this time the Antarctic krillhas been unable to eat,can only be used as feed or other. In the rate of meat,the whole process of meat rate change is not,did not appear before the experiment expected experimental phenomenon,it is possible because of the meat rate experiment shrimp shellstripping iscarried out manually,subject to human factors,So te experimental results are not obvious.
