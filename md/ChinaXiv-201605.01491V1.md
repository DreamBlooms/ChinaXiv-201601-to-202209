The prokaryotic mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a pressure-relief valve protecting the cell from lysing during acute osmotic downshock.When the membrane is stretched,MscL responds to the increase of membrane tension and opens a nonselective pore to about $3 0 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ wide,exhibiting a large unitary conductance of ${ \sim } 3$ nS. A fundamental step toward understanding the gating mechanism of MscL is to decipher the molecular details of the conformational changesaccompanying channel opening.Byapplying fusionprotein strategy and controlling detergent composition,we have solved the structuresof an archaeal MscL homolog from Methanosarcinaacetivoranstrapped intheclosedandexpanded intermediate states.The comparative analysis of these two new structures reveals significant conformational rearrangements in the different domains of MscL.The large changes observed in the tilt angles of the two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) fit well with the helix-pivoting model derived from the earlier geometric analyses based on the previous structures.Meanwhile,the periplasmic loop region transforms from a folded structure,containing an @-shaped loop and a short $\mathfrak { \textbf { \beta } }$ -hairpin, to an extended and partly disordered conformation during channel expansion.Moreover,a significant rotating and sliding of the N-terminal helix (N-helix) is coupled to the tilting movements ofTM1 and TM2.The dynamic relationships between the N-helix and TM1/TM2 suggest that the N-helix serves as a membraneanchored stopper that limits the tilts of TM1 and TM2 in the gating process.These results provide direct mechanistic insights into the highly coordinated movement of the different domains of the MscL channel when it expands.

echanosensitive channels(MSCs) are a fundamental class to mechanical stimuli originating from external or internal environments.Theyare widespread inanimals,plants, fungi,bacteria, and archaea,with crucial functions in adaptation and sensation(1, 2).MSCs may share a common principle enabling them to transduce mechanical forces into electrochemical signals (3),although the divergent evolution of mechanosensitive channels has led to highly diverse protein sequences and different overall architectures among them (4). In animals,the sensations of touch and hearing require the functions of MSCs (2).Malfunctions of MSCsare associated with diseases like cardiac arrhythmias,hypertension, neuronal and muscle degeneration,polycystic kidney disease,etc. (5).In plants,the MSCs protect plastids from hypo-osmotic stress of the cytoplasm (6).In bacteria,they fulfill functional roles as emergency valves and protect cells from acute hypotonic osmotic stress in the environments (7,8).When challenged by acute osmotic downshock,Escherichia coli cells lacking large-conductance and small-conductance MSCs(MscL and MscS) will have their membrane ruptured, resulting in cell lysis (9).

As one of the two main classes of microbial mechanosensitive channels (MscL and MscS;the MscS family includes MscS, MscK,MscM,etc.),MscLhas the largestconductance (at ${ \sim } 3 \mathrm { n S }$ 0 at the fully open state and gates at the highest pressure threshold near the lytic limit of the cell membrane (1O).Since it was originally identified in1994(11),MscL has been well recognized asa model system for studying the molecular basis of mechanosensation through electrophysiology,biochemistry,genetics,structural biology,and molecular dynamic simulation approaches (12). Pioneering works demonstrated thatMscL can be converted into a light-activated nanovalve useful for the triggered release of compounds in liposomes (13-15).Recent studies suggest that the open pore of MscL permits entry of streptomycin and could potentially serve as a target for antimicrobial agents(16,17).

The gating process of MscL involves large conformational changes when it transits from the closed state to the open state through several intermediates (18).In the open state,MscL dilates its central pore to $\sim 3 0 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ wide and becomes permeable to water, ions,metabolites,and even small proteins(19-21).To describe the gating-related structural changes of MscL,an iris-like open-state

# Significance

Mechanosensation underlies fundamental biological processes, including osmoregulation in microbes, touch and hearing in animals,and gravitropism and turgor pressure sensing in plants. The microbial large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL) functions as a pressure-relief valve during hypoosmotic shock. MscL represents an ideal model system for investigating the molecular mechanism of the mechanical force transduction process. By solving and comparing the structures of an archaeal MscL in two different conformational states, we have revealed coordinated movements of the different domains of the MscL channel. Through this study, direct insights into the physical principle of the mechanical coupling mechanism，which co ordinates the multiple structural elements of this highly so phisticated nanoscale valve, have been established.

model was proposed based on computational modeling(22） and disulfide cross-linking data (23).This model was verified and revised by further studies through electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy(24) and an electrostatic repulsion test (25).More recently, astudy through the native ion mobility-mass spectrometry demonstrated thatMscL has the inherent structural flexibilityto achieve large global structural changes in the absence of a lipid bilayer (26).

Foran accurate characterization of the gating-related structural dynamics ofMscL,it is essential to solve and perform quantitative analyses on the structures of MscL trapped in various conformational states.Previously，crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis MscL (MtMscL) in the closed state (27) and Staphylococcus aureus MscL (SaMscL,△95-120 mutant) in the expanded intermediate state (28)were solved in homopentameric and homo-tetrameric forms,respectively.These two structures adopt funnel-shaped pores that are wide open at the periplasmic side and constricted at a narrow hydrophobic region near the cytoplasmic surface.The pore lumens are mainly lined by the first transmembrane helix(TM1） and flanked by the second transmembrane helix(TM2) at the peripheral region facing the lipid bilayer.Comparison of the two structures revealed a dramatic pivoting movement of the transmembrane helices during transition from the closed state to the expanded intermediate state (28).Nevertheless, the oligomeric state discrepancy and species difference between the closed (pentamer) and the expanded intermediate (tetramer） MscL structures raised questions that need to be further addressed (29,30).It wasreported previously that the tetrameric state of SaMscL may arise from the detergent-dependent behavior and the protein exists mainly in the pentameric form under in vivo conditions (29,30). Thus,a curious and pressing question emerges about whether the expanded-state conformation observed in the tetrameric SaMscL also occurs in the pentameric form.More importantly,it is largely open about how different parts of MscL cooperate with each other to achieve concerted movements (within each subunit and between subunits) during its gating process.The principles governing the mechanical coupling of the gating elements (TM1 and TM2) and the accessory parts (Nterminal helix,periplasmic loop,and C-terminal helix) of MscL are yet to be established.To this end,we have successfully solved thestructures of a MscL homolog from Methanosarcina acetivorans(MaMscL）in the closed and expanded states.Both structures are in homo-pentameric form and thus yield bona fide comparative studies showing the dramatic structural changes of MscL between the two distinct conformational states.

# Results and Discussion

Fusion Approach for Enhancing the Crystallizability of MscL.MscL has relatively small or minimal hydrophilic regions on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic surfaces.This feature is generally unfavorable for the formation of stable packing in the crystal lattice when the hydrophobic surfaces are covered by detergent micelles.As a stretch-activated channel,its inherent flexibility makes it highly sensitive to the changes of surrounding environments,either in the membrane or in detergent micelles.The conformational and oligomeric-state heterogeneities of a MscL sample purified in detergent solutions (29-31) further reduce the chance of obtaining well-ordered crystal samples suitable for structural studies.To overcome these problems and enhance the crystallizability of MscL,a pentameric soluble protein named riboflavin synthase(MjRS,fromMethanocaldococcus jannaschii) wasfused to the carboxyl terminus of a MscL homolog from M.acetivorans (MaMscL exists as pentamers on the membrane or in detergent solutions, Fig.S1A). The MaMscL-MjRS fusion protein purified in two different types of detergent solutions was crystallized in different space groups with distinct crystal packing modes as shown in Fig. S1 B-G.

Dothe MaMscL-MjRS fusion proteins form functional channels as the one without fusion protein attached? First, the two structures of MaMscL-MjRS solved in different space groups demonstrate that the MaMscL portions do form correctly assembledchannel architecturesand retain the flexibilityto adopt two drastically different conformations (Fig.1A).The C-terminal region of MaMscL and the N-terminal part of MjRS serve as a flexible linker ready to stretch when MaMscL changes its conformation. Second, it was previously shown that the introduction of polar residues to the pore constriction area ofEcMscL,such as G26H mutation, confers a severe gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype to the cells expressing the leaky mutant channel (32).The Gly26 residue is conserved in MaMscL and the G26H mutant of the nonfusion MaMscL does exhibit a GOF effect,although slightlymilder than thatofEcMscL-G26H(Fig.1B).Similarly, the G26H mutation on the MaMscL-MjRS fusion protein poses a GOF phenotype resembling that of the nonfusion MaMscL. Thereby,it is confirmed that the MaMscL-MjRS does form a functional channel on the cell membrane as the nonfusion MaMscL. Fusion of MjRSto the C-terminal end of MaMscL does not interferewith the assemblingofMaMscL intoa functional channel on the membrane.Third, the wild-type MaMscL is active,but not as good as EcMscL in rescuing the MJF465 cells during the osmotic downshock(Fig.1C).Its single-channel conductance $( 0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n S } )$ is significantly smaller than that ofEcMscL $( \sim 3 \mathrm { n S } )$ (Fig. $1 D$ and $E$ ） Fusion of MjRS to MaMscL further reduces its conductance to 0.10-0.15 nS (Fig. S1 $H$ and $I$ ).Asaresult,the MaMscL-MjRS fusion protein displayed a loss-of-function phenotype during osmotic downshock(9)(Fig.1C).Therefore,the MjRS protein either serves as a flow restrictor below the open channel or prevents the channel from achieving a fully open state during the osmotic downshock.The fusion of homo-pentameric MjRS with MaMscL not only provides a large hydrophilic scaffold to mediate intermolecule contacts in the crystal lattice,but also contributesto the stabilization of the MaMscL channel intwo discrete conformational states.

Structures of MaMscL Trapped in the Closed and Expanded States. Within the two crystal forms,the structures of MaMscL portions aredramaticallydifferent from each other,whereas the MjRS parts of the fusion proteins are nearly identical in their overall structures (Fig.1A).The MaMscL structure solved in Form 1 crystal aligns well with the closed-state MtMscL structure (Fig. $S \dot { 2 } A { - } C )$ ,whereas the other structure solved in Form 2 crystal resembles the expanded intermediate-state structure ofSaMscLC△26 (Fig. $S 2 \bar { D } { - } F _ { , }$ ).The values for the pore radii around the constriction sites,the tilt angles of TM1 and TM2,and the crossing angles of $\mathrm { T M 1 - T M 1 ^ { \prime } }$ (TM1 from the adjacent subunit) helices or TM2-TM2'helices have been extracted from the two pairs of MscL structures and summarized in Table S1 for a quantitative comparison.These data clearly demonstrate that MaMscL in Form1 crystal is in the closed-state conformation as the MtMscL structure,and the other one in Form2 crystal is in the expanded conformation as the SaMscL-C△26 structure.

The closed-state MaMscL structure has a very narrow hydrophobic constriction site with a pore radius at $1 . 2 \mathrm { \AA }$ (Fig. S2C), a small TM1 (or TM2) tilt angle of $3 7 ^ { \circ }$ (or $2 4 ^ { \circ }$ ),andasmallTM1- TM1'(or TM2-TM2') crossing angle of $- 4 1 ^ { \circ }$ (or $- 2 8 ^ { \circ } )$ .Despite overall similarities,differencesbetweenthe closed-stateMaMscL and MtMscL structures are also present.The pore-constricting residuein MaMscLisPhe23,whereas the MtMscL channelisconstricted at Val21 (Fig. S2C).The tilt angle of TM2 and the TM2- TM2'crossing angle of MaMscL are both $8 ^ { \circ }$ smaller than those of MtMscL，whereas the TM1 tilt angles and TM1-TM1'crossing anglesare identical between the two structures.Moreover,MaMscL naturallylacks the small cytoplasmic domain that formsa coiled-coil helical bundle structure in MtMscL (27) or EcMscL (33).

When the MaMscL switches from the closed state to the expanded state,massive structural rearrangements occur in the transmembrane region, the N-terminal helix(N-helix),and the periplasmic loop region (Fig.2A).Meanwhile,the width of its periplasmic surface increases from $5 0 \textrm { \AA }$ to $6 \dot { 6 } \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ ,leadingto a dramatic expansion of the surface area $( \Delta \mathrm { A } )$ by $\mathrm { \sim } 1 , 4 5 7 \mathrm { \AA } ^ { \mathrm { \scriptsize { 8 } } ^ { \mathrm { \scriptsize { 7 } } } }$ .This △Avalue is close to the in-plane protein area change of the first expanded substate (but smaller than that of the open state) derived from the energy-area profiles of $E$ coli MscL (34). The hydrophobic constriction site of MaMscL(located around Phe-23） increases its width from $2 . 4 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ (closed） to $7 . 5 { - } 9 . 0 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ (expanded) (Figs. S3A and $\mathsf { S 4 } A$ and $B$ ).Accompanying the expansion within the membrane plane,the thickness of the channel decreases from $4 4 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ to $3 0 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ Compared with the closed-state structures,the expanded-state MaMscL structure hasmore tilted TM1 and TM2 helices (with $5 8 ^ { \circ }$ and $4 2 ^ { \circ }$ tilt angles,respectively) and larger TM1-TM1'(or TM2-TM2'） crossing angles at $- 6 \dot { 0 } ^ { \circ }$ (or $- 4 6 ^ { \circ }$ (TableS1).

Rearrangement of the Transmembrane Helices.The thinning of the transmembrane domain of MaMscL is a consequence of largedegree pivoting of the TM1-TM2'helix pair toward the membrane plane when the channel changes conformation from the closed state to the expanded state (Fig.2A).The intersubunit TM1-TM2'helix pair moves as a rigid body during the transition (Fig. S3B),consistent with the previous observation based on the comparison of MtMscL and SaMscL-C△26 structures (28).Accompanying the pivoting movement of TM1-TM2'in MaMscL, its TM2 rotates by $3 1 ^ { \circ }$ relative to the TM1 within the same subunit (Fig. S3C). Meanwhile, $\mathbf { T M } \mathbf { 1 } ^ { \prime }$ slides along the surface of the TM1-TM2'helix pair and the ${ \bf A } 2 2 ^ { \prime } – { \bf A } 2 0$ contact point between TM1'and TM1 shiftsto the ${ \bf S } 2 9 ^ { \prime } – { \bf A } 2 0$ site.The contact between TM1'and $\mathbf { T M } 2 ^ { \prime }$ alters from $\mathbf { V } 3 7 ^ { \prime } – \mathbf { N } 7 7 ^ { \prime }$ to $\mathrm { V } 3 7 ^ { \prime } { - } \mathrm { I } 8 0 ^ { \prime }$ (Fig. $2 B$ and $C$ ).When the TM1-TM2'-TM1'triplets from the two MaMscL structures are superposed,it is evident that $\mathbf { T M } \mathbf { 1 } ^ { \prime }$ undergoes a slight clockwise rotation around Gly26 by $1 8 ^ { \circ }$ with respect to the TM1-TM2'pair(Fig. $2 D$ ）

According to Spencer and Rees (35),the helix-pivoting movement in a symmetrical homo-oligomeric channel follows the geometric relationship described by the following two equations, namely $\mathrm { c o s } \alpha = \mathrm { c o s } ^ { 2 } \eta + \mathrm { s i n } ^ { 2 } \eta \mathrm { c o s } \theta$ and $R = d ( \tan \eta \cot ( \alpha / 2 ) - 1 ) / 2$ In these equations, $\alpha$ is the interhelical-crossing angles, $\eta$ is the tilt angle of the TM1 helix with respect to the pore axis, $\theta = 7 2 ^ { \circ }$ for a pentameric channel, $R$ is the minimum pore radius,and $d$ is the diameter of a transmembrane helix.To verify this theory,we have generated a series of calculated models of MaMscL according to the above equations. The input model is a single pair of TM1- $\mathbf { T M } 2 ^ { \prime }$ helices extracted from the closed-state structure ofMaMscL and realigned with their helical axes parallel to the pore axis.When the helix tilt angle $\eta$ reaches $3 7 ^ { \circ }$ and $5 8 ^ { \circ }$ ,the calculated structures matchwell with the experimental closed-state and expanded-state structures of MaMscL structures (Fig. $S 3 D$ and $E$ ).Thus,these two conformational states of MaMscL fit reasonably well in the rearrangement trajectorypredicted bythe Spencer-Rees equation. The transition of MaMscL from the closed state to the expanded state occurs through a coordinated helix-pivoting rearrangement in the transmembrane domain (Movie S1). It is also noteworthy that there might be slight $( 1 8 ^ { \circ } - 3 3 ^ { \circ } )$ corkscrew-type rotation of TM1 accompanying the helix-pivoting movement (Fig. S4C). Such rotation was predicted to occur in larger degrees for the open state of EcMscL (24,25,32, 36).

Conformational Changes in the Periplasmic Loop Region. The periplasmic loop of MscL influences its gating kinetics and mechanosensitivity (37-39)，but the structural basis underlying its regulatory function is not well understood.On the periplasmic side of MaMscL,the loop between TM1 and TM2 contains a folded region with an“@"-shaped structure (o-loop） between residues Pro50-Ala57 (PGGGWETA) and a short $\beta$ -hairpin structure following the ${ \bf \omega } _ { \omega }$ -loop (Fig. $3 A$ and $B$ ).ForMtMscL,a careful reinspection of its electron density map has led to an improved structural model for its periplasmic loop region (Fig. 3 $C$ and $D$ ).The result shows that similar ${ \bf \omega } _ { \omega }$ -loop (residues Gly47- Ile56, GVNAQSDVGI) and $\beta$ -hairpin structures also exist in the corresponding region of MtMscL.

The structurally conserved $\boldsymbol { \omega }$ -loop and $\beta$ -hairpin motifs serve to fold the long polypeptide chain of the loop at the resting closed state.Theyalso provide the flexibility for the loop to stretch out like a spring when the channel opens in response to mechanical force.The $\boldsymbol { \omega }$ -loop ofMaMscL in theclosed state inserts into the pore lumen,with Trp54 forming van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of TM1.Meanwhile,the $\beta$ -hairpin is associated with the C-terminal end of TM1 and the ω-loop froman adjacent subunit. The loop-TM1/TM1'interactions and the hydrogen bonds formed within the @-loop and the $\beta$ -hairpin motifs collectively contribute to the stabilization of the channel at the resting closed state. Deletion of six residues (Gly51-Thr56) from the ${ \bf \omega } _ { \infty }$ -loopregion abolishes the channel's function during osmotic downshock (Fig. $3 E$ ).On the other hand,when this segment (Gly51- Thr56) of the @-loop is replaced by poly-Ala of the same length, the survivability of cells hosting this construct after osmotic downshock increases to a level close to those expressing $E$ coli MscL (the positive control, Fig. $3 E$ ). Compared with the wildtypeMaMscL,the hairpin_6Amutant exhibitsaslightlylarger conductance $( 0 . 4 3 \mathrm { - } 0 . 4 6 ~ \mathrm { n S }$ vs. 0.2-0.3 nS) (Fig. $\operatorname { s } 1 H$ and $I$ )and gates at a lower pressure threshold $\mathrm { ( p L / p S }$ ratio $\sim 0 . 9$ vs. 1.6). Thus, the ${ \bf \omega } _ { \omega }$ -loop motif is involved in regulating the sensitivity of MscL to osmotic downshock.

(A) The ω-loop and $\beta$ -hairpin structures in the periplasmic loops of MaMscL (blue) and MtMscL (red,with a rebuilt loop structure).The original structure of the MtMscL loop before being rebuilt (PDB ID code 2OAR) is shown in silver.(B)The local structure of the o-loop of MaMscL with the hydrogen bonds indicated by the dashed lines.The unit for the numbers labeled around the dashed lines is angstroms.The $2 F _ { \circ } { - } F _ { \mathrm { c } }$ map (gray meshes)is contoured at $1 . 0 \times \sigma$ . (C and D) Representations of the $C _ { \alpha }$ traces of the original MtMscL structure (C)and the rebuilt MtMscL structure $( D )$ superposed on the $2 F _ { \circ } – F _ { \mathrm { c } }$ electron density map (contoured at $1 . 8 \times \sigma )$ .(E)The phenotypes of MaMscL mutants with altered ω-loop sequences are demonstrated through the osmotic downshock experiments.The "hairpin_del"and "hairpin_6A" represent the MaMscL constructs with the ω-loop region (PGGGWETA) deleted or replaced by six alanine residues (GGGWET/6A). EcMscL,MaMscL,and empty vector (pET15b) are included as controls.

Previously, the Q56P and K55T mutants (with mutations in the ω-loop region) of EcMscL were shown to gate at pressure thresholds lower than that of the wild-type channel (37,4O). These mutations may disrupt the hydrogen bonds within the $\boldsymbol { \omega }$ -loop oraffect the loop-TM1 interactions.The Q65R and Q65L mutations on the $\beta$ -hairpin region ofEcMscL lead to partial gain-of-function and loss-of-function phenotypes, respectively (39). Proteolytic cleavage on the periplasmic loop region increases the channel's sensitivity to membrane tension (38),furtherunderscoring the pivotal role of this region in modulating the mechanosensitivity of MscL.Curiously, the sequence and length of the periplasmic loop appear to be variable among different species (Fig. S5D). These considerations suggest that this region may be the result of divergent evolution entitling MscL channels from different species with the flexibility to adjust their mechanosensitivity to adapt to different living environments.

In the expanded state, the periplasmic loop from one of the five subunits of the MaMscL channel exhibits continuous electron density with an extended conformation,whereas those in the other four subunits are mostly disordered.This observation indicates the loops are fairly flexible in the expanded state (Fig. ${ \bf S } 5 { \bf \Omega } A$ and $B$ ).The loop extension also occurs in the expanded intermediate-state structure of SaMscL (Fig. S5C). Therefore, the transition from the closed state to the expanded state not onlyinvolves pivoting movement of the transmembrane helices, but also is accompanied by stretching of the periplasmic loop when the distance between the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM2 helices increases.

Mechanical Coupling Between the N-helix and TMs.The N-helix is essential for the function of MscL as indicated by the previous studies showing that EcMscL with the N-terminal region deleted (△2-12) is nonfunctional (37, 41). Initially, it was proposed that this region forms a small helical bundle serving as a second gate underneath the pore (22,23).Later,guided by an improved structural model of MtMscL (42),the functional characterizations of this region through cysteine scanning mutagenesis suggested that its function is likely a membrane anchor instead of a second gate (43).As shown in Fig. $4 A$ and $B$ ,repositioning of the N-helix with respect to the TM1 helix (and to the membrane plane） is observed when the two MaMscL structures are compared.In the closed state,the N-helix assumes a tilted position, forming a $3 4 ^ { \circ }$ angle with the membrane plane (or $5 6 ^ { \circ }$ with the membrane normal).It becomes nearly horizontal to the membrane surface in the expanded state.During the transition, the N-helix pivots toward the membrane plane in a direction opposite to that of TM1 (Fig.4B).The pivot point is located at the joint (residue Lys15) between the N-helix and TM1.The crossing angle between the N-helix and TM1 increases from $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ to $1 3 7 ^ { \circ }$ during the transition from the closed state to the expanded state. Meanwhile, the angle between the N-helix and the membrane plane decreases from $3 4 ^ { \circ }$ to $8 ^ { \circ }$ ：

How is the movement of the N-helix coupled to those of the TM1 and TM2 helices during the gating transition? As shown in Fig. 4 $C { - } E$ and Movie S1, when the TM1(A)-TM2(E) helix pair tilts toward the membrane plane,TM1(A) pushes on the TM1 (B)-TM2(A) pair and TM1(B) pushes on the next pair TM1(C)- TM2(B) and so on,as in a domino effect (Fig. $4 E$ ).Furthermore, the $\mathrm { T M 1 } ( \mathrm { A } ) { \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { T M } 2 ( \mathrm { E } )$ pair directly contacts the N-helix(B) (Fig. $4 ~ C$ and $D$ ),primarily through van der Waals interactions between them.The bulky side chains of the Phe4 and Phe7residues from the N-helix(B) form van der Waals interactionswith TM2 of subunitE,whereas Phe1O intercalates into the space between the TM1(A)-TM2(E) pair and interacts with both of them (Fig.

Consequently, the C-terminal end of TM2(E) approaches the N-terminal Leu3 and $\mathrm { \ G l u 9 4 }$ on the N-helix(B) at the expanded state,and their interactions can be validated by the disulfide-trapping experiments (44) under osmotic shock conditions (Fig. S6 E-G).Thereby,the movement of the N-helix is coupled to the tilting motions of the two transmembrane helices.Such a mechanism is reminiscent of the opening of an umbrella whereas the TM2 behaves like an umbrella stretcher and the N-helix resembles the rib that is pushed to open by the stretcher (Movie S1).

At the other end of the gating transition,we ask whether the tilting of transmembrane helices will ever reach a limit during channel opening;i.e.，What limits the tilt of the TM helices during the gating process?We have addressed these questions by modeling the geometric relationship between the N-helix and TM1 (Fig. 4B) and found that the tilt angle of the N-helix $\left( \psi \right)$ is related to the tilt angle of TM1 $( \eta )$ through the following equation: $r ( \mathrm { c o s } \eta _ { 1 } - \mathrm { c o s } \eta _ { 2 } ) = \Delta h = n ( \mathrm { c o s } \psi _ { 1 } - \mathrm { c o s } \psi _ { 2 } )$ ,where $r$ and $n$ are the lengths between the joint point and the pivot/anchor points on the TM1 and N-helix, respectively. $\Delta h$ is the vertical translation of the joint point during the conformational change. In the closed state, $\eta _ { 1 } = 3 7 ^ { \circ }$ and $\psi _ { 1 } = - 5 6 ^ { \circ }$ ,whereas the expandedstate structure has $\eta _ { 2 } = 5 8 ^ { \circ }$ and $\psi _ { 2 } = - 8 2 ^ { \circ }$ . Thereby, $r / n = [ \cos$ $( - 5 6 ^ { \circ } ) - \cos ( - 8 2 ^ { \circ } ) ] / ( \cos 3 7 ^ { \circ } - \cos 5 8 ^ { \circ } ) = 1 . 5 6$ The $r / n$ parameter should be constant during the transition when the pivot point of TM1 is stable and the anchor point on the N-helix remains within the membrane plane under different conformational states. This is indeed verified by observations based on the closed- and expanded-state MaMscL structures (Fig. 4A). The pivot point of TM1 is located near Gly26,which contacts residues Phe23 and Ile24 from the adjacent TM1 (Fig. S6H), such that its position in the two conformational statesremains nearly constant (relative to the adjacent TM1,Fig. $2 D$ ).Mutation of Gly26 to histidine leads to a severe gain-of-function phenotype (Fig. S6l),presumably by weakening the TM1-TM1'association and affecting the stability of the nearby pore constriction.The $\mathrm { C } _ { \alpha } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { C } _ { \alpha }$ distance between Gly26 andLys15 (joint point) is $1 8 . 1 \mathring \mathrm { A }$ ,yieldingameasured value for the $r$ parameter.To search for the membrane-anchoring point, the distances between the $C _ { \alpha }$ atoms of Lys15 and the residues on the N-helix were measured. Of these,Phe7 is located $1 1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ fromLys-15 andthe distancematcheswell with the calculated $n$ parameter of $1 1 . 6 \mathrm { \AA }$ ,when $r = 1 8 . 1 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ and $r / n = 1 . 5 6$ . This result consequently indicates that Phe7 on the N-helix most likely serves as the membrane-anchoring point during the gating transition.It is highly conserved among different MscL homologs (Fig. S5D) (43). Such an anchor point is not completely fixed but can slide horizontally along the membrane plane during the gating transition (Fig. 4B). In this scenario, $\psi$ is related to $\eta$ through the following equation:

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \psi = F ( \eta ) = \cos ^ { - 1 } [ \cos ( - 5 6 ^ { \circ } ) - 1 . 5 6 \cos ( 3 7 ^ { \circ } ) + 1 . 5 6 \cos \eta ] } } \\ { { \nonumber } } \\ { { = \cos ^ { - 1 } ( 1 . 5 6 \cos \eta - 0 . 6 9 ) . } } \end{array}
$$

In the fully expanded state, the N-helix can achieve a maximal tilt angle $\ l ( \psi )$ at $\bar { - } 9 0 ^ { \circ }$ only when it is coplanar with the membrane surface.Beyond this point,the amphipathicN-helixwould protrude out of the membrane,leading to an energetically unfavorable status due to exposure of hydrophobic residues to the aqueous environment.When confined at the horizontal position by the membrane surface, the N-helix serves_as a door stop, preventing TM1-TM2' from tilting further.In this case,the mutual relationship betweentheN-helixand TM1 predictsthe limit for the tilt angle of TM1 $( \eta )$ at a maximum value of ${ \sim } 6 4 ^ { \circ }$ when $\psi = - 9 0 ^ { \circ }$ .In the expanded MaMscL structure,the $\eta$ angle of TM1 is at $5 8 ^ { \circ }$ ,indicating this state is approaching the limit for helix-tilting movement. The full opening of the pore might consequently require a second step corresponding to the outward swinging of the TM1-TM2'helix pair away from the pore axis in aniris-like opening motion (28),instead of by further tilting of the TM1-TM2 pair toward the membrane plane.

In summary,MscL gates like a nanoscale mechanical valve that exhibits highly coupled and well-coordinated movements of each individual part as shown in Movie S1 and Fig. $4 E$ . The two new structures of MaMscL now provide direct evidence delineating the mechanism of physical coupling among its multiple structural elements during channel expansion.
