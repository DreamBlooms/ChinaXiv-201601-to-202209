A serials of imidazolium functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone)as anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for all-vanadium redox flow battery(VRB)application are synthesized successfullyin this study.The AEMs obtainedwith different ionization levels,Im-PAES-0.5/0.7/1.1(0.5/0.7/1.1represents thedifferentdegrees of bromination，respectively）membranes are intensively characterized.Compared with commercial Nafion 117 membrane,the vanadium ion permeation values of AEMs are lower while their chemical stability in $\mathsf { V O } ^ { 2 + }$ are comparable. The ionic conductivities,vanadium ion permeability，stability of the membranes and their performance in VRB cels are greatly affected by ionic exchange capacity (IEC).In order to balance these important performance factors,the Im-PAES-0.7 membrane with a moderate IEC of 2.01 meq ${ \mathfrak { g } } ^ { - 1 }$ exhibits good stability， high ionic conductivity and low vanadium ion permeation, resulting in high voltage efficiencies (up to $8 7 . 5 \%$ ，high coulombic efficiencies (up to $9 6 . 1 \%$ ,as well as high energy effciency.The VRB cellwith the Im-PAES-0.7 membrane achieves comparable to or even slightly higher energy efficiency values (up to $8 1 . 7 \%$ ）than those of Nafion 117 membranes (up to $78 . 9 \%$ in the current density range of $6 0 { - } 1 2 0 ~ \mathsf { m A } ~ \mathsf { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ .During 40 charge-discharge cycles at different current densities,the Im-PAES-0.7anion exchange membrane exhibits a comparable short-term stability to Nafion 117 membrane.

# 1.Introduction

All-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) have received more and more attention during the past decades for their deepdischargecapability，flexible design，longcycle life，fast response time and low cost.1-3 They are being considered as a promising energy storage system for electric vehicles and large-scale grid connected equipment.4- As a core component of the VRB system,the ion exchange membrane (IEM) not only separatestwosideofelectrolytestopreventcrosscontamination，but also provides ionic conduction channels to balance the charge of electrolytes and complete the circuit during the charge-discharge cycle process.7,8

An ideal IEM for the VRB application should have high ionic conductivity,low permeability of vanadiumions,good chemical stability,mechanical property and low cost.9,1o Currently,Nafion membranes are used as common IEMs for commercial VRB cells since their high ionic conductivities,excellent chemical and mechanical properties.However,till now,their applica tions are still limited by intrinsic high permeability of vanadium ions and high cost.

To seek improved alternative IEMs for the VRB,efforts have been devoted to modifying Nafion membranes11-13 and developing membranes with novel chemical structures.14-2o Anion exchange membranes (AEMs),having higher barrier property forthe positively charged vanadium ions from the Donnan exclusion effect，have been reported with improved performance in VRB.21-29 However, conventional ammonium based cationic structures on the AEMs tend to have low chemical stability in the VRB environment.

Owing to the existence of the conjugated $\pi$ bond in the unique N-heterocyclic structure,imidazolium based structures exhibit not only high ionic conductivity,but also high oxidation resistance,good chemical and thermal stability.In the past several years，imidazolium-containing polymers have been greatly developed and used as anion exchange membranes for alkaline fuel cells (AFCs).30-38 However, the imidazolium contained AEMs for VRB cells application are rarely reported. Recently,Fang and co-workers synthesized a novel type of anion exchange membrane based on poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate-co-N-vinyl imidazole） for the VRB application.It was foundthatthistypeof AEM exhibited significantlylowpermeability of vanadium ions and good chemical stability in electrolytes.39

To further explore more kinds of imidazolium-containing AEMs and investigate the relationship of“structure-property" of AEMs for applications in VRB.Herein，we reported on a serials of imidazolium functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone） AEMs for the application of VRB cells.The readily available raw materials,including methylhydroquinone (M-HQ) and/or2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone(TM-HQ) with $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { \cdot } }$ dichlorophenylsulfone (DCPS),are employed to construct the polymer backbone.The properties of the obtained membranes, including ionic conductivity,ion exchange capacity (IEC),water uptake,chemical stability,vanadium permeability as well as cell charge-dischargecyclingperformance were carefully investigated.

# 2.2Preparation of anion exchange membrane

Thepreparation processes of imidazolium functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) polymers were illustrated in Schemes1 and 2,respectively.

2.2.1Synthesis of M-PAES.M-PAES (shown in Scheme 1) was synthesized via a general polycondensation reaction.

2.2.2Bromination.The preparation procedure of BM-PAES was set asa typical example forbromination reaction:M-PAES (5 g)and1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TTCE, $\mathrm { 1 0 0 ~ m l }$ wereadded to a $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser,a magnetic stirrer.When the M-PAES polymer was completely dissolved, $N$ bromosuccinimide (NBS, $2 . 3 \textrm { ~ g }$ $1 3 \mathrm { \ m m o l } \mathrm { \Omega } _ { \cdot }$ ）and benzoyl peroxide (BPO, $0 . 1 6 \ \mathrm { g } , \ 0 . 6 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l } )$ were added subsequently into the reaction mixture.The solution was heated at $8 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ undernitrogen atmosphere.Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature,and poured into $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of ethanol. The formed fibrous polymer was washed by ethanol with several times continuously and dried under vacuum at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to obtain the desired BM-PAES polymer,which BM denotes the brominated product.

2.2.3Preparation of Im-PAES membranes. The typical procedure for the preparation of Im-PAES membrane:BM-PAES (1 g) was dissolved in $N \cdot$ methy-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a $1 0 \mathrm { \ : w t \% }$ solution,and followed addition of $N \cdot$ methylimidazole $\left( 4 9 2 \mathrm { m g } , 6 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ at $5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ After $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ ,the reaction mixture was casted onto a clean and smooth glass plate,and the glass plate was completely dried under atmosphere at ${ 7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .In order to remove the residual $N _ { \mathbf { \lambda } }$ -methylimidazole within the membrane,the as-prepared membrane was immersed into a $5 \mathrm { w t \% }$ HCl aqueous for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,asaresult, thedesired chloride $( \mathbf { C l } ^ { - } )$ form Im-PAES membrane was obtained after washing with deionized water.

2.3.1 ${ \bf \sigma } ^ { \mathbf { 1 } } { \bf { \mathit { H } } }$ NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Using $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { \ M H z } }$ spectrometer (Bruker) to record $\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ NMR spectra.Deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO- ${ \bf d } _ { 6 }$ )wasused as the solvent.FT-IR spectra of the samples were analyzed in the range of 3500- $9 5 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ by using a Thermo-Niclolet 6700 spectrometer.

2.3.2 GPC measurement. The molecular weight $\left( M _ { \mathrm { n } } \right)$ and molecular weight distribution $\left( M _ { \mathrm { w } } / M _ { \mathrm { n } } \right)$ of the polymers were measured by using a gel permeation chromatography (PL-GPC 220) equipped with Agilent 1260 Infinity pump,a refractive index (RI) detector.Chloroform $\begin{array} { r l } {  { \bigl ( \mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 } \bigr ) } } \end{array}$ wasused as the eluent with a flow rate of $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { m l \ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ at $4 0 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \bf C } .$ 、Molecular weight was calibrated with standard polystyrene samples.

2.3.3Water uptake (WU).The water uptake of the Im-PAES membrane (in chloride form) was measured by immersing the membrane sample in deionized water at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .Then, the membrane was taken out,the excess water on the surface was wiped out by using absorbent paper and weighed immediately.Afterwards,the membrane wasdried under vacuum at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for at least $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,and the membrane was weighed again until the weight was invariable.The water uptake was calculated according to the following equation:

$$
\mathbf { W U } ( \% ) = \frac { \left( W _ { \mathrm { w e t } } - W _ { \mathrm { d r y } } \right) } { W _ { \mathrm { d r y } } } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

where $W _ { \mathrm { w e t } }$ and $W _ { \mathrm { d r y } }$ are the mass of the membrane in the wet and dry states,respectively.

membrane.Firstly,the membrane sample was dried under vacuum at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,and the lengths of membrane was measured.Afterwards,the membrane was soaked in deionized water for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ and the length of the membrane was measured again. The swelling ratio was calculated using the following equation:

$$
\mathrm { S R } \left( \% \right) = \frac { L _ { 1 } - L _ { 0 } } { L _ { 0 } } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

where $L _ { 1 }$ and $L _ { 0 }$ are the lengths of the wet membrane and dry membrane,respectively.

2.3.5Ion exchange capacity (IEC). The ion exchange capacity (IEC) was determined by titration method.The ImPAES membrane was accurately weighed and immersed in $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ N a N O } _ { 3 }$ solution for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at room temperature to undergo complete ionic exchange process.Afterwards, the solution was titrated with $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ A g N O } _ { 3 }$ standard solution and $\mathbf { K } _ { 2 } \mathbf { C r O } _ { 4 }$ $( 5 ~ \mathrm { w t \% } )$ was used as the indicator. IEC $\mathrm { ( m e q ~ g ^ { - 1 } ) }$ was calculated using the following equation:

$$
\mathrm { I E C } = \frac { V _ { \mathrm { A g N O _ { 3 } } } \times C _ { \mathrm { A g N O _ { 3 } } } } { M _ { \mathrm { d r y } } }
$$

where $V _ { \mathrm { A g N O _ { 3 } } }$ is the volume of consumed ${ \bf A g N O } _ { 3 }$ standard solution, $C _ { \mathrm { A g N O _ { 3 } } }$ is the concentration of ${ \bf A g N O } _ { 3 }$ standard solution,and $M _ { \mathrm { d r y } }$ is the weight of dry membrane,respectively.

2.3.6Ionic conductivity. The ionic conductivity of the membrane sample was determined via AC impedance spectroscopy with a Zehner electrochemical equipment (Germany) in the frequency ranging from $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { H z }$ to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k H z }$ .The area resistance $( R )$ of Im-PAES anion exchange membrane was measured at Zehner electrochemistry working station by the two-probe method in deionized water. The ionic conductivity $\sigma$ $( \mathrm { { s \ c m } ^ { - 1 } } )$ of the membrane sample was calculated using the following formula:

$$
\sigma = \frac { l } { R A }
$$

where $l$ is the distance between the two electrodes $( { \mathrm { c m } } ) , A$ is the area of cross section $( \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } )$ 5 $R$ is the membrane resistance $\mathbf { \Omega } ( \Omega )$

2.3.7Permeability of $\mathbf { V } \mathbf { O } ^ { 2 + }$ . The permeability of $\mathrm { V O } ^ { 2 + }$ ions across the membrane was measured via the following method. The membrane was pressed between two half-cells with graphite felts on both sides to prevent the leakage of electrolyte. One side was filled with the solution of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ V O S O _ { 4 } }$ in $_ 3 \textbf { M }$ $\mathrm { \bf H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { \bf S O } _ { 4 }$ ,and the other side was filled with the solution of $1 . 5 \mathrm { { M } }$ $\bf { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ in $3 \mathrm { ~ M ~ H _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } }$ .Herein, $\bf { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ wasused to equalize the ionic strength of the two sides and minimize the osmotic pressure effects.The volume for each side was same $4 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ and the membrane area exposed in the solution was ${ 9 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ .1 ml of $\bf { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ solution sample was taken out at intervals to test the $\mathrm { V O } ^ { 2 + }$ ions permeability by using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Thepermeability of vanadium ions throughthe membranes can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
V \frac { \mathrm { d } C _ { t } } { \mathrm { d } t } { = } S \frac { P } { L } ( C _ { 0 } - C _ { t } )
$$

where $V$ is the volume of the solution in both sides, $s$ is the area of the membrane exposed in the solution, $P$ is the permeability parameter of vanadium ions, $L$ is the thickness of the membrane samples, $C _ { 0 }$ is the initial concentration of the vanadium ions and $C _ { t }$ is the vanadium ions concentration in $\bf { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ solution at time $t$ ,respectively.

2.3.8Chemical stability.Thechemical stabilityof Im-PAES membranes was evaluated and measured through the weight loss of membrane in $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ V O } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ solution within 10 days.The dry membrane was firstly immersed into deionized water for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ ,and then the wet membrane sample was weighted after the water on the surface of membrane was completely wiped out. Immersing the membrane sample into the solution of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ ${ \mathrm { V O } _ { 2 } } ^ { + }$ (V) in 3 M $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ ，and then the accurate weight of the membrane sample was obtained every day.

# 2.4Cell cycling performance

The cell charge-discharge cycling test was carried out according to the method depicted in the literature.26 Initially，the membrane $( 6 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } )$ was sandwiched between two pieces of carbon felts,and the thickness and area of carbon felts were $5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ and $6 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ ，respectively. Two pieces of graphite plates were employed as current collectors (thickness: $4 \ \mathrm { m m } \dot { }$ ).The negative electrolyte was the solution of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ V } ^ { 3 + }$ in 3 M $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ and the positive electrolyte was the solution of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ V ~ } ^ { 4 ^ { + } }$ in $3 \textbf { M }$ $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ .Injecting $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of the negative and the positive electrolytesin two tanks,respectively.The flowing rate of the electrolytes was $3 0 \mathrm { \ m l \ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ . The charge-discharge cycling was performed at current density of 60,80, $1 2 0 \mathrm { \ m A \ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，respectively. The upper limit voltage was charged to $1 . 7 ~ \mathrm { V }$ and the lower voltage limit was $0 . 8 \mathrm { V }$ The cell efficiencies of the cell were calculated using the following equations:

$$
\mathrm { C E } = { \frac { C _ { \mathrm { d } } } { C _ { \mathrm { c } } } } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

$$
{ \mathrm { E E } } = { \frac { E _ { \mathrm { d } } } { E _ { \mathrm { c } } } } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

$$
{ \mathrm { V E } } = { \frac { \mathrm { E E } } { \mathrm { C E } } } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

where $C _ { \mathrm { d } }$ is the discharge capacity and $C _ { \mathrm { c } }$ is the charge capacity of the cell, $E _ { \mathrm { d } }$ is the discharge energy and $E _ { \mathrm { c } }$ is the charge energy of the cell, respectively.

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1GPC, ${ \bf ^ 1 { \bf H } }$ NMR and FT-IR spectra

The molecular weight and polydispersity index $\left( M _ { \mathrm { w } } / M _ { \mathrm { n } } \right)$ of M-PAES and TM-PAES were analyzed with GPC using chloroform eluent,and the results were summarized in Table 1.Both M-PAES and TM-PAES resins exhibited suficient high molecular weight $\left( M _ { \mathrm { n } } > 4 7 \mathrm { ~ K ~ } _ { \right. }$ ，as confirmed by GPC） for further membraneformation.

α Determined by GPC.

From Fig.1,it can be seen that the single peak at $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { p p m }$ was assigned to the protons of methyl group $\left( H _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ . The signal of protons sited at ortho-position of phenylsulfonyl was observed at $8 . 0 \ \mathrm { \ p p m } \ \left( H _ { \mathrm { f } } \right)$ ，By comparison of the integral ratio of the protons of $H _ { \mathbf { a } }$ and $H _ { \mathrm { f } } ,$ the structure ofM-PAES polymer can be confirmed. After the bromination reaction of the benzyl group, an obvious signal showed at $4 . 5 \ : \mathrm { p p m }$ which was ascribed to the protons of bromomethyl group $\left( H _ { \mathrm { b } } \right)$ .Afterwards,the signal of $H _ { \mathrm { b } }$ was disappeared and a single peak at 5.3 ppm was observed $\left( H _ { \mathrm { e } } \right)$ ，indicating that the bromo atom was completely substituted by the $N _ { \mathbf { \lambda } }$ -methyl-imidazolering.Furthermore,the broad peak at $9 . 2 \ \mathrm { p p m }$ was attributed to the proton of imidazolium $\left( H _ { \mathrm { d } } \right)$ ,as well as the single peak at 3.7 ppm was the typical signal of methyl group attached on the imidazolium structure $\left( H _ { \mathrm { c } } \right)$ .All these results totally confirmed the successful intro duction of the imidazolium ring.The degree of functionalization (DF) of Im-PAES polymers was defined as the average number of imidazolium groups on per repeating unit,and could be calculated via comparing the ratio of integration value of the above mentioned typical protons.

The FT-IR spectra of BM-PAES and Im-PAES samples were shown in Fig.2.The peak at $3 0 2 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was ascribed to the vibration of aromatic $\mathbf { C } { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { H }$ bond. The weak signal at $2 9 1 5 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was assigned to the vibration of the aliphatic $\mathbf { C } { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { H }$ bond on the methyl or methylene groups.The strong signals of the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { C }$ bond on phenyl rings were observed at 1527 and $1 4 2 9 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively. The peak at $1 3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was mainly attributed to the vibration of $\mathbf { C - N }$ bond on the imidazolium group.4o Both $\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ NMR and FT-IR results offered a sufficient evidence to validate the successful synthesis ofIm-PAES serials membranes.

# 3.2Water uptake (WU), swelling ratio (sR) and ion exchange capacity (IEC)

The water uptake, swelling ratio as well as ion exchange capacity of the prepared anion exchange membranes were summarized in Table 2.It can be seen that the water uptake and swelling ratio of the membranes increased significantly with increasing the content of ion exchange groups,which was mainly attributed to more ion exchange groups can cause higher hydrophilicity and water content of the membrane.As well known, the transport channels foranions could be formed from waterclusters inside the membrane.Therefore,the ionic conductivity was closely correlated with the content of ion exchange groups,the higher density of salt groups will promote more efficient movement of anions inside the membrane and higher ionic conductivity would be obtained.Additionally,it was also observed that the measured IEC value was in good accordance with the value calculated from $\mathrm { ^ 1 H }$ NMR,this result further confirmed that the complete introduction of $N \mathrm { . }$ -methyl-imidazolium.

# 3.3Ionic conductivity

Ionic conductivity is a very important parameter to evaluate the membranes for applications in VRB.As shown in Fig.3,the ionic conductivities of the Im-PAES-0.5 membrane increased from 6.58 to $3 6 . 7 6 ~ \mathrm { m S ~ c m } ^ { - 1 }$ , while temperature was changing from 30 to $9 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ，For the Im-PAES-0.7 membrane,a maximum ionic conductivity could be achieved as $7 3 . 1 \mathrm { m S } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ when the temperature increased to $9 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ Both of the ionic conductivities of Im-PAES membranes kept an significant rising trend as the temperature increasing.This was mainly because of the mobility of anions and the free volume inside the membrane increased with the temperature increasing，which could be beneficial to ionic transmission.41 Moreover,it was observed that the Im-PAES-1.1 membrane was degraded and dispersed to several pieces when the temperature increased above $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } ,$ which was caused by its over-high IEC value.In general,the high ionic conductivity of membrane was gained at the expense of the other aspects of performance,especially mechanical strength and swelling degree.

To evaluate the solvent resistance of different kinds of polymers,some polar proton/non-proton solvents were screened and the results were shown in Table 3.It can be seen that except alcohol,acetone and acetonitrile,the brominated resins,BMPAES exhibited moderate to good solubility in the most of solvents such as $N \cdot$ methyl pyrrolidone (NMP),dimethylacetamide (DMAc),dimethylsulfoxide (DMsO) as well as chloroform $\mathrm { ( C H C l _ { 3 } ) }$ 1.Moreover,an obvious comparison can be observed that the solubility of the Im-PAES membranes were poorer than that ofBM-PAES，and the solubility decreased with the IEC increasing.This result provided us a design guidance for the AEMs structure with good solvent and acid resistance.

# 3.5Permeability of vanadium ions

The permeability of vanadium ions across membrane was a significant factor which can influence the VRB performance, this was mainly because the crossover of vanadium ions through the membrane would cause serious self-discharge of VRB cell system and lead to low coulombic efficiency. According to the eqn (5),the permeability $( P )$ of $\mathrm { { V } ( \mathrm { { r v } ) } }$ ions was calculated and shown as Fig.4.Compared with Im-PAES-1.1 and Nafion 117 membranes,the Im-PAES- $0 . 5 / 0 . 7$ membranes showed quite low vanadium permeabilityafter one day,onlyabout $0 . 0 5 \ \times$ $1 0 ^ { - 7 } \mathrm { \ c m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ and $0 . 0 7 \ \times \ 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \ \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ ，respectively. Moreover, there was no obvious changes after10 days for both membranes.These results could be explained by the coulomb repulsion between the cation groups existed inside the membrane and vanadium ions.However，the Im-PAES-1.1 membrane showed much higher vanadium permeability than that of the Im-PAES $0 . 5 / 0 . 7$ membranes.We speculated that this abnormal result was mostly attributed to the high water uptake of the Im-PAES-1.1 membrane,which led to the absorption of much vanadium ions from the concentrated side and transmitting to the other blank solution.

# 3.6Membrane stability

The chemical stability of the membrane directly influences the VRB cell lifespan.In this work，the stability of Im-PAES membranes in the solution which contained oxidative V(v) ions was also studied. The samples were measured by soaking in a solution of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ V O } _ { 2 } ^ { + }$ in 3M $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for 10 days, and the weight changes of membranes were calculated every day.As shown in Fig.5,both Im-PAES-0.5 and Im-PAES-0.7 membranes showed slight weight loss of about $3 \%$ and $2 \%$ during the whole measuring process， respectively. This evidence indicated that the Im-PAES-0.5/0.7 membranes possess at least moderate durability in the strong oxidative ${ \mathrm { V O } _ { 2 } } ^ { + }$ electrolyte.As a result,we believed that the compact structure of two membranes was a beneficial factor to elevate theirchemical stability.In contrast, the Im-PAES-1.1 membrane's weight firstly increased up to $3 . 6 \%$ after two days,which was mainly due to the absorption of vanadium ions by the membrane with high water uptake.However,with time increasing，the dramatic weight loss of the membrane reached almost $4 . 2 \%$ on the last day, this result indicated that the Im-PAES-1.1 membrane were less stable.As a comparison, the weight changes of Nafion 117 membrane showed a similar trend with Im-PAES-1.1,owing to the unique structure of Nafion 117, the weight loss was $3 . 2 \%$ in 10 days.In these screening experiments,all these membranes showed comparable short-term stability performance to Nafion membranes.Long term stability of these membranes is being further assessed.

# 3.7VRB cell performance

The charge-discharge cycling performance of the VRB cells assembled with Nafion 117 and different Im-PAES membranes were investigated.The coulombic efficiency (CE),voltage effi ciency (VE),energy efficiency (EE) as well as cycling stability were shown in Fig. 6-8,respectively.

From Fig.6,we can see that the CE of VRB cell assembled with Im-PAES-o.7 membrane was slightly higher than that of VRB cell with Nafion 117 membrane at the current densities ranging from 60 to $1 2 0 \mathrm { \ m A } \mathrm { \ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ . The CE curves exhibited an unilateral rising trend with increasing current density,and the highest CE was obtained as $9 6 . 1 \%$ when the current density was $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m A } ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ . This was mainly attributed to the excellent resistance property of Im-PAES-o.7 to vanadium ions.In addition,higher current density could shorten the charge-discharge time and further reduce the self-discharge of VRB cell.As a typical comparison,the Im-PAES-1.1 membrane,with high permeability of vanadium ions,possessed much lower CE value than that of Nafion 117 membrane.Among all the Im-PAES membranes,the Im-PAES-o.5 membrane was originally expected to have good performance in the VRB cell in consideration of its excellent resistance property to vanadium ions. However, the VRB cell assembled with Im-PAES-0.5 membrane can't even conduct charge-discharge cycling process at any current density above $8 0 \ \mathrm { m A } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ .This might be caused by the over-high ohmic polarization from intrinsic low IEC property of Im-PAES-0.5 membrane.

Fig.6Coulombic efficiencies of VRBs with Nafion 117 and Im-PAES membranesunderdifferentcurrent densities.

Fig.7 illustrated the voltage efficiencies (VEs) of VRB cells assembled with Nafion 117 and Im-PAES membranes at different current densities. With the increase of chargedischarge current densities,the VEs of VRB cells with all the membranes exhibited significant decreasing trend,which was caused by the increase of ohmic resistance.Meanwhile,it can befound that the VE value of the VRB cells with Im-PAES-1.1 (from $8 8 . 0 \%$ to $7 7 . 5 \%$ ）and Nafion 117 membrane (from $8 8 . 4 \%$ to $7 7 . 4 \%$ )exhibited almost identical decreasing trend, this might be attributed to their similar area resistances.The VRB cell with Im-PAES-0.7 membrane showed slightly lower VE value than thatofVRB cellwith Im-PAES-1.1membrane from 60 to $1 2 0 \mathrm { \ m A \ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ， $7 5 . 6 \%$ of voltage efficiency was obtained at high current density of $1 2 0 \mathrm { \ m A } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ：

Fig.8Energy efficiencies and cycling durability of VRB cells with Nafion 117 and Im-PAES membranes at different current densities.

Fig.8 revealed the energy efficiencies (EEs)of VRB cells assembled with Im-PAES-0.5/0.7/1.1andNafion117 membranes at the current densities of 60,80，10o，120 mA $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ . It was worth mentioning that average EE value was calculated and recognized as final EE result for every current density.Initially,ata current density of $6 0 \ \mathrm { m A } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ,the EEof cell with Im-PAES-0.7 membrane was slightly higher than that of cell with Nafion 117 ( $8 1 . 7 \%$ vs. $7 8 . 9 \%$ )within first10 cycles. Furthermore,from 80 to $1 2 0 \mathrm { \ m A } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ,the EEs of cell with ImPAES-0.7 ( $7 9 . 0 \%$ ， $7 4 . 8 \%$ ， $7 2 . 5 \%$ )showed the almost same level with that of VRB cell assembled with Nafion 117 $( 7 8 . 6 \%$ ， $7 5 . 0 \%$ $7 3 . 1 \% ]$ .This result supported that the cell with Im-PAES-0.7 membrane possessed as least comparable power density with that of cell with Nafion 117 under different current densities.In contrast,due to the high vanadium permeability and poor chemical stability of Im-PAES-1.1 membrane,lower EE values was obtained, e.g. only $7 6 . 5 \%$ at the current density of $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m A } }$ $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，decreasing dramatically with the increase of current density.

According to Fig.8，stable performance and acceptable energy efficiency were stillachieved in the cell withIm-PAES-0.7 membrane during the last 1O cycles at high current density of $1 2 0 \mathrm { m A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ .This result further indicated that the Im-PAES-0.7 membrane could be comparable to Nafion 117 membrane for applications in VRB cell.

# 4. Conclusion

Insummary， aserialsofimidazolium functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) (Im-PAEs) based anion exchange membranes for application in VRB were prepared in this work. The Im-PAES-0.5/0.7 membranes exhibited much lower vanadium ions permeability compared with Nafion 117 membrane. Meanwhile,among three anion exchange membranes,the highest ionic conductivity (up to $7 3 . 1 ~ \mathrm { m S ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ )andexcellent coulombic efficiency (up to $9 6 . 1 \%$ ) could be achieved when the VRB cell assembled with the Im-PAES-0.7 membrane.The chemical stability test in the strong oxidative ${ \mathrm { V O } _ { 2 } } ^ { + }$ solution and the charge-discharge cycle performance tests at different currentdensitiesdemonstrated thattheIm-PAES-0.7 membrane possess comparable short-term stability to Nafion membranes. Considering all the properties mentioned above, the Im-PAES serials membranes could be potential alternatives for further VRB application.
