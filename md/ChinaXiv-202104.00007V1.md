Abstract Here we report a Hipparion fauna locality discovered in between two basalt layers near Hanjiaying Village,Jining District, Wulanchabu City,Nei Mongol. K-Ar isotopic dating of the lower and upper level of the basalt constrains the age of the fauna from 7.2 to $6 . 8 \ \mathrm { M a }$ .Compared with classical Hipparion fauna from northern China,the Hanjiaying fauna is closer to those from Baode of Shanxi, Siziwang Banner of Nei Mongol and the Linxia Basin of Gansu.It is similar to the Loc.43,44 and 49 from Baode by faunal composition, confirming their age to be ${ \sim } 7 . 0$ Ma rather than $5 . 5 \ \mathrm { M a }$ .The high similarity with the fossils from Wulanhua, Siziwang Banner, Nei Mongol, verified the age of Wulanhua fauna at about 7 Ma.Compared with faunas from the Linxia Basin, Gansu, it is more similar to those from the upper part of the Liushu Formation, especially the Yangjiashan fauna. Based on the faunal composition and their tooth morphology, the Hanjiaying fauna could be included in the“Gazella dorcadoides”fauna,which is supposed to be at the west paleobiome in northern China during the Late Miocene.

Neogene terrestrial depositions in China are well developed and produced a great number of mammal fossls. Among them, the Late Miocene Hipparion faunas have long been extensively explored (Schlosser,1924) and researchers have documented the highest diversification and richness of mammal fossils with more than 140 genera during the Neogene (Zhang et al., 2Oo6). Due to lack of absolute dating materials, the sequencing and biochronology of the faunas were mainly inferred by evolutionary levels of mammals and magnetostratigraphic correlation (Tedford et al.,1991). The discontinuity of the fossil records and short depositional sequences weakened the biochronologic interpretations, hence absolute dating constraints are badly needed. Recently we found a fossil rich locality near Hanjiaying Village, Jining District,Nei Mongol.The fossl horizon is located right in between two basalt layers,which provides ideal conditions for the precise dating of the Hipparion fauna.Detailed analysis of the fauna will improve our understanding of the biochronology of Chinese Late Miocene.

# 1 Geological settings

The fossil locality is situated at the hillside west of Hanjiaying village,about $1 8 \mathrm { k m }$ west of Jining District,Wulanchabu City,Nei Mongol ( $4 1 ^ { \circ } 0 0 . 8 2 5 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ ， $1 1 2 ^ { \circ } 5 3 . 2 3 4 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E }$ (Fig. 1A). Fossils are produced from orange-red mudstone and silty mudstone,and the strata are basically horizontal. The stratigraphic section (Fig.1B) is described from top to bottom as following:

4. Caesious,purplish-grey fine-grained basalt with vasicular and amygdaloidal structure,bedded with multiple eruptive cycles. （204号 ${ \sim } 1 5 \mathrm { m }$

# 2 Mammalian fossils

Fossils collected from the Hanjiaying locality represent 12 species in total: Amphimachairodus giganteus, Rhinocerotinae gen. et sp. indet., Aceratherinae gen. et sp. indet., Hipparion coelophyes,Palaeotragus microdon, Samotherium sp., Dorcadoryx palaeosinensis, Gazella sp., Oioceros sp., Bovidae gen. et sp. indet., Ochotona lagreli,and Erinaceidae gen. et sp. indet.

Most of the above-mentioned mammals are the same as or close to the members of the Baode Fauna,such as Amphimachairodus giganteus,Hipparion coelophyes, Palaeotragus microdon, Samotherium sp.,Dorcadoryx palaeosinensis,and Gazella sp.Amphimachairodus lived from the Late Miocene to the Pleistocene (Liu,2O04). Hipparion coelophyes lived in the Baodean in North China (Liu, 2013). Dorcadoryx lived from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene (MN 11-14) in Mongolia and North China, and Gazella appeared in the early Late Miocene (MN 9) and was widely distributed in North China in the late Late Miocene (Baodean) (Chen and Zhang,2009).

The main characters of the representative taxa from the Hanjiaying fauna are described as following:

# Carnivora, Felidae:

Amphimachairodus giganteus Kretzoi, 1929: There found a juvenile skull fragment (IVPP V 27533.1) and a partial right P4(V 27533.2) (Fig. 2). The infraorbital foramen is large and round; the diastema of I3 and C is short; the I2 cone is shaped, serrated at the medial and lateral edges, with two lingual styles and a cingulum in between them; the upper canine is laterally flat and serrated at the anterior and posterior edges; there is a parastyle anterior to the main cusp on the P3,with serrated crista; the P4 is long and narrow, with two cusps increasingly larger anterior to the main cusp.

# 3 Comparison with other Hipparion faunas from North China

By the faunal composition,the Hanjiaying fauna is a typical Hipparion fauna.There recorded a species of the Felidae.This kind of saber tooth cat is widely recorded in Eurasia during the Late Miocene.There is one species of three-toed horse,two species of the Giraffdae and four species of the Bovidae.The Rhinocerotidae are also richly represented,unfortunately no diagnostic anatomical parts were preserved. Pikas are also very common elements from many Late Miocene localities. However, no deer or pigs,which are also common in many Hipparion faunas,have been found from this locality.

Compared with mammals from locality 30 ( ${ \widetilde { \mathbf { \Gamma } } } { \sim } 5 . 7 \ \mathrm { M a } )$ ,localities 43, 44 and 49 (\~6.5-7.0 Ma) of Baode, Shanxi, the representative localites of the Hipparion fauna (Kaakinen et al., 2013),the Hanjiaying fauna has the same species Amphimachairodus giganteus and Palaeotragus microdon, the same genera Gazell and Dorcadoryx. Brachydont Honanotherium schlosseri appears at locality 49 of Baode, while mesodont Samotherium appears at locality 30 and Hanjiaying fauna (Kaakinen et al.,2Ol3). Hipparion coelophyes has only been recorded in localities 43 and 44.H. plocodus has only been found in locality 49.H. forstenae and $H .$

dermatorhinum both appear at locality 30 (Bernor et al., 1990).

Compared with the Wulanhua fauna $( \sim 7 . 0 \ \mathrm { M a } )$ from Siziwang Banner of Nei Mongol (Deng et al., 2O11), the Hanjiaying fauna has the same species Palaeotragus microdon and Dorcadoryx palaeosinensis,and the same genera Amphimachairodus,Samotherium and Gazella.Without Hipparion coelophyes,the Wulanhua fauna has $H .$ teilhardi instead,which shows some primitive characters, such as the strong crown curvature of the upper tooth crown and the rounded rectangle shape of the protocone. Otherwise Sinohippus robustus, Chilotherium anderssoni, Cervavitus novorossiae, Gazella gaudryi and Plesiaddax depereti only appear in the Wulanhua fauna.

The Hanjiaying fauna has the same species Palaeotragus microdon and the same genera Dorcadoryx, Gazella and Ochotona as the Bahe fauna $( 1 1 - 7 \ \mathrm { M a } )$ ,but these only appear at the top of the Bahe Formation; the same species Palaeotragus microdon,and the same genus Gazella and Hipparionas theLantian fauna $( \mathrm { { \sim } 6 . 6 \ M a ) }$ fromLantian, Shaanxi(Liu et al.,1978; Zhang et al.,2002,2013; Liu,2013). The Bahe fauna has Hipparion weihoense,H. chiai, Dorcadoryx orientalis,Schansitherium,Shaanxispira,Protoryx,Tetralophodon,which are not present in the Hanjiaying fauna. The two species of hipparionine from the Bahe fauna suggest an earlier age than that of the Hanjiaying fauna.Also,Dorcadoryx orientalis from the Bahe fauna may be an early form of the genus Dorcadoryx (Chen,2Oo5). Compared to the Lantian fauna,Samotherium, Dorcadoryx and Oioceros were recovered from the Hanjiaying fauna. The Lantian fuana contains a large number of deer and pig materials (Zhang et al., 2013).

Compared with faunas from the Liushu Formation of the Linxia Basin in Gansu (Deng et al., 2004a, 20l3), the Hanjiaying fauna has the same species Amphimachairodus giganteus, Hipparion coelophyes and Palaeotragus microdon,and genus Gazella as the Yangjiashan fauna, the upper part of the Liushu Formation $( { \sim } 8 \ M \mathrm { a } )$ . It does not share any members with the Qingbushan fauna, the top of the Liushu Formation ( ${ \widetilde { \mathbf { \Gamma } } } { \sim } 6 . 5 ~ \mathrm { M a } )$ . Compare to the Qingbushan fauna, the Yangjiashan fauna shows a closer similarity with the Hanjiaying fauna.

The Hanjiaying fauna has the same genera of Hipparion,Palaeotragus,Samotherium and Gazella as the Lamagou fauna $( { \sim } 7 . 8 \mathrm { M a } )$ from Fugu, Shaanxi; the same genera Hipparion, Samotherium,and Gazella as the Taohuapo fauna ( ${ \widetilde { \mathbf { \Gamma } } } { \sim } 6 . 7 \ : \mathrm { M a } ,$ fromLingtai County, Gansu (Xue et al.,1995,20o6).Among them, Hipparion chiai from the Lamagou fauna shows its earlier age. Except for the genera shared with the Hanjiaying fauna, others from the Taohuapo fauna are very different.

# 4 Discussion

Based on the distribution of Chinese Neogene mammalian faunas, Early Miocene and Middle Miocene faunas are ecologically different in a west-east direction, with dense forests in eastern areas contrasted with open grasslands in western areas. However, since the early Late Miocene,the dense eastern forests were sparser and many had turned into woodlands, so the paleobiome boundary between eastern and western China was not as easy to distinguish (Tong et al.,1996; Qiu and Li, 2004; Deng et al.,2011). The later Late Miocene shows the apparent differentiation of a humid and closed fauna in the east and a dry and open fauna in the west (Kurtén, 1952; Zhang, 2006). The components of the Hanjiaying fauna, with Amphimachairodus giganteus,Palaeotragus microdon,Samotherium etc., show that this fauna should belong to the Gazella dorcadoides fauna, which were distributed at the west part of northern China (Kurtén,1952).

The Hipparion red clay from the Baode area of Shanxi, which produced the classical Baode fauna, has long been investigated and studied. Based on detailed stratigraphic work, Kaakinen et al. (2O13) concluded an ecological boundary shifting within the time-space continuum,contrary to the temporal or spatial explanation of the faunal differences for the Baode localities.The Baode area was then located at the east of paleobiome boundary at ${ \sim } 7 . 0$ Ma represented by locality 49,at west of the boundary at ${ \sim } 5 . 7$ Ma represented by locality 30 due to the shifting of the eastern boundary (Kaakinen et al.,2Ol3). Located northeastern to Baode,the Jining area should have been in the eastern ecolological regime according the northeast-southwest ecological gradient suggested by isotopic data (Passey et al., 2009) at ${ \sim } 7 \ \mathrm { M a }$ .The higher latitude and high elevation of the Jining area,which is in the Mongolian Plateau,may explain its western ecological characteristics.The high similarity of the faunal composition at the locality 49 and the Hanjiaying locality verifies the geological age of locality 49 at about $7 . 0 \mathrm { M a }$ ,rather than $5 . 5 \mathrm { M a }$ as previously thought (Deng et al.,2004b).

Based on the faunal components, Deng et al.(2O11) inferred the Wulanhua fauna from Siziwang Banner of Nei Mongol at about $7 \ \mathrm { M a }$ .This region was a typical steppe and is located to the west of the paleobiome boundary between eastern and western China during the Late Miocene. The Wulanhua fauna has many similarities with the Hanjiaying fauna,which confirms its age estimation at about $7 \mathrm { M a }$ .These two localities are close geographically and all belong to the western faunas.

The age of the Hanjiaying fauna is between those of the Bahe $\mathrm { ( 1 1 - 7 \ M a ) }$ and Lantian faunas $( \sim 6 . 6 \ \mathrm { M a } )$ (Zhang et al.,2oo2). The components of the Hanjiaying fauna are not significantly similar to the Bahe and Lantian fauna,which corresponds to the habitat differences because of the long distance between Jining and Lantian geographically.

The Hanjiaying fauna is closer to the Yangjiashan fauna $( { \sim } 8 \ \mathrm { M a } )$ than is it to the Qingbushan fauna $( { \sim } 6 . 5 \mathrm { M a } )$ from Linxia Basin, Gansu (Deng et al.,2O13). This phenomenon shows there are large differences between the members of the MN12 and MN13 in North China faunas.

There are few similarities between the Hanjiaying fauna and the Lamagou fauna from Fugu, Shaanxi, and the Taohuapo fauna from Lingtai, Gansu (Xue et al., 1995, 2006). This may correspond to the differences of their age and location respectively.

# 5 Conclusion

Hipparion faunas first occurred during the early Late Miocene and lived through the whole Late Miocene,but the numerical dating is still in its infancy. The discovery of the Hanjiaying fauna helped fill this gap in the timeline and provides strong evidence for the paleomagnetic dating of other faunas.By K-Ar isotopic dating of the basalt layers it is sandwiched in between, the age of the Hanjiaying fauna is $7 . 2 { - } 6 . 8 \ \mathrm { M a }$ .The Hanjiaying fauna is a typical Hipparion fauna, dominated by Hipparion and Gazella,but does not include the Hyaenidae and Cervidae.There are some other faunas,like those in Baode localities 43,44, 49 and the Wulanhua fauna, which have members similar to the Hanjiaying fauna.Based on the taxa and their tooth pattern, the Hanjiaying fauna should belong to the Gazella dorcadoides fauna,located west of the boundary between the eastern and western ecological regimes in North China during the Late Miocene.
