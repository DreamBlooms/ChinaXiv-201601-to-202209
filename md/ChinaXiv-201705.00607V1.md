# ABSTRACT

Ultrathin carbon foams with the thickness about $2 4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ were fabricated by the pyrolysis of polyimide/ graphene composite foams.The addition of graphene was verified to stabilize the porous structure of the foams and accelerate their graphitization process simultaneously.Consequently,the well-defined carbon foams exhibited much higher electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efectiveness (SE)up to 24 dB over the frequency range of $8 { \mathrm { - } } 1 2 ~ { \mathrm { G H z } }$ ,in comparison with the non-foamed counterparts.The possible mechanism behind the phenomenon was atributed to their enhanced microwave absorption via the internal multiple scattering and reflections.Moreover,the SE could be further improved to 43 and 51 dB byincreasing the sample thickness gradually to 51 and $7 3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,respectively.The carbon foams with high thermal stability are very promising in the fabrication of ultrathin EMI shields for thermall harsh applications.

# 1.Introduction

The rapid increase of wireless communication devices (e.g smartphones,laptop computers and wireless routers）has caused severe electromagnetic pollution to their surroundings,threatening information securityand human beings' health.Therefore,electromagnetic interference (EMI） shielding materials are eagerly needed [1].Metals are the most common EMl shields,but they always suffer from large density,poor resistance to corrosion and expensive cost to process.As alternatives,carbon materials,such as carbon black,carbon fibers (CFs),carbon nanofibers (CNFs),carbon nanotubes(CNTs) and graphene,have been explored and blended with polymers as conductive fillers for the purpose of fabricating lightweight and tough polymer-based shielding materials.Particularly, the fillers with high aspect ratio like CNTs and graphene are more preferred,due to the skin effect which refers to the phenomenon that high-frequency EM waves tend to interact with the near surface region of a shield [2,3].

Recently, the EMI shielding materials with strong absorption have drawn considerable attention due to their weak secondary reflection[4].In the fabrication of such materials,some researchers prefer to fabricate polymer-based shielding foams [5-9]. In foaming shields,conductive fillers are concentrated in the cell walls, which enhances the internal multiple scattering and reflections, and eventually their EMI shielding performance.Moreover, porous structure can also render these materials with low density,high flexibility and excellent impact resistance [1O].For example,the polypropylene(PP)/10 vol.%CF composite foam fabricated by Ameli etal.using foam injectionmoldingabsorbed approximately $81 \%$ incident EM energy,which was about $1 0 \%$ higher than that of the solid counterpart [11]. Owing to the enhanced absorption,the foam exhibited an effective shielding effectiveness(SE) of25dB over the frequency range of $8 { \mathrm { - } } 1 2 \operatorname { G H z }$ (the X band range),much higher than that of the solid (2O dB). Similar phenomenon was also observed in PP/stainless-steel fiber foams [12].Additionally, Ling et al. fabricated microcellular polyetherimide(PEI)/graphene foams byphase separation and the results revealed that about $9 0 . 6 \substack { - 9 8 . 9 \% }$ incident EM energy was absorbed by the foams,which was much higher than the $7 6 . 2 \mathrm { - } 9 0 . 8 \%$ for the solids in control [13].

Despite the great progress in polymer-based shielding materials, there are still some issues needing to be settled.Since a high electrical conductivity is necessary for high-performance EMI shielding materials,most current polymers are electrically insulating.Thereby,most polymer-based composites including solids and foams require both a high filler loading $( \geq 1 0 \ \mathrm { w t } . \% )$ to form effective conductive networks and a large thickness $( { \geq } 2 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ to meet the commercial level of 20 dB[1O-2O]. Consequently, the excessive filler raises significant diffculties in processing,while the large thickness increases the volume of the shields,making them unavailable for the application of microelectronics.Moreover, the low thermal stability of polymers,as well as their weak flame retardation,also makes the resulting materials unable to work continuously,for some absorbed EM energy can be transformed into heat and lead to fire.With modern electronics getting smaller, thinnerand faster,it has posedachallenge to fabricate lightweight and effective EMI shielding materials with low thickness,high thermal stability and strong microwave absorption.

Carbon-based materials,such as flexible graphite,CNT and graphene papers,have superior thermal and electrical properties. When utilized as EMI shields,these materials generally exhibit effectiveSE $: 2 0$ dB） in extremelylow sample thickness $( 0 . 0 2 - 0 . 7 9 \ \mathrm { m m } )$ ）[21-24].More importantly, the SE still remains excellent under thermally harsh conditions [25-27]. These unique properties make them good candidates in replacing polymer-based materials for EMI shielding application.After made into hydrogels andaerogels,carbon-based compositesare fairly promising in energy storage，gas separation and catalyst beds [28-33]. More recently,porous carbon-based shields with ultralow density for EMI shielding have been reported.For example,with a template method,Chen et al.prepared poly(dimethyl siloxane） (PDMS) coating graphene foams in which the graphene skeleton was made by chemical vapor deposition(CVD)[34]. The as-prepared foam with low density of $0 . 0 6 \ \mathrm { g } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ exhibited a SE of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { d B }$ in a low thickness of $1 \ \mathrm { m m }$ .Due to the synergetic effect of electrical conductivity and multiple reflections,most carbon-based shielding foams possessed anabsorption-predominant shieldingmechanism [34-36]. These results convince us that carbon foams may be a good option to fulfill our target of fabricating lightweight EMI shieldswith low thickness,effective SE and strong microwave absorption for thermally harsh applications.Moreover,the porous structure may also render themselves with other functions like energy storage [37].

Aromatic polyimides(PIs）are commonly employed as carbon precursors to prepare carbon foams,due to their high carbon yield (to guarantee sufficient residues),solid-state carbonization(to keep the shape of the precursor) and better-defined molecular structure thanpitches (to obtain more simple carbonization behavior and high quality carbon products) [38,39]. One commercially available aromatic PI film“Kapton"is very prevailing in the manufacture of high quality graphite films,due to its flat molecule structure,high degree of molecular orientation and simple release of noncarbon atoms during carbonization and graphitization [4O-42].As the film issynthesized by anhydride and diamine,thus pyromellitic dianhydride（PMDA）and $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -oxydiamine (ODA)，it is also called PMDA/ODA type PI.To date,several kinds of carbon foams have already been obtained from PMDA/ODA type PI by thermal decomposition,but the heat treatment temperatures (HTTs) during the processare relatively low ( $\langle \leq 1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \rangle$ and their applications are frequently limited to gas absorption and catalytic supports [38,43-46].Therefore,it is interesting to study the carbonization and graphitization behaviors of the foamsat much higherHTTsand investigate their EMI shieldingperformance simultaneously.

In our previous Work [47],microcellular PMDA/ODA type $\mathsf { P I } /$ graphene composite foams(PIGFs)were fabricated by the combination of in situ polymerization and phase separation.Based on this,we prepared carbon foams in this work by thermally decomposing the PIGFs at various temperatures ranging from 1000 to $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ Graphene was used to stabilize the porous structure of the foams and accelerate their graphitization process,for we found that graphene could effectively suppress the shrinkage of PI film during its pyrolysis and even possibly accelerate its graphitization process [48].As a result,the as-obtained ultrathin carbon foams with welldefined porous structure exhibited effective SE and excellent thermal stability.By comparing the SE of the foamswith that of the solid counterparts,we found that porous structure is greatly necessary for fabricating EMI shielding materialswith strong microwave absorption.

# 2.Experimental

# 2.1.Materials

Graphite oxide was synthesized via a modified Hummers method [49].PMDA,ODA and N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (China).All chemicals were used as received without further purification.

# 2.2.Fabrication of Pl/graphene composite precursors

The preparation of PIGFs was similar to our previous report [47]. In the typical procedure (Fig.1),graphite oxide was dispersed in DMF and fully exfoliated into graphene oxide(GO) with the help of ultrasonication for $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ .ODA and PMDA monomers in equal moleratio were added subsequently to synthesize poly(amic acid) (PAA), the precursor of PI.The solid content was about $10 \%$ .The synthesized PAA/GO casting solution was then cast on a glass substrate and immediately impregnated into a coagulant bath composed of alcohol and distilled water(with a volume ratio of 1:1) for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ,in order to obtain microcellular PAA/GO foam. The $\mathsf { P A A } /$ GO foam was then dried at $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ and furtherthermally imidized at $3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ,during which PAA was transformed into PI and GO was reduced to graphene.Consequently,PIGFs with graphene loading of 0,1,2and4wt $\%$ were prepared and termed as PIGFO, PIGF1,PIGF2 and PIGF4,respectively.The thickness for the PIGFs was about $4 5 \ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$

Ascontrol,PI/graphene solids(PIGSs) were also prepared by the direct thermal imidization of PAA/GO casting solutions on glass substrate.As a result,PIGSs including PIGSO,PIGS1,PIGS2 and PIGS4 were prepared and their thickness was about $1 2 \ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ Here need to mention that the PIGFs had an identical compressed thickness with that of PIGSs.All the samples were used as precursors and ready for carbonization and graphitization.

# 2.3.Carbonization and graphitization of Pl/graphene composites

In this process,PIGFs and PIGSs were sandwiched among artificial polished graphite platesand pyrolyzed at the temperatures of 1000,1500,2100 and $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C } .$ ,respectively,in flowing high purity nitrogen.For each temperature,the samples were cured for $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$

# 3.Characterization

# 3.1. Scanning electron microscopy

The scanning electron microscopy(SEM) observation was performed with a Hitachi S-48oo field emission SEM at an accelerating voltage of $8 ~ \mathrm { k V } .$ Prior to the observation,all samples needed to be freeze-fractured with liquid nitrogen to obtain flat cross-section.

The as-obtained samples were then dried at $1 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 2 h }$ to remove residual water as much as possible and coated with platinum.The cell density $( N _ { 0 } )$ ，thus the number of cells per cubic centimeter,was determined from SEM micrographs and calculated using the equation as follows [50]:

$$
N _ { 0 } = [ \mathrm { n M } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { A } ] ^ { 3 / 2 } \times \Phi
$$

where n is the number of cells in the SEM image,Mis the magnification factor,A is the area of micrograph $( \mathsf { c m } ^ { 2 } )$ ，and $\phi$ is the expansion ratio and can be expressed as:

$$
\Phi = \boldsymbol \rho / \rho \mathrm { { f } }
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of solid materials and $\rho _ { \mathrm { f } }$ is the density of foaming materials. In this study，the density was calculated geometrically.

# 3.2. X-ray diffraction

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted using aBruker AXS X-ray diffractometer with Cu $\mathrm { K } \alpha$ radiation $\langle \lambda = 0 . 1 5 4 1 7 8 \mathrm { n m } \rangle$ atthe generator voltage of $4 0 \mathrm { k V }$ and the current of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { { m A } }$ The diffraction patterns of all samples were recorded at room temperature in the $2 \theta$ ranging from 10 to $8 0 ^ { \circ }$ .The curves needed to be calibrated with silicone powder before use.The interlayer spacing of (Oo2) plane $d _ { 0 0 2 }$ Was calculated by Bragg's law [51]:

$$
d = \lambda / 2 s \mathrm { i n } \theta
$$

where $\lambda$ is 0.154178 nm.The through-plane crystalline size $L _ { \mathrm { c } } ,$ the stacking thickness of graphene layer along the $c$ -axis,wasestimated with $\beta _ { 0 0 2 }$ (the half width of the(Oo2）reflection） via the Debye-Scherrer formula [52]:

$$
L _ { \mathrm { c } } = 0 . 8 9 \lambda / \beta \mathrm { c o s } \Theta
$$

# 3.3.Raman spectra

The Raman spectra were excited with a laser of $5 3 2 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and recorded withLabramspectrometerintherangeof

$1 0 0 0 { - } 3 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ .The in-plane crystalline size $L _ { \mathrm { a } }$ ，the graphitic coherent domains perpendicular to the $c$ -axis,wascalculated from the ratio of Raman intensities (integrated areas) $\mathrm { I _ { D } / I _ { G } }$ with the coefficient $\mathsf C ( \lambda )$ of $4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ [52].

$$
L _ { \mathsf { a } } = \mathsf { C } ( \lambda ) / ( \mathrm { I } _ { \mathrm { D } } / \mathrm { I } _ { \mathrm { G } } )
$$

# 3.4.Electrical conductivity

The electrical conductivity of polymers composites was examined by an EST121 ultrahigh resistance and microcurrent meter (Beijing EST Science & Technology CO.Ltd.）accordingto ASTMD257,while that of carbonized and graphitized samples was recorded usinga standard four-probe method ona Napson Cresbox Measurement System.

# 3.5.EMI shieldingperformance

The EMI SE was measured with a R&S ZVA67 vector network analyzer(VNA)in the X band using the wave guide.All samples werecutintorectangleplateswithadimensionof $2 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m } \times 1 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ to fit the sample holder.The thickness of the PIGFs heat-treated at $2 6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ gained from the SEM images was about $2 4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ，while that for the graphitized PIGFs was $7 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ All these values were obtained from the measurement of their SEM images.

The EMI SE $( S \mathrm { E _ { T } } )$ refers to the logarithm of the ratio of incoming power $( P _ { i } )$ to transmitted power $\left( P _ { t } \right)$ of radiation,which is the sum of the absorption $( \mathsf { S E } _ { \mathsf { A } } )$ ,the reflection $( \mathsf { S E } _ { \mathbb { R } } )$ and the multiple reflections $\cdot S \mathrm { E _ { M } } )$ [19]:

$$
\mathrm { S E _ { T } } = 1 0 \log ( P _ { i } / P _ { t } ) = \mathrm { S E _ { A } } + \mathrm { S E _ { R } } + \mathrm { S E _ { M } }
$$

The power coefficients of reflectivity (R), transmissivity $( T )$ ,and absorptivity(A) are determined using S parameters $( S _ { 1 1 } , S _ { 2 2 } , S _ { 1 2 }$ and $S _ { 2 1 , }$ )with the equationsas follows [53]:

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { R = \left| S _ { 1 1 } \right| ^ { 2 } = \left| S _ { 2 2 } \right| ^ { 2 } } } \\ { { } } \\ { { T = \left| S _ { 1 2 } \right| ^ { 2 } = \left| S _ { 2 1 } \right| ^ { 2 } } } \\ { { } } \\ { { R + T + A = 1 } } \end{array}
$$

In the case of $S \mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { T } } \geq 1 5$ dB, $S \mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { M } }$ is usually neglected and $S \mathrm { E _ { T } }$ can be simplified as:

$$
{ \sf S E } _ { \mathrm { T } } \approx { \sf S E } _ { \mathrm { A } } + { \sf S E } _ { \mathrm { R } }
$$

The corresponding effective absorptivity $( A _ { \mathrm { { e f f } } } )$ = $S { \mathrm { E } } _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ can be written as:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { A _ { \mathrm { e f f } } = ( 1 - R - T ) / ( 1 - R ) } \\ & { } \\ & { \mathrm { S E } _ { \mathrm { R } } = - 1 0 \mathrm { l o g } \left( 1 - R \right) } \\ & { \mathrm { S E } _ { \mathrm { A } } = - 1 0 \mathrm { l o g } \left( 1 - A _ { \mathrm { e f f } } \right) = - 1 0 \mathrm { l o g } \left[ T / ( 1 - R ) \right] } \end{array}
$$

Additionally, the skin depth(δ)of a shield,defined as the depth at which electromagnetic energy drops exponentially to $1 / e$ of its incident value,was roughly evaluated according to the following relation [2]:

$$
\mathfrak { d } = ( \pi \sigma f \mu ) ^ { - 1 / 2 }
$$

where $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, $f$ is the frequency and $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability.

# 3.6.Thermal stability

The thermal stability of the PIGFs heat-treated at $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ was measured with a Mettler-Toledo TG/DSC1 analyzer (Switzerland) from 100 to $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ at a heating rate of $2 0 \ ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } \ { \mathsf { m i n } } ^ { - 1 }$ under an oxidative(air)atmosphere.

# 4.Results and discuss

# :1.Carbonization and graphitization behaviors ofPIGFs

Previous reports reveal that an abrupt weight decrease will happen to Kapton type PI film during its pyrolysis process,due to the release of decomposition gases like CO, ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ ,and ${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ [39,54]. Furthermore,this process isalways accompanied by pronounced shrinkage along the film.For example,about $1 5 \mathrm { - } 1 8 \%$ liner shrinkage has been reported for thearomaticPI films carbonized at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } ,$ which corresponds to the $3 9 - 4 5 \%$ volumetric shrinkage [55].The large shrinkage could possibly cause the collapse of the porous structure of PI foam during its pyrolysis process.Therefore, graphene was introduced to stabilize the porous structure.To verify its feasibility,PIGF4 was initially selected as a representative sample and its structure evolution at varying HTTs was investigated.

As shown in Fig.2,the porous structure of PIGF4 is well preserved,even when the HTT is up to $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } .$ Moreover,the whole process can be divided into three stages in terms of HTTs: $3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ $1 0 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } } ,$ and $2 1 0 0 { \mathrm { - } } 2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } }$ .The HTT of $3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ corresponds to primary PIGF4,which shows an average cell size of $1 . 8 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and a cell density of $3 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ cells $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ . After the carbonization in the HTT range of $1 0 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ these values marginally become to ca. $1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and $5 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ cells $\mathsf { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ ,indicating a slight shrinkage in the foam.This is quite different from the large shrinkage in pristine PI film[39],possibly due to the rigid structure of graphene that has significantly restrained the shrinkage of PIGF4.Furthermore,the smooth fracture in the magnified SEM images also suggests the brittle feature of the carbonized samples.

When the HTT further increases to $2 1 0 0 { \mathrm { - } } 2 6 0 0 \ { \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C } } ,$ pronounced shrinkage is observed,as supported by the distinct changes in the values of cell size (ca. $0 . 6 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } } ;$ and cell density (ca. $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 3 }$ cells $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } .$ ).According to previous report [56],a thinning process is often observed in the thickness of Kapton film during its graphitization process.Therefore,the large shrinkage may be assigned to the occurrence of graphitization of PIGF4.Moreover,a sharp brittletough transition isalso observed in their SEM imageswith higher magnification,further confirming the development of graphitic structure[57].In thewhole process,the density increases gradually from $0 . 4 \dot { 0 } \ \mathrm { ~ g ~ } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ for primary PIGF4 to $0 . { \dot { 6 } } 1 \ \mathrm { ~ g ~ } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ for the carbonized samples,and consequently to $0 . 7 2 \ \mathrm { ~ g ~ } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ for the graphitized ones.

In Fig.3a,XRD patterns were employed to make more detailed investigation.For primary PIGF4,there are three typical peaksat $2 \theta = 1 4 . 7 4 ^ { \circ }$ ， $2 2 . 4 4 ^ { \circ }$ and $2 6 . 4 8 ^ { \circ }$ ,suggesting the high degree of the orientation of PI molecules,which laysa good foundation for the following carbonization and graphitization of PIGF4 [58-6O]. After the carbonization at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } ,$ ，PIGF4 is converted into amorphous carbon,as proved by the two broad peaks at around $2 \theta = 2 5 . 7 ^ { \circ }$ (002)and $4 3 . 6 ^ { \circ }$ (100).When the HTT further increases to $1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ the arrangement of the basic structural units(BSUs) in carbonized PIGF4 is considerably improved.Furthermore,the unsymmetrical (002）peak is related to the varying degree of the orientation of BSUs [61].After the graphitization above $2 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ ，the main peak (002) becomes much sharper and shifts to higher angles,indicating the higher degree of the orientation of BSUs.Specifically,the interlayerspacing $d _ { 0 0 2 }$ for the PIGF4 graphitized at $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ reaches to $0 . 3 3 8 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，This value is comparable to the value of graphite crystal $( 0 . 3 3 8 6 \mathrm { n m } ^ { \cdot }$ )achievedbyKonno etal.fromPMDA/ODA type PI at $2 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [62],probably owing to the catalytic effect of graphene on the graphitization process of PI.With the HTT up to $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ the $d _ { 0 0 2 }$ decreases to $0 . 3 3 7 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，veryapproaching to that of ideal graphite $( 0 . 3 3 5 4 \mathrm { n m } )$ .

In Fig.3b,Raman spectra were recorded to investigate the graphitization degree of PIGF4.Apparently,each Raman spectrum involves the G-band (associated with the stretching of $\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ -hybridized carbon atoms in graphitic 2D hexagonal lattice）at $1 5 8 0 { - } 1 5 9 5 \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and the D-band (associated with the sheering of $\mathsf { s p } ^ { 3 }$ -hybridized carbon atoms in amorphous carbon and defects)at $1 3 2 0 { - } 1 3 3 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ alike [63]. The intensity ratio of the D-band to Gband $\left( \mathrm { I _ { D } / I _ { G } } \right)$ inverse to the average size of crystalline carbon,was calculated after peak separation.As seen, the $\mathrm { I _ { D } / I _ { G } }$ increases with theincrease in HTT.Moreover, the G-band shifts gradually from $1 5 9 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for the sample treated at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ to $1 5 8 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for that at $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } .$ All the results demonstrate the increased ordered domains of carbon layers in the pyrolyzed sample.Besides,in the second-order Raman spectra,the intensity of the symmetric Gband at around $2 6 6 0 \mathsf { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ increases progressively at elevated HTTs. As we know, the nature graphite with AB stacking possesses a highlyasymmetric G-band that can be fitted into two Lorentz peaks [1]. The G-band in our graphitized samples (Fig.3b),however,is only one single peak,indicating the coexistence of crystalline and turbostratic structures.

Generally speaking,the pyrolysis of our PIGFs is composed of the carbonization and graphitization process.The carbonization process can further be divided into two portions: the pyrolysis of Pl molecules and carbonization.The former usually occurs over the HTTrange of $5 0 0 { - } 7 0 0 ^ { \circ } { C }$ and is due to the breakage of the carbonyl groups in the imide part and the ether oxygen in the bridging part, while the latter results mainly from the decomposition of the imide groups in PI molecule at the temperature over $7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [39,64]. This process is usually accompanied byan abrupt decrease in weight,a sudden increase in density and an evolution of a large amount of decomposition gases.Moreover, the stacking of the carbon layers is turbostratic,even after the carbonization at $1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ It is not until the HTTabove $2 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ that turbostratic carbon begins to transform into crystalline graphite,giving rise to the partially graphitization of PIGFs.According to the graphitization mechanism of Kapton film proposed by Bourgerette et al.[56], tiny pores are often formed in the stacks of turbostratic carbon layers that are flattened along the film surface with HTT approaching to the graphitization temperature.Once the pores collapsing,the turbostratic structure is suddenly transformed into graphitic,initializing the graphitization process.If the HTT further increases,the graphitic structure will be continuously developeduntil the arrival oftheperfect graphitization.

# 4.2.Influence of graphene on the carbonization and graphitization process ofPIGFs

To further confirm the assumption that graphene has stabilized the porous structure of PIGFs during their pyrolysis,the SEM images of the samples heat-treated at 350,1500 and $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ ，have been shown in Fig.4.For PIGF precursors,the cell density in Fig. $_ { 4 \mathsf { a } - \mathsf { d } }$ tends to increasewith graphene content increasing,fairly similar to our previous work [47].Particularly, the samples with more graphene sheets display rough cell walls(dotted circles in Fig.4c and d).When carbonized at $1 5 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ the foams exhibit smaller cell size and higher cell density (Fig. 4e-h).For example, the average cell size of the carbonized PIGFO decreases from 1.9 to $1 . 4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ,about $2 6 \%$ decrease,while the corresponding cell density increases from $1 . 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ to $5 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ cells $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ ,about $20 \%$ increase.In the case of carbonized PIGF1,these changes dramatically decrease to $1 1 \%$ for the cell size and $60 \%$ for the cell density.Further increasing graphene content may lead to much smaller change in both parameters.These phenomena demonstrate that the rigid structure of graphene does certainly have suppressed the shrinkage of PI foam during the carbonization process.

After the graphitization at $2 6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ the cell size decreases to about $0 . 6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and the cell density increases to $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 3 }$ cells $\mathsf { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ = Some cell deformation (the dotted circles in Fig.4i) is observed in graphitized PIGFO,because of the more compact stacking of carbon layers.By comparing Fig.4i-l,it is found that the graphitized samples with higher graphene content have a better-defined porous structure,fulfilling our original design of using graphene to stabilize the porous structure of carbon foams.In addition, ductile fracture,as well as layer-like structure,isobserved in Fig. $4 \mathsf { n { - } p }$ ,instead of in Fig. $4 \mathrm { m }$ .It is possibly due to the catalytic effect of graphene on the graphitization of PI,but more evidences areneeded forthis hypothesis.

Fig.5 gives the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of the PIGFs treatedat 1500 and $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ,respectively.As shown in Fig.5a,the PIGFs carbonized $1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ generally exhibit sharper(Oo2） diffraction after the incorporation of graphene.Meanwhile,the peak position shifts gradually to higher angles as well.Furthermore,the corresponding $\mathrm { I _ { D } / I _ { G } }$ ratio in Raman spectra(Fig.5b） shows a decreasing tendency with increasing graphene content,and the Gband red shifts gradually from 1599.4 to $1 5 9 3 . 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ . Similar phenomena are also observed in the subsequent graphitization process,as shown in Fig.5c and d.To quantitatively analyze the changes in graphitized PIGFs,Table 1 lists their structure parameters.It is evident that the interlayer spacing $d _ { 0 0 2 }$ ，through-plane crystallite size $L _ { \mathrm { c } }$ ,in-plane crystallite size $L _ { \mathrm { a } }$ and the full width at half maximum(FWHM) of G-band are largely dependent on the content of graphene.Generally, the more the graphene in PI precursor,the higher the graphitization degree of the resultant graphitized samples.All the results demonstrate that graphene has a catalytic effect on the graphitization process of PI.

It has been said that the internal stress in the composite materials made of carbon fillers and carbon precursors can promote their graphitization process [65,66].Actually,most of the internal stress exists in the interfaces between the fller and precursors, which can be substantially accumulated during carbonization. Therefore,their graphitization frequently starts from the interfaces [65].In this study, the biaxial stretching may be developed from PI matrix to graphene filler in the fabrication of PIGFs [47]. Furthermore,the rigid structure of graphene,as well as its large surface area,can effectively suppress the shrinkage of PI during thermal imidization and carbonization process [47,48],which causes the significant accumulation of internal stress on the interfaces between PI and graphene.Consequently, the graphitization process of our PIGFs was accelerated by graphene.

# 4.3.Electrical conductivity

The electrical conductivity of shielding materials has an intimate connection with their EMI shielding performance [2,3]. Thereby,the electrical conductivityof thePIGFs treatedatdifferent HTTswas tested before the measurementof the EMI SE.Since PI is an excellent electrical insulator,PIGFO shows an extremely low electrical conductivity of $3 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 8 } \mathrm { ~ S ~ c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (Fig. 6a). After the additionof graphene,several orders ofmagnitude are observed in their conductivity，owing to the construction of conductive networkin PI matrix.Once the foamsarecarbonized at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } ,$ their conductivity will be noticeably increased by more than five orders of magnitude.This increment isa direct reflection of the structure change in PI chains,for the pyrolysis of PI molecules and its carbonization usually occur during this process [67].With the HTTfurther increasing to $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ arelativelyslight increase,about one order of magnitude,can be observed in the conductivity. The reason is due to their more compact stacking of carbon layers at elevated HTTs,which mayreduce the electrical interfaceresistance among adjacent carbon layers and cause the conductivity increment.

Fig.6b compares the in-plane electrical conductivity of graphitized PIGFs and PIGSs.The conductivity for graphitized PIGSO is $1 4 0 \thinspace \mathrm { S } \thinspace \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ,while that for graphitized PIGS1 dramatically increases to $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { ~ S ~ c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ,more than one order of magnitude.With graphene content further increasing,less increase is still observed until the

conductivity reaches to $2 3 0 0 \mathsf { S c m } ^ { - 1 }$ .The reason may be ascribed to the catalytic effect of graphene on the graphitization process of Pl. In contrast, the electrical properties of graphitized PIGFs are quite different.For example,the conductivity for graphitized PIGFs is about $1 0 0 S \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ,and the addition of graphene just exerts marginal impact on the conductivity.Additionally, the conductivity values of the foams are lower than those of the solids,which can be ascribed to their porous structure that may partially inhibit the ordered stacking of the carbon layers in the direction parallel to the surface of the foams and cause the increase in their contact resistance.

# 4.4.EMI shielding performance

To obtain suffcient EMI SE,we chose PIGF4 as an optimum carbon precursor and the shielding performance of the resultant carbon foams obtained at various HTTs was measured using the VNA in Fig. 7a. As shown in Fig. 7b,the foams generally exhibit much higher SE at elevated HTTs.Furthermore,the corresponding $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ and $S { \mathrm { E } } _ { \mathrm { R } }$ at $9 . 0 \mathsf { G H z }$ are given in Fig.7c,where a great transition from reflection- to absorption-dominant shielding mechanism is observed with the increase in HTT.The main reason is due to their increased electrical conductivity at higher HTTs.As the conductivity is inversely proportional to the square of skin depth,a slight increase in the conductivity may result ina large decrease in the skin depth of ashield,and eventuallyan enhancement in itsabsorption contribution $S \mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { A } }$ [68].For example,the skin depth for the foam carbonized at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ is approximately $2 6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ at $8 . 0 \mathsf { G H z }$ ,while for the sample at $2 6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ，thisvalue decreases obviously to about $1 5 \ { \mu \mathrm { m } } .$ Theskin depth decrement has significantly enhanced their $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ that is proportional to the skin depth [68]. Consequently, the foam exhibitsaSEashighas $2 4 \mathrm { d B }$ in the low thickness of $2 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ as well as the absorption-dominant shielding mechanism.

In Fig.7d,the SE of the PIGFs graphitized at $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ is presented, in order to investigate the influence of graphene on the SE of the foams.As seen,the SE of graphitized PIGFsis highly dependent on the embedded graphene content. For instance,the average SE of graphitized PIGFO is about $1 3 \mathrm { d B }$ in the X band region. In the case of graphitized PIGF1, this value marginally increases to 15 dB.If more graphene isadded,the SE can be dramatically improved to $2 0 \mathrm { d B }$ for graphitized PIGF2 and $2 4 ~ \mathrm { d B }$ for graphitized PIGF4,respectively. Further investigation reveals that the effective absorptivity $A _ { \mathrm { e f f } }$ at $9 . 0 ~ \mathrm { G H z }$ is O.84 for graphitized PIGFO,indicating that about $84 \%$ incident electromagnetic energy has been absorbed by the sample. For graphitized PIGF1, this value is O.88.And much higher graphene content will cause a sudden increase in the $A _ { \mathrm { { e f f } } } ,$ thus 0.96 for graphitized PIGF2 and O.98 for graphitized PIGF4.These results demonstrate that the difference in the SE of graphitized PIGFsresults mainly from the absorption contribution.Since the electrical conductivity of graphitized PIGFs is almost in the same level,the higher SE is possibly attributed to the better-defined porous structureat higher graphene content (Fig.4k and l),which isable to significantly enhance their microwave absorption via the internal multiple reflections and scattering[2,10,11].

To further confirm the above assumption,the SE values of the non-foamed counterparts,the PIGSs graphitized at $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C } .$ were also researched.The resultin Fig.7e shows that,with the graphene content increasing,the SE of graphitized PIGSs also exhibits an increasing tendency ranging from around 12 dB for graphitized PIGSO to 18 dB for graphitized PIGS4.As the tendency is similar to thatin their conductivity(Fig.6b), the increase in the SE is ascribed to their increased electrical conductivity at higher graphene content.More importantly,by comparing the SE of graphitized PIGSs and PIGFs,itis found that the SE is higher for graphitized PIGFs, even though graphitized PIGSs possess higher electrical conductivity.To gain insight into this phenomenon, their $S \mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { A } }$ and $S { \mathrm { E } } _ { \mathrm { R } }$ at $9 . 0 \mathsf { G H z }$ are analyzed in Fig.7f,where both the $S \mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { A } }$ and $S { \mathrm { E } } _ { \mathrm { R } }$ increase with the increase in graphene content. Moreover, the $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ accounts for much higher proportion than the $S { \mathrm { E } } _ { \mathrm { R } }$ does，not only for graphitized PIGFs,but also for graphitized PIGSs.For example, about $8 4 - 9 8 \%$ incident electromagnetic energy has been absorbed bythe foams,while this value for the solid counterparts is solely $8 0 { - } 8 7 \%$ .This result certainlyaffirms that the major difference among the SE of our carbon shields is the microwave absorption $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ thatis closelyrelatedto their inherent characteristics.

According to EMI shielding mechanisms,the $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ stems mainly from dielectric loss and magnetic loss [4]. Due to the nonmagnetic characteristic of our carbon shields,their $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ highly depends on the dielectric loss that involves relaxationand conduction loss,influenced bypolarizationand conductivity,respectively.Furthermore, the polarization derives from defects,interfaces and functional groups [25,26]. The high conductivity of our carbon materials contributesa lot to the conduction loss,while the residual defects in the carbon layers after graphitization,as well as the interfaces between graphene and carbon matrix,can also induce the polarization to some extent and contribute to the relaxation loss.Additionally, the structure of a shield also has a great impact on the dielectric loss [10,2O]. For EMI shielding foams,porous structure can significantly enhance the internal multiple scattering and reflections that are frequently ignored in the case of solid shields [8,69],resulting in the higher $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ and $S \mathrm { E _ { T } }$ (Fig.7f).Furthermore, some researchers believe that the porous structure can effectively reduce the impedance mismatch of shielding materials and the ambient atmosphere,leading to the enhancement in their microwaveabsorption [7,70].

Table 2 makesa comparison of the SE of various solids and foams in the X band,from which we can see clearly that carbonbased materials generally exhibited far more advantages than polymer-based ones do,in fabricatingultrathin EMI shields.In the present work,an effective SE of 24 dB was obtained by our carbon foam with the sample thickness only of $2 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ in the X band region. Moreover,multilayered carbon composites have also been fabricatedby bonding two or three layers of the PIGF4 graphitized at $2 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ together using polyurethane (PU) gel. Consequently, the SE values of our carbon foams can be dramatically improved from 24 to 51 dB by increasing the thickness of graphitized PIGF4 gradually from 24 to $7 3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (Fig. $\mathbf { 7 g } { \dot { \mathbf { \xi } } }$ ). Although both $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ and $S { \mathrm { E } } _ { \mathrm { R } }$ contribute a lot to the $S \mathrm { E _ { T } } ,$ the $S \mathrm { E _ { T } }$ increment is turned out to be dominated by the $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ as shown in Fig.7h.Considering the proportional relationship between the $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ and $S \mathrm { E _ { T } }$ [35], there is no doubt that the $S \mathrm { E _ { A } }$ contributes more to the $S \mathrm { E _ { T } }$ increment than the $S { \mathrm { E } } _ { \mathrm { R } }$ does for our multilayered carbon foams.In short, the sample thickness of the above carbon foams is generally in tens of micrometers,which is about two orders magnitude lower than that of polymer-based shields,makingit the thinnest EMI shielding foam that has ever been reported to the best of our knowledge.

# 4.5.Thermal stability

Inpractical applications,high thermal stability is generally necessary for high-performance EMI shielding materials.So the thermostability of our graphitized PIGFs was also investigated using thermogravimetric analyzer(TGA) underan oxidative(air)atmosphere.As shown in Fig.8,all the foamsare thermally stable when the temperature is up to $5 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ Moreover,the samples with graphene generally possess higher decomposition temperature.For example,the $5 \%$ weight loss temperature for graphitized PIGFO is 661 ${ } ^ { \circ } C ,$ ，while this value is dramatically improved to $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for graphitized PIGF1, $7 2 6 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for graphitized PIGF2,and eventually, $7 5 4 ^ { \circ } C$ for graphitized PIGF4. Similar phenomenon has also been declaredby Kumar et al.in the carbon foamsdecorated with CNT and ferrocene,respectively,and the interior graphitic structure is believed to be responsible for the high thermal stability of the foams[73,74].Generally, the higher the graphitization degree,the higher the thermal stability.This may be the possible reason why some of our carbon foams,whose graphitization has been accelerated by graphene,show much higher thermal stability than that without graphene does.

PIGFs via thermal decomposition and investigated their EMI shielding performance.The results revealed that graphene could simultaneously help to stabilize the porous structure of the foams and facilitate their graphitization process via the internal stress between the matrix and fillers.As a consequence,the resultant carbon foam with well-defined porous structure and high thermal stabilityexhibitedaneffectiveSE of $2 4 \mathrm { d B }$ in an ultralow thickness of $2 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .Additionally,by comparing the SEof the foamswith that of the solid counterparts,it was found that the foams possess much higher SE than the solid counterparts did.The reason was mainly due to the enhanced microwave absorption derived from the porous structure via multiple scattering and reflections.This work provides fairlyuseful information to the fabrication of ultrathin EMI shieldingmaterials for thermally harsh environment.
