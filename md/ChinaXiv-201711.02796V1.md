# B. Video monitor system

Video monitor system is composed of CCD camera,data transmission optical fiber,video data server.The CCD camera was installed on the observation window of neutralizer. The video monitor system can obtained the visible light during beam extraction.

# C. Thermocouple measurement system

The beams deposit partially as heat load on the materials in the beamline,in order to monitor the temperature,thermocouples are installed in all of heat loading components.Meanwhile,the

beam power density distribution and divergence angle can be obtained by calorimeter in which thermocouple are installed according to a certain layout (see Fig.3).11

# E. Photodiode monitor system

In order to prevent the high energy particle (due to reionization) damaging the drift duct,a set of photodiode monitor system is installed.It is composed of collimator lens,optical fiber, photodiode and logarithmic amplifier. Photodiode monitor system gather $6 5 6 ~ \mathrm { { n m } ~ \mathrm { { D a } } }$ spectral line and convert it to voltage signal, shut down NBI according to the comparing results(see Fig.5).

# F. Inferred pyrometer system

When neutral beam are injected into EAST plasma,a fraction of the beam power passes through the plasma and is deposited on the beam-target tile on the interior walls of the EAST.Inferred pyrometer system can monitor the temperature of tile and shut down NBI when the temperature of tile exceeds the setting value.Fig.6 gives the diagram of inferred pyrometer system.

Figure 7also shows the maximum temperature rise of heat load components.According to the power deposited on the calorimeter with and without the magnetic field of bending magnet, the neutralizing efficiency can be obtained.

The distribution of power density and beam divergence angle is measured using the thermocouplesinstalledin calorimeters. According to the data obtained from the thermocouple, the distribution of temperature rise can be obtained (see Fig.8). The red dotted bordered rectangle in Fig.8 corresponds to the entrance of the calorimeter.Figure 8 shows that the beam has relatively good profile.According to the data obtained from the thermocouple,the divergence angle of $\mathbf { x }$ and y direction can also be obtained. The relationship between divergence angle and perveance has been shown in Fig.9
