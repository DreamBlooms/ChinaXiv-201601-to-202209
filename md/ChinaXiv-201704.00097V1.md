$\mathrm { S n O } _ { x }$ films were fabricated by reactive rf magnetron sputtering under various oxygen partial pressures $( P _ { 0 } = 1 . 6 \% - 5 0 \%$ and then annealed in an air ambient.Four operating window regions of the $\mathrm { S n O _ { x } }$ films are demonstrated such as metallic Sn dominated films with n-type conduction,polycrystalline SnO dominated films with $\mathsf { p }$ -type conduction, $\mathbf { S n O - S n O } _ { 2 }$ composite films with high resistivity,and amorphous $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ dominated films with n-type characteristics.TFTdevices using the SnO dominated films as channels are investigated.The TFTs with the channels of a hole concentration over $1 0 ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ show depletion p-type characteristics.The hole concentration can be tunable by changing $P _ { 0 }$ ,the channel thickness,and the annealing durations.An ambipolar operating mode is obtained by modulating the hole concentration.

Transparent oxide semiconductors have been proposed as one of the most promising candidates used in thin film transistors(TFTs) orother complex electronic circuits on basis of their low-fabrication temperature,good transparency in visible light region,and high fieldeffect mobility.1-3 However, most of high mobility oxide semiconductors show n-type conduction; onlya limited number of oxides exhibit p-type conduction with modest hole mobilities.Thus,the application of oxide semiconductors is limited to unipolar n-type devices.Bipolar oxide semiconductors,in which both n-type and p-type carriers can be freely transported,are highly desirable to realize Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-like devices and circuits.4

Generally, the valence band maxima(VBM) of oxide semiconductors is mainly composed by localized O $2 p$ orbitals,which severely limits hole transport.5 The use of hybridized orbitals between O $2 p$ and metal cation nd (such as Ni 3d,Cu $3 d$ and $\mathrm { A g ~ } 4 d \Omega$ has been proposed to make p-type oxide semiconductors.6-8 P-type NiO and $\bar { \mathrm { C u } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } }$ TFTs with a field-effect mobility of $1 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { { \dot { c } m ^ { 2 } / V s } }$ and $4 . 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { V s }$ have been demonstrated, respectively.9.10 Similarly, tin monoxide $\mathrm { ( S n O ) }$ has been proved to be a good p-type oxide semiconductor due to the incorporation of isotropic extended $\mathrm { S n } ~ 5 s$ orbitals into the VBM.5.11 The $\mathsf { p }$ -type SnO TFTs with a field-effect mobility up to $6 . 7 5 \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { V s }$ has been reported.1² Interestingly, SnO has a small fundamental bandgap $( 0 . 5 { - } 0 . { \overset { } { 7 } } \ \mathrm { e V } )$ ,5,13 which favors the ambipolar behavior for electronic devices.14 Meanwhile, it has alarge direct optical bandgap $( 2 . 5 { - } 3 . 4 \mathrm { e V } )$ ,15-17 leading to rather high transparency in the visible region.In addition,it was proposed that SnO is also a good electron conductor,because the electron transport near the conduction band minimum follows a free-electron-like model.18 Therefore, among transparent oxide semiconductors,SnO TFTs were reported to operate in an ambipolar mode.4,18

The $\mathrm { { \cal S n O } }$ thin films can be prepared by several techniques,such as electron beam evaporation,pulsed laser deposition,vacuum thermal evaporation,solution process and magnetron sputtering,and so on.4,1,18-21 Among them,thesputering technique hastheadvantage of preparing large-areauniform films forlarge-scale industrial application.22 Nevertheless, the previously reported SnO TFTs exhibited either p-type or ambipolar behavior.4,18 The reason that governs the conversion from the p-type mode to the ambipolar mode was rarely reported and still not clear.In this article, $\mathrm { S n O } _ { x }$ films were fabricated by reactive rf magnetron sputtering under various oxygen partial pressure $( P _ { 0 } )$ .The structural evolution and electrical properties are also discussed in detail,in order to find out the operating window to fabricate SnO-dominated films.The influence of the fabrication conditions on the performance of the SnO TFTs is also discussed.

# Experimental

Film fabrication and characterization.- About $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ -thick $\mathrm { { S n O _ { x } } }$ films were fabricated by reactive rf magnetron sputtering applying a 2-inch Sn target $( 9 9 . 9 9 \% )$ at room temperature.The sputtering power was kept at $4 0 ~ \mathrm { W }$ Arflux $( f _ { \mathrm { A r } } )$ was fixed at 6 sccm,while $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ flux $( f _ { 0 } )$ was changed ranging from O.1 to $6 \mathrm { s c c m }$ . The oxygen partial pressure $( P _ { 0 } = f _ { 0 } / ( f _ { \mathrm { A r } } + \bar { f } _ { 0 } ) \bar { ) }$ was in a range of $1 . 6 \% - 5 0 \%$ . Subsequently, the $\mathrm { S n O _ { x } }$ films were annealed at $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in air for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ .The structural and electrical properties of the films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD,Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer) and Hall-effect (ACCENT,HL55oO) measurement, respectively.

TFT fabrication and characterization.- Top-contact and bottomgate type TFTs were fabricated on commercial available $\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { S i } ( \mathrm { n } ^ { + } )$ （204号 $( \mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } { \sim } 1 0 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ,the gate capacitance per unit area $C _ { 0 } \sim 3 3 ~ \mathrm { n F / c m ^ { 2 } }$ ） substrates.The channellayers witha thickness of about $2 4 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ were sputtered with $P _ { 0 }$ as the parameter varying between $1 0 . 4 \%$ and $1 5 . 5 \%$ ： Subsequently,Ni/Au source-drain electrodes were deposited by Ebeam evaporation.The $\mathrm { S n O }$ channel layer and source-drain electrodes were patterned by shadow masks.The width and length of the TFTs were $1 0 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ,respectively. Before depositing sourcedrain electrodes, $\mathrm { S n O }$ films were annealed in air at various temperatures ( $1 5 0 { - } 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with different annealing durations $( t _ { \mathrm { A } } )$ . Output and transfer characteristics of the TFTs were measured at room temperature in the dark using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200).

# Results and Discussion

Thin film properties.-Fig.1 shows the XRD patterns of the $\mathrm { S n O } _ { x }$ films fabricated at various $P _ { 0 }$ . At $P _ { \mathrm { O } } = 1 . 6 \%$ ,both $\scriptstyle { \alpha - S { \mathrm { n O } } }$ phase ( $a -$ $\mathrm { P b O }$ structure, $\mathrm { P 4 / n m m }$ , JCPDS card No.06-0395)and $\beta { \cdot } S \mathrm { n }$ phase $\mathrm { ( I 4 _ { 1 } / a m d }$ ，JCPDS card No.19-1365)are observed in the films,but the latter one is dominated.As $P _ { 0 }$ increases,the peak intensity of the $\beta$ -Snphase decreases and becomes comparable with that of the $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { a - S n O } }$ phase at $P _ { \mathrm { O } } = 9 . 1 \%$ .At $P _ { 0 } = 1 5 . 5 \%$ and $1 6 . 7 \%$ ，the $\beta { \cdot } S \mathrm { n }$ phase nearlydisappearsandonlythe $\scriptstyle { \alpha - S _ { \mathrm { n O } } }$ phase with more attenuated peak intensityis observed.When $P _ { 0 } \ge 1 7 . 8 \%$ ,no characteristic peaks are detected, suggesting the amorphous nature of the films.The phase evolution trend is consistent with our previous report.23 It was suggested that the crystalline structure transition from polycrystalline to amorphous results from the involvement of $\mathrm { S n ^ { 4 + } }$ in the SnO matrix, which boosts the structural disorder and consequently increases the crystallization temperature.23

Fig.2 shows the dependency of Hall mobility and carrier concentration on different $P _ { 0 }$ .In conjunction with the crystalline phase evolution,it can be roughly divided into four $P _ { 0 }$ regions to describe the electrical evolution of the films.(1) $P _ { 0 } \leq 9 . 1 \%$ ,in which the films present $n$ -type conduction dominated by the metallic Sn phase.The films exhibit a very low resistivity (around $1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \Omega \cdot \mathrm { c m } )$ andahigh electron concentration $( 1 0 ^ { 2 2 } { - } 1 0 ^ { \dot { 2 } 3 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } )$ .The resistivity of the films is abnormallyhighat $P _ { 0 } \leq 4 . 8 \%$ because the filmis discontinuous (some cracks can be observed even by the naked eyes),most probably due to the different thermal expansion coefficients between metallic Sn and SnO.(2) $9 . 1 \% < P _ { 0 } < 1 7 . 8 \%$ ,in which the films present $p$ -type conduction dominated by the polycrystalline $\mathrm { { \cal S n O } }$ phase.In this region, the hole mobility shows an increasing trend $( 0 . { \bar { 2 } } 6 { - } 1 . 6 7 \ \mathrm { c m ^ { 2 } / V s } )$ and the hole concentration decreases from $1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ to $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ as $P _ { 0 }$ increases.(3) $1 7 . 8 \% \leq P _ { 0 } < 2 5 \%$ ,where the films exhibit a rather high resistivity $\left( > 1 0 ^ { 4 } \ \Omega \cdot \mathrm { c m } \right)$ and pass a transition from polycrystalline to amorphous. (4) $P _ { 0 } \ge 2 5 \%$ ,in which the films display $n$ -type behavior.In this region,the amorphous $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ phase is considered to dominate other phases.23 The conversion from p-type conduction to high resistivity and then to n-type conduction with $P _ { 0 }$ is believed to mainly originate from the competition between the donor and acceptor generation process.23 Specifically, for the SnO-dominated films, the majority carriers are holes originated from acceptors.As the $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ content increases with $P _ { 0 }$ ,the acceptors are gradually compensated by the donors in the $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ .When the number of the acceptors has approximately the same order of magnitude as the donors, the $\mathbf { S n O } _ { x }$ films would exhibit the maximum resistivity,as named as“conductivity dilemmaarea",whichis observed for the films at $P _ { 0 }$ between $1 7 . 8 \%$ and $2 5 \%$ . The $n$ -type behavior would be present if the donor effect is overwhelming,and vice versa.

$1 5 . 5 \%$ . The TFT at $P _ { 0 } = 1 0 . 4 \%$ displays a depletion p-type characteristic.This device cannot be turned off completely even though the gate-source voltage $( V _ { \mathrm { G S } } )$ increases to $6 0 ~ \mathrm { V } ,$ because the carrier concentration of the channel layer $( \sim 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } ) \$ ）is too high to be depleted. As $P _ { 0 }$ increases to $1 1 . 8 \%$ or $1 3 . 0 \%$ ,the TFTs showaweak ambipolar characteristic.As $P _ { 0 }$ increases to $1 4 . 3 \%$ ,the drain-source current $( I _ { \mathrm { D S } } )$ sharply decreases to $\sim 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 }$ A and the device presents no TFT switching behavior,owing to the high-resistivity of the channel layer with $\mathrm { S n O - S n O } _ { 2 }$ composite phase.As $P _ { 0 }$ increases to $1 5 . 5 \%$ the TFT displays an n-type characteristic due to the $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ dominated channel.

The operation mode conversion of the TFTs follows a similar variation trend with the electrical evolution of the $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ -thick $\mathrm { S n O _ { x } }$ films (Fig.3),but withlower $P _ { 0 }$ at which different operating modes begins to change.It is considered that a $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ layer of a few nanometers is formed at the surface of the $\mathrm { { S n O } _ { \mathrm { { x } } } }$ films during the air-annealing process.With the same annealing duration,the thickness of the $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ layer is almost a constant value for the $\mathrm { { S n O } _ { \mathrm { { x } } } }$ films with different thickness. Thus,the thinner $\mathrm { { S n O _ { x } } }$ films have a higher relative content of $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ which can generate a compensation for the holes,and consequently show a lower hole concentration.According to the Hall results,the hole concentration of the $2 4 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ -thick film $\mathsf { \bar { \rho } } _ { \mathrm { \sim } 1 0 ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { \ c m } ^ { - 3 } } ,$ decreases by one order compared to the $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ -thick one $( \sim 1 0 ^ { 1 9 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } ) \$ .Also, the TFT with a $3 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ -thick channel layer shows a very low on/off current ratio（129) due to the relatively higher conductive channel, while the TFTwith a $1 4 \mathrm { n m }$ -thick channellayer demonstratesno TFT switching behavior on account of the high resistivity of the channel (as seen in Fig.4).

It's necessary to further investigate the ambipolar TFTs.The on/off current ratio $( I _ { o n } / I _ { o f f } )$ and the linear field-effect mobility $( \mu _ { \mathrm { l i n } } )$ in the $p$ -channel operation are 1O7O and $1 . 4 5 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { V s }$ for the TFT at $P _ { 0 }$ $= 1 1 . 8 \%$ ，and 1340 and $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { V s }$ for the TFT at $P _ { 0 } = 1 3 . 0 \%$ respectively.The turn-onvoltage $\cdot V _ { \mathrm { o n } }$ ,defined as the gate voltage at the minimum $\lvert I _ { \mathrm { D S } } \rvert$ in a transfer curve),reflecting the symmetry of an ambipolar TFT,is expected to be close to zero for the ambipolar TFT with good symmetry. The $V _ { o n }$ is $5 7 . 8 \mathrm { V }$ and $5 8 . 8 \mathrm { V }$ for the TFTs at $P _ { 0 }$ $= 1 1 . 8 \%$ and $1 3 . 0 \%$ ,respectively.To sumup the electrical parameters, the TFT at $P _ { 0 } = 1 1 . 8 \%$ shows a relatively acceptable performance. Therefore,the channel layer deposited at $P _ { 0 } = 1 1 . 8 \%$ is selected to carry out further discussion.

Figure 5.Transfercharacteristics of TFTs annealed atdifferent temperatures.

Fig.5 depicts the transfer curves of TFT devices annealed at different temperatures.The TFT annealed at $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ shows the best performance (especially a large $I _ { o n } / I _ { o f f }$ value) as listed above.At $1 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ the $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ at various $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ almost keeps at $- 2 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \mathrm { ~ A ~ }$ ,indicating that the current in the channel layer cannot be tuned by gate voltages. The most possibly reason is that the channel layer has a high resistivity and a non-ohmic contact with the source-drain electrodes.At $2 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the device shows a weak ambipolar signal.As the annealing temperature increases to $3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the TFT changes into a weak n-type mode due to the $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ -dominated channel.

Fig.6a displays transfer characteristics of the TFT devices annealed at $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in air with different durations $( t _ { \mathrm { A } } )$ .With increasing $t _ { \mathrm { A } }$ ,the on current decreases,while the off current first decreases and then rebounds when $t _ { \mathrm { A } } > 2 \mathrm { h }$ ,which results ina maximum $I _ { \mathrm { o n } } / I _ { \mathrm { o f f } }$ of 1550 at $t _ { \mathrm { A } } = 2 \ : \mathrm { h }$ ,as shown in Fig. 6b.It should be noted that the $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ at $V _ { \mathrm { G S } } > 2 0 ~ \mathrm { V }$ decreasesvery slowlywhen $t _ { \mathrm { A } } > 4 \mathrm { h }$ ,indicating that the channel layer is more and more difficult to be depleted by increasing $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ .Ogo et al.had observed a similar phenomenon in SnO TFTs, and they speculated that the possible origin lies in that there are too many trap states sited at deep energies $( > \sim 0 . 2 \ : \mathrm { e V }$ above the valence band) to raise the Fermi level by applying larger positive $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ .24 When $t _ { \mathrm { A } } ~ > ~ 2 ~ \mathrm { h }$ ，the deep-level trap states seem to increase as $t _ { \mathrm { A } }$ ，resulting in larger off currents and threshold voltages.As shown in Fig. 6b,the $V _ { \mathrm { t h } }$ decreases first and then increases with increasing annealing duration,approaching a minimum value at $t _ { \mathrm { A } } = 4 \ : \mathrm { h }$ . Halleffect measurements were also carried out,as shown in Fig.6c. The hole concentration illustrates a decrease trend,which can couple with the decrease of the on current and the $V _ { \mathrm { t h } }$ . TheHall mobility increases with increasing $t _ { \mathrm { A } }$ , opposite to the field-effect mobility evolution. As shown in Fig.6b,the field-effect mobilities in the linear and saturation regions( $\mathrm { \bar { \mu } l i n }$ and $\mu _ { \mathrm { s a t } }$ ）monotonously decrease with $t _ { \mathrm { A } }$ . In other words,long-time annealing is good for improving the hole mobility of the film,but is not desirable to improve the field-effect mobility of devices.The $\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ dielectric/channel interface becomes deteriorated due to a long-time annealing,leading to a more intense interface scattering.Thus,the carrier transport in the channel is greatly suppressed and consequently the field-effect hole mobility is decreased.

The TFT deposited at $P _ { 0 } = 1 1 . 8 \%$ and then annealed at $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ shows a relatively optimal performance, $\textit { i . e . }$ ,a $I _ { \mathrm { o n } } / I _ { \mathrm { o f f } }$ of 1550, a $\mu _ { \mathrm { l i n } }$ of $1 . 3 6 \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { V s }$ ,a $\mu _ { \mathrm { s a t } }$ of $0 . { \dot { 6 } } 7 ~ { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { 2 } / { \mathrm { V s } }$ in the $\mathfrak { p }$ -channel operation, a $I _ { \mathrm { o n } } / I _ { \mathrm { o f f } }$ of ${ \sim } 3$ in the $\mathfrak { n }$ -channel operation,and a $V _ { \mathrm { o n } }$ of ${ 5 7 } \ \mathrm { V } .$ The output curves of the TFT are shown in Fig. 6d. In the negative $ { V _ { \mathrm { D S } } }$ region (the left panel),the absolute $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ increases as the positive $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ decreases and negative $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ increases,showing a typical accumulation $\mathsf { p }$ -channel mode.In the positive $ { V _ { \mathrm { D S } } }$ region (the right panel), the $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ at small $ { V _ { \mathrm { D S } } }$ increases as the positive $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ increases,anda superlinear (diode-like) current signature presents at higher $ { V _ { \mathrm { D S } } }$ due to injection of the holes, showing an inversion $\mathfrak { n }$ -channel mode.

# Conclusions

$\mathrm { S n O } _ { x }$ films were produced by reactive rf magnetron sputtering under various oxygen partial pressures $( P _ { 0 } )$ in conjunction with $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \dot { \mathrm { C } }$ air-annealing afterwards.The structural and electrical evolution of the $\mathrm { S n O } _ { x }$ films has four stages: metallic Sn dominated films with n-type conduction at $P 0 \leq 9 . 1 \%$ ,polycrystalline $\mathrm { { \cal S n O } }$ dominated films with p-type conduction when $9 . 1 \% < P _ { 0 } < 1 7 . 8 \%$ $\mathbf { S n O - S n O } _ { 2 }$ composite films with high resistivity when $1 7 . 8 \% \leq P _ { 0 } < 2 5 \%$ ,and amorphous $\mathrm { S n O } _ { 2 }$ dominated films with $n$ -type characteristicsat $P _ { 0 } \ge 2 5 \%$ ：

TFTs with the SnO-dominated channel are investigated. The optimal channel thickness and annealing temperature are found to be around $2 4 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,respectively.As $P _ { 0 }$ increases,the TFTs experience an interesting conversion from $\mathsf { p }$ -channel to plausible ambipolar working mode,mainly determined by the hole concentration. As the annealing time increases from $0 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ to $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ ,the threshold voltage shifts to the negative position due to the decrease of the hole concentration,and the field-effect mobility slightly decreases,probably due to the enhanced interface scattering at the dielectrics/channel interface.
