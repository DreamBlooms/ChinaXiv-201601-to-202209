In split supersymmetry, gauginos and Higgsinos are the only supersymmetric particles which are possibly accessble at foreseeable colliders.While the direct experimental searches,such as LEP and Tevatron experiments,gave robust lower bounds on the masses of these particles,the cosmic dark matter can give some upper bounds and thus have important implications for the searches at future colliders.In this work we scrutinize such dark matter constraints and show the allowed mass range for charginos and neutralinos (the mass eigenstates of gauginos and Higgsinos).We find that the lightest chargino must be lighter than about 1 TeV under the popular assumption $M _ { 1 } = M _ { 2 } / 2$ and about 2 or 3 TeV in other cases.The corresponding production rates of the lightest chargino at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)and the International Linear Colldier (ILC) are also shown. While in some parts of the allowed region the chargino pair production rate can be larger than 1 pb at LHC and 100 fb at the ILC,other parts of the region correspond to very small production rates and thus there is no guarantee to find the charginos of split supersymmetry at future colliders.

# I.INTRODUCTION

Given the importance of supersymmetry in both particle physics and string theory,searching for supersymmetry seems tobe acrucial task in the ongoing and forthcoming colliers.The forthcoming LHC collder would be able to explorethe supersymmetric particles up to afew TeVandthe ILCcollier would allow precision test ofsupersymmetry. Of course,there is no guarantee to fnd supersymmetry at these colders since the masses of the supersymmetric particlesare basically unknown.As is wellknown,in order to solve the fine-tuning problem inparticle theory,the supersymmetric particlesshould be below TeV scale and thus the LHC would beafactory ofsupersymmetric particles. However,in the recently proposed split supersymmetry [1],the supersymmetric solution of fine-tuning problem in particle physics is givenup (inspired by the need of fine-tuning for the cosmological constant)，while the virtues of supersymmetry in preserving grand unification as wellas providing the cosmic dark matter candidate are stil retained.Asaresult,the mass scaleof allsfermions as wellas the several heavy Higgsbosonscanbevery high while the gaugino/Higgsino masscale may be stillbelow the TeV scale.While the split supersymmetry has the obvious virtue of naturally avoiding the notorious supersymmetric favor problem,it predicts that no supersymmetric scalar particles except a light Higgs boson are accessble at theforeseeable particle colliders.Thus,if split supersymmetry is thetrue story1,the only waytoreveal supersymmetryat thecoliders is through gauginoor Higgsino productions. Among the gauginos and Higgsinos,the gluino is theonly colored particle and thus may be most copiously produced in the gluon-rich environment of the LHC.However,the gluino is usually speculated to be much heavier than other gauginosand Higsinos. It wasshown[3] that the grand unification requirement canalow a gluino as heavy as18 TeV. Furthermore,if thedark matter isassumed tobe the gravitino produced fromthe latedecayof the meta-stable gluino which freezedoutat the earlyuniverse,it was found [4]that the gluino must be heavier thanabout 14TeVand thus impossibly accessble at the LHC.So,to explore split supersymmetry we should not focus onlyon gluino productions; the productions of the electroweakly interacting gauginos and Higgsinos (which mix into two charged particles calld charginos and four neutral particles called neutralinos)should also beconsidered although their production rates at the LHC are much lower. Of course,if the LHC can discover supersymmetry and then the ILC takes the task of precision test,the productions of charginos and neutralinos at the ILC willplay the dominant role.For both the

LHC and the ILC,the production of charginos willgive good signatures since the subsequent decays yield energetic leptons.To facilitate thecolider searches forthecharginosandneutralinos,the pre-estimationof theiralowed ma regions are important.

While the direct experimental searches,such as LEP and Tevatron experiments,gave robust lower bounds for the masses of charginos and neutralinos,the cosmic dark matter can give some upper bounds and thus have important implications for the searches at future coliders.Therefore,although the consequence of split supersymmetry in the dark mater isse hasbeen considered tosome extent intheliterature[3-6],we inthis workscrutinize thedark mater constraints on the masses of charginos and neutralinos and evaluate the corresponding production rates at the LHC and ILC.

This work is organized in the folows. In Sec.II we recapitulate the parameter space of the sector of charginos and neutralinos.In Sec.II weexamine thedark matter constraints.We willshow the constraintson (a)the original parameter space, (b)the masses of charginos and neutralinos,and (c) the production rates at the LHCand the ILC. The conclusions are given in Sec. IV.

Note that for the supersymmetry parameters we adopt the notation in Ref. [7]. We work in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM)and assume thelightest supersymmetric particle is the lightest neutralino, which solely makes up the cosmic dark matter.Also,we fix the parameter $\tan \beta = 4 0$ since a large value of $\tan \beta$ is favored by current experiments and, in the region of large $\tan \beta ( \gtrsim 1 0 )$ , our results are not sensitive to $\tan \beta$ ：

# II.PARAMETERSPACEOFCHARGINOSANDNEUTRALINOS

The chargino mass matrix is given by

$$
\left( \begin{array} { c c } { { M _ { 2 } } } & { { \sqrt { 2 } m _ { W } \sin \beta } } \\ { { \sqrt { 2 } m _ { W } \cos \beta } } & { { \mu } } \end{array} \right) ,
$$

and the neutralino mass matrix is given by

$$
\left( \begin{array} { c c c c } { { M _ { 1 } } } & { { 0 } } & { { - m _ { Z } \sin \theta _ { W } \cos \beta } } & { { m _ { Z } \sin \theta _ { W } \sin \beta } } \\ { { 0 } } & { { M _ { 2 } } } & { { m _ { Z } \cos \theta _ { W } \cos \beta } } & { { - m _ { Z } \cos \theta _ { W } \sin \beta } } \\ { { - m _ { Z } \sin \theta _ { W } \cos \beta } } & { { m _ { Z } \cos \theta _ { W } \cos \beta } } & { { 0 } } & { { - \mu } } \\ { { m _ { Z } \sin \theta _ { W } \sin \beta } } & { { - m _ { Z } \cos \theta _ { W } \sin \beta } } & { { - \mu } } & { { 0 } } \end{array} \right) ,
$$

where $M _ { 1 }$ and $M _ { 2 }$ are respectively the $U ( 1 )$ and $S U ( 2 )$ gaugino mass parameters, $\mu$ is the mass parameter in the mixing term $- \mu \epsilon _ { i j } H _ { 1 } ^ { i } H _ { 2 } ^ { j }$ in the superpotential, and $\tan \beta \equiv v _ { 2 } / v _ { 1 }$ is ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. The diagonalization of (2.1) gives two charginos $\chi _ { 1 , 2 } ^ { + }$ with the convention $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { + } } < M _ { \chi _ { 2 } ^ { + } }$ ; while the diagonalization of (2.2) gives four neutralinos $\chi _ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } ^ { 0 }$ with the convention $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } } < M _ { \chi _ { 2 } ^ { 0 } } < M _ { \chi _ { 3 } ^ { 0 } } < M _ { \chi _ { 4 } ^ { 0 } }$ So the masses and mixings of charginos and neutralinos are determined by four parameters: $M _ { 1 }$ ， $M _ { 2 }$ ， $\mu$ and $\tan \beta$ ：

The current constraints [8]on these parameters are divided into two classs: (1)direct constraints from experimental searches of supersymmetric particles; (2) indirect constraints from some precisely measured low-energy proceses or physical quantities viasupersymmetric quantum effcts.For split supersymmetry,almostallindirect constraints from low-energy processes, such as various $B$ -decays,drop out since the supersymmetric loop effects in these processes usualy involve sfermions which are superheavy in split supersymmetry.The most stringent direct bounds are from LEP experiments [9]: (i) the lighter chargino $\chi _ { 1 } ^ { + }$ must be heavier than about lO3 GeV; (ii) the LSP must be heavier than about 47 GeV; (ii) the value of $\tan \beta$ must be larger than 2.

Note that in addition to the direct lower bound from LEP II, theoretically a large tan $\beta$ helps to push up the lightest Higgs boson mass and thus ameliorate the stress between the experimental lower bound and the theoretical uppel bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass ². So in our analyses we assume a large $\tan \beta$ and fix it to be 40. We checkec that in the region of large $\tan \beta ( \gtrsim 1 0 )$ , our results are not sensitive to tan $\beta$

We assume the cosmic dark matter is solelycomposed of theLSP,which is assumed to be the lightest neutralino $\chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ . (If the gravitino is assumed to be the LSP and makeup the dark matter,it willincur some severe cosmoligical constraints [11].)

The thermal relic densityof the lightest neutralino from the freeze-out can be calculated from the Boltzmann equation which involves the thermal averaged cross section of neutralino annihilations.Inour work we use the package DarkSUSY [12] and we checked that the package micrOMEGAs [13] gives the similar results in our study. In calculating the crosssection of neutralino annihilations,many additional supersymmetric parameters are involved, among which the most important ones are sfermion masses and $M _ { A }$ (the mass of CP-odd Higgs boson). Since we focus only on split supersymmetry, all sfermion masses and $M _ { A }$ are superheavy. So any diagrams involving a sfermion or a heavy Higgsboson makes negligible contributions to neutralino anihilations.Actually,we found that as long as the sfermion mass or $M _ { A }$ gets heavier than about $1 0 ~ \mathrm { T e V }$ , the effects of sfermions or heavy Higgs bosons decouple, as shown in Figs.1 and 2. The peak in Fig.1(b) happens around the $A$ -funnel’ resonance point $M _ { A } \approx 2 M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } }$ ：

# III.WMAPDARKMATTERCONSTRAINTS

The $2 \sigma$ allowed region for the dark matter relic density is

$$
0 . 0 9 4 < \Omega _ { C D M } h ^ { 2 } < 0 . 1 2 9 ,
$$

which can be inferred from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) measurements [14]. In the following we present the $2 \sigma$ allowed regions for four cases: (1) $M _ { 1 } = M _ { 2 } / 2$ ； (2) $\mu$ is superheavy; (3) $M _ { 2 }$ is superheavy; and (4) （204号 $M _ { 1 }$ is superheavy.Inour calculations we fixa'superheavy'massto be1O0 TeV sinceit is high enough forthe relevant supersymmetric particles to decouple from the neutralino annihilations.In each case we present the alowed region for(a) the original parameter space;(b) the chargino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { + } }$ versus the neutralino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } }$ ; (c) the cross section of chargino pair production at LHC and ILC versus the chargino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { + } }$ . Note that we just give the tree-level cross sections anddo not include theone-loop corrections [15].Thecenter-of-massenergy is 14 TeVfor LHCand is assumed tobe1TeVfor ILC[16].Theresults are resented in Figs.2-5,where the dot-dashed lineis the LEP II lower limit on chargino mass.

(1） $M _ { 1 } = M _ { 2 } / 2$ : This case is well motivated since the supergravity models predict the unification relation $M _ { 1 } =$ $\textstyle { \frac { 5 } { 3 } } M _ { 2 } \tan ^ { 2 } \theta _ { W } \simeq 0 . 5 M _ { 2 }$ ．In the low mass region for both $M _ { 2 }$ and $\mu$ in Fig. 2(a),the dark matter is the mixing of gauginos and Higgsinos. The strip with very large $M _ { 2 }$ corresponds to Higgsino dark matter,while the strip with very large $\mu$ corresponds to gaugino dark matter (the mixing of bino and wino). From Fig. 2(b) we see that both the chargino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { + } }$ and the neutralino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } }$ is upper bounded by about 1 TeV.Fig. 2(c) shows that in the allowed region the cross section of chargino pair production at LHC can reach a few pb for alight chargino,but dropsrapidlyas thechargino gets heavy.Thecross sectionat ILCcanreach10Ofbforalight chargino in the allowed region.

(2) Superheavy $\mu$ : This case was proposed and favored by some authors [17] because the $\mu$ problem [18] is avoided and a crude gauge coupling unification is preserved. In the low mass region for both $M _ { 2 }$ and $M _ { 1 }$ in Fig.3(a), the dark matter is the mixing of bino and wino; while the region with large $M _ { 1 }$ corresponds to wino dark matter. Fig. 3(b) shows that both the chargino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { + } }$ and the neutralino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } }$ is upper bounded by about 3 TeV. Fig. 3(c)shows that in the alowed region the cross section of chargino pair production at LHC can reach 10pb for alight chargino,but drops rapidlyas thechargino gets heavy.The crosssectionat ILCcanreach 2Oofb fora light chargino in the allowed region.

FIG. 3. The WMAP $2 \sigma$ allowed region (shaded area) in case of superheavy $\mu$ . The light shaded region (yellow) is not allowed oyLEP experiment.

(3) Superheavy $M _ { 2 }$ : In the low mass region for both $M _ { 1 }$ and $\mu$ in Fig. 4(a), the dark matter is the mixing of bino and Higgsinos. When $M _ { 1 }$ ( $\mu$ ）gets very large, a strip is remained, which corresponds to Higgsino (bino) dark matter.

The chargino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { + } }$ is upper bounded by about 3 TeV and the neutralino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } }$ is upper bounded by about 1 TeV.Fora light chargino in the allowed region,thecrossectionof chargino pair production canreach the level of pb at LHC and 10O fb at ILC.

(4） Superheavy $M _ { 1 }$ : In Fig. 5(a) the strip with large $M _ { 2 }$ ( $\mu$ ） corresponds to Higgsino (wino） dark matter. As shown in Fig. 5(b), both the chargino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { + } }$ and the neutralino mass $M _ { \chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } }$ are lower bounded by about 1 TeV and upper bounded by about 2.5 TeV.Thus the charginos cannot be pair produced at the ILC with c.m. energy of 1 TeV.Although thecharginos can be pair produced at the LHC,thecrossection is very small,as shown in Fig.5(c).

Note that while the chargino pair production with a rate of10O fb at ILC may not be hard to observe due to the clean enviroment of the ILC（chargino pair production is regarded as a good wayto test split supersymmetry at ILC [19]),earching for the chargino pair production with a cross section of pb level at the LHC maybequitechallanging. The chargino $\chi _ { 1 } ^ { + }$ decays into a neutralino $\chi _ { 1 } ^ { 0 }$ and a pair of fermions (two jets or a charged lepton plus a neutrino). So the signatureofcharginopair production is (i) two energetic leptons plus missing energy,or(ii)oneenergetic lepton plus two jets plus missing energy. Let us take the latter signature, i.e., $\ell + 2 j + P _ { T } ^ { \mathrm { m i s s } }$ ， as an example. The huge background comes from $W j j$ . In order to substantially reduce this background, we may apply a cut on the transverse mass defined by

$$
m _ { T } = \sqrt { ( P _ { T } ^ { \ell } + P _ { T } ^ { \mathrm { m i s s } } ) ^ { 2 } - ( \vec { P } _ { T } ^ { \ell } + \vec { P } _ { T } ^ { \mathrm { m i s s } } ) ^ { 2 } } .
$$

$m _ { T }$ is always less than $M _ { W }$ (and peaks just below $M _ { W }$ ） if the only missing energy comes from a neutrino from $W$ （20 decay,which is the case for the $W j j$ background events. For the signal, $m _ { T }$ is spread about equally above and below $M _ { W }$ ,due to the large extra missing energy from the neutralinos. Therefore,we may, for example,require $m _ { T } > 9 0$ GeV. Given the importance of chargino pair production as a test of split supersymmetry at the LHC,detailed Monte Carlo studies with the consideration of various backgrounds are needed,which is beyond the scope of this work.

# IV.CONCLUSION

In split supersymmetry,gauginos and Higgsinos are the only supersymetric particles which are posibly accessible at the LHCor the ILC colider.The masss of these particles are subject to the stringent constraints from the cosmic dark matter.Under the assumption that the lightst neutralino is the LSPand constitutethe dark matter in the universe,we scrutinized the dark mater constraints on the masss of charginos and neutralinos.We considered several cases: (1) $M _ { 1 } = M _ { 2 } / 2$ ； (2) $\mu$ is superheavy; (3) $M _ { 2 }$ is superheavy; and (4) $M _ { 1 }$ is superheavy. We found that the lightest chargino $\chi _ { 1 } ^ { + }$ must be lighter than about 1 TeV in the first case and about 2 or 3 TeV in other cases.In the first three cases,the corresponding productionrateof the chargino pair at the LHC (ILC)canreach the level of pb (100 fb)in some parts of the alowed region and thus hopefully observable.But in the last case,the chargino must be heavierthan about1TeVand thus hasatoosmallproductionrate tobeobservaleat the LHC.So,overal,there is no guarantee to find the charginos of split supersymmetry at the LHC or ILC collider.
