ABSTRACT: The control and detection over processing， transport and delivery of chemical species is of great importance in sensors and biological systems. The transient characteristics of the migration of chemical species reflect the basic properties in the processings of chemical species. Here, we observed the field-configurable proton effects in a laterally coupled transistor gated by phosphorosilicate glass (PSG). The bias on the lateral gate would modulate the interplay between protons and electrons at the PSG/indiumzinc-oxide (IZO) channel interface. Due to the modulation of protons flux within the PSG films， the IZO channel current would be modified correspondingly. The characteristic time for the proton gating is estimated to be on the order of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m } s$ .Such laterally coupled oxide based transistors with proton gating are promising for low-cost portable biosensors and neuromorphic system applications.

# 1.INTRODUCTION

In ion transistors,ions and charged molecules act as the charge carriers.1-3Due to the fact that such carrerscarry specific chemical information and functionality， they can selectively regulate various functions and processes.Thus,ion transistor based circuits can be useful in delivering， regulating and establishing signaling patterns of ions and biomolecules.4 Furthermore,ions,molecules or charged molecules could also be selectively transferred with the specific modified nanopores/ nanochannels used in ion transistors.' In these nanofluids systems,the ionic/electronic coupling occurs in a way that the gate could control and monitor the ionic currents.6 The ion migration could also be utilized to modulate the carrier transport characteristics of condensed materials greatly.In ionic liquid or ionic gel electrolyte gated transistors，the movements of anions/cations in the electrolyte toward the positively/negativelycharged electrode forman electric-doublelayer (EDL),composed of a compact Helmholtz layer and a diffuse layer.As a result of the charge separation within a few angstroms,a high EDL capacitance above $1 ~ \mu \mathrm { F } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ could be obtained.9-Therefore,field-induced electronic phase transitions and superconductivity are observed for specific condensed materials with transistor configuration.8,12,13 In these devices，the gate bias triggers the migrations of ions within electrolyte，inducing the changes in carrier transport characteristics of condensed materials as a result.14

Recently，wide band-gap oxide semiconductors have been reported to be gated by solid state electrolytes，such as nanogranular SiO2,15-18 nanogranularAlO3,19WO20,21 chitosaneoro electrolytes have been discussed, the transient characteristics for proton gating still needed to be discussed in terms of characteristic time.On the otherhand,the biological activities are always,performed with ion signals，rather than the electronsreoeitgsibte ionic signals into easily detectable electron signals.Thus,the realization of ionic/electronic coupled devices is meaningful for the interfacing between electrical signals and biological response in the biological systems.In this work,we observed the field-configurable proton effects in a laterally coupled transistor configuration.Due to the modulation of protons flux within the nanogranular phosphorosilicate glass (PSG） films, indium-zinc-oxide (IZO) channel current would be modified correspondingly. The transient characteristics of the proton gating were discussed, resulting in the extraction of characteristic time for proton gating. The laterally coupled oxide based transistors with proton gating are promising for low-cost portable biosensors and neuromorphic system applications.

# 2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

Laterally coupled IZO transistors were fabricated on glass substratesat room temperature，as schematically shown in Figure 1．First, nanogranular phosphorosilicate glass (PSG） films were deposited on glass substrate and Si wafer at room temperature by plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition （PECVD）using $\mathrm { { S i H } _ { 4 } }$ 0 $9 4 \% \mathrm { \ S i H } _ { 4 } \ + \ 6 \%$ $\mathrm { P H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { , }$ ）and $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ as reactive gases.For characterizing the proton conductivities，the PSG flm was also deposited on ITO glass substrate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM） characterizations indicate the spongy microstructures for the as-deposited PSG films,as shown in the left panel of Figure 1.Next, patterned $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ thick IZO films were deposited on the PSG films coated glass substrate by radiofrequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with a nickel shadow mask. The sputtering was performed using an IZO ceramic target with a RF power of 1oo W and aworkingpressure of $0 . 5 \mathrm { P a }$ 、The size of the IZO patterns is $1 0 0 0 \times 1 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ .Theright panel ofFigure1illustrates the top-view image of the IZO patterns by an optical microscope (Olympus DX51).A thin IZO layer will be self-assembled between two IZO patterns with a distance of $8 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m } , ^ { 2 7 }$ while no IZO layer will be self-assembled between two IZO patterns with a distance of 300 $\mu \mathrm { m } ,$ as schematically shown in Figure 1.When the isolated IZO pattern is deemed as the gate and the IZO patterns with self-assembled thin IZO layer are deemed as the source and drain electrodes，a laterally coupled IZO transistor is obtained.The thin IZO layer is deemed as the channel.The channel width $( W )$ and length $\mathit { \Omega } ( L )$ were 1000 and $8 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m } ,$ respectively.The isolated IZO patterns were also deposited on PSG flm coated ITO conductive glass substrate to obtain an IZO/PSG/ITO capacitor. Electric characteristics were performed in a probe station in air ambient with a relative humidity of ${ \sim } 6 0 \%$ .Samples were kept ina dark box to prevent interference from the visible light. Proton conductivities and frequency dependent capacitances of the PSG films were characterized by a Solartron 1260A impedance analyzer with an AC amplitude of $0 . 1 \mathrm { V }$ and DC amplitude ranged between $- 0 . 5$ and $+ 1 . 0 \mathrm { ~ V } .$ Electrical performances of the laterally coupled IZO transistor were characterized by using Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer at room temperature.

# 3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Proton conductivities $( \delta )$ of the nanogranular PSG flms were measured with an IZO/PSG/ITO capacitor,as shown in the insetofFigure 2a.Atypical Cole-Cole plot is shown in Figure 2a with a DC bias of $0 \mathrm { V } .$ .The impedance spectroscopy dada are collected as real $\left( \mathrm { R e } Z ^ { \prime } \right)$ and imaginary $\left( \operatorname { I m } Z ^ { \prime \prime } \right)$ components of the complex impedance.The impedance real value $( R )$ where the impedance imaginary value is zero is used to obtain the $\delta$ value by using the following relation:

$$
\delta = \frac { D } { ( R - R _ { 0 } ) A }
$$

where $D , A$ and $R _ { 0 }$ are the thickness of the PSG film，the electrode surface area and the resistance of electrode, respectively. The thickness $D$ is $\sim 1 2 8 0 \ \mathrm { n m } , A$ is ${ \sim } 1 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ $\mathrm { c m } ^ { \frac { \bullet } { 2 } }$ while $R _ { 0 }$ is ${ \sim } 2 0 \Omega$ Thus, $\delta$ is estimated to be ${ \sim } 9 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ $S / \mathrm { c m }$ when DC bias is $0 \mathrm { V } .$ ，The bias dependent $\delta$ values have also been studied,as shown in Figure 2b.It is observed that the $\delta$ values increase slightly from ${ \sim } 9 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ to ${ \sim } 9 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { \ S / }$ cm with the DC bias increasing from $- 0 . 5$ to $+ 1 . 0$ V. Frequency dependent specific capacitances of the PSG films were measured with an in-plane sandwich structure,as shown in the inset of Figure 2c. Figure 2c illustrates a typical frequency dependent specific capacitance measured with a DC bias of 0.5 V. The frequency is ranged from $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { H z }$ to $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { M H z } .$ It is observed that the capacitance increases gradually with the decreased frequency. A maximum specific capacitance $\left( C _ { 0 } \right)$ of ${ \sim } 2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { F / c m } ^ { 2 }$ is obtained at ${ 1 \mathrm { H z } } ,$ which is due to the formation of an EDL at the PSG/IZO interface.Under the external electric field,an oriented protons flux will be triggered within the PSG flms by a sequence of proton hopping between hydroxyl groups and water molecules existed in nanogranular PSGfims1usprotonswillacumulateatthe/ZO interface， resulting in a large EDL capacitance. The bias dependent EDL capacitances have also been studied,as shown in Figure 2d.It is observed that the EDL capacitance is scattered between 1.8 and $2 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { F } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ with the bias ranged between $- 0 . 5$ and $+ 1 . 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ ，Though the protons fluxes are triggered by the external electric field, the EDL capacitance will not be affected by the bias applied on the PSG films obviously. Thus,in the configuration of lateral coupled transistors,the bias on the lateral gate would modulate the interplay between protons and electrons at the PSG/IZO channel interface.As a result,the carrier transport characteristics of the IZO channel will be modulated,as discussed below. The inset in Figure 2d shows the leakage current of PSG flms measured on the inplane sandwich structure.A low leakage current below $\mathrm { \Delta } S \mathrm { \ n A }$ is obtained in the voltage ranged from $- 1 . 5$ to $+ 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { ~ V } ,$ （204号 guaranteeing that the drain current $\left( I _ { \mathrm { D S } } \right)$ will not be affected by the leakage current.

Figure 3a shows the typical output characteristics ( $\mathrm { \Delta } T _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ vs $V _ { \mathrm { D S } } )$ of the laterally coupled IZO transistor. $V _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ is scanning from O to $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { V } ,$ ，while $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ is increased from $- 0 . 6$ to $+ 1 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ in steps of $0 . 2 \mathrm { V }$ ，The output characteristics of the IZO transistor in accumulation exhibit a strong saturation and a clear pinch off. At low $V _ { \mathrm { D S } } , I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ increases linearly with $V _ { \mathrm { D S } } ,$ indicating that the device has a good ohmic contact. Figure 3b shows the transfer characteristics $\left( I _ { \mathrm { D S } } { \bf v s } V _ { \mathrm { G S } } \right)$ of the device with a constant $V _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ ，The sweep rate is $5 0 \mathrm { ~ m V } / \mathrm { s }$ .A clear anticlockwise hysteresis window $\overline { { \big ( \Delta V _ { \mathrm { t h } } \big ) } }$ of ${ \sim } 0 . 3 \mathrm { V }$ is observed,which is likely due to the existences of mobile protons within the $\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ proton conductor28-30Thecurrenton/ffratio is estimated tobe ${ \sim } 5$ $\times ~ 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ . The results indicate that the gate bias triggers the protons flux within the PSG layers，modulating the IZO channel conductivities obviously.Alow subthreshold swing of $\mathrm { \sim } 1 1 0 \ \mathrm { \ m V / }$ decade is observed on the laterally coupled IZO transistor.A threshold voltage $( V _ { \mathrm { t h } } )$ of ${ \sim } . 0 . 4 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ is estimated from the $I _ { \mathrm { D S } } ^ { 1 / 2 }$ s $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ plot, indicatingthat the device operates in a depletion mode. Field-effect mobility $( \mu _ { \mathrm { F E } } )$ in the saturation region can be obtained by the following equation:22

$$
I _ { \mathrm { D S } } = \frac { \mu _ { \mathrm { { _ { F E } } } } W C _ { 0 } } { 2 L } ( V _ { \mathrm { G S } } - V _ { \mathrm { t h } } ) ^ { 2 }
$$

where $W$ is channel width of $1 0 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { { m } }$ and $L$ is channel length of $8 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m } .$ ，whereas $C _ { 0 }$ is the EDL capacitance of ${ \sim } 2 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { F / c m } ^ { 2 }$

The $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ -dependent $\mu _ { \mathrm { F E } }$ is shown in Figure 3c.A maximum mobility of ${ \sim } 2 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } ~ \mathrm { V } ^ { - 1 } ~ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ is obtained. To investigate the interface state density $( N _ { \mathrm { i t } } )$ at the PSG/IZO channel interface, the transfer curve of the lateral coupled TFT was measured at the linear region with a fixed $V _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ of $0 . 2 \mathrm { V } _ { \cdot }$ ，as shown in Figure 3d.The subthreshold swing(S) is estimated to be ${ \sim } 8 9 ~ \mathrm { \ m V / }$ decade.The interface state density $( N _ { \mathrm { i t } } )$ can be estimated by the following equation:31

$$
N _ { \mathrm { i t } } = \left( \frac { S \mathrm { l o g } ( e ) } { k T / q } - 1 \right) \frac { C _ { 0 } } { q }
$$

where $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature $\left( 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { ~ K ~ } \right)$ and $q$ is the electron charge. $N _ { \mathrm { i t } }$ is estimated to be $\sim 6 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } \ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 2 } }$ ， which is comparable to that for high-koxide/semiconductor interface.32,33

The results discussed above indicate that the proton gating would modulate the channel conductance significantly Transient characteristics could reflect the dynamic properties for the proton gating.Moreover, the characteristic time as an important parameter for the proton gating is also meaningful for the interfacing between electrical signals and biological response in the biological systems.Here，transient channel current induced by gate pulses through proton gating are recorded. Figure 4a shows the transient $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ of the laterally coupled IZO transistor measured with a pulsed $V _ { \mathrm { G S } }$ (1 V,10 ms）under a constant $V _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ of $0 . 2 { \mathrm { V } } .$ At the end of the gate pulse, a peak $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ of ${ \sim } 2 1 . 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { A }$ is obtained.When the gate pulse is finished, $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ gradually decays back to the resting current of ${ \sim } 1 5$ $\mu \mathrm { A }$ in ${ \sim } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ .Thelateral migration of protons within PSG films plays an important role for the transient $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ .When a positive pulse voltage is applied on the lateral gate,protons wil migrate and accumulate at the PSG/IZO channel interface, thus a high $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ would be obtained,as shown in the top-left panel of Figure $4 \mathsf { a }$ ，When the pulse voltage is finished,protons will gradually drift back to their equilibrium positions. Correspondingly, $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ will decrease gradually back to the resting current. It was reported that hydrogen diffusion in a-Si， defect diffusion, oxygen vacancies diffusion and ion hopping transport in complex condensed-mater systems agreed well with a stretched

exponential model.34-37 Similarly, the movements of protons within nanogranular PSG films are also responsible for the decay process of $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ .Thus, $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ decay curves could be fitted by a stretched exponential function (SEF） shown below:37

$$
I _ { \mathrm { D S } } = ( I _ { 0 } - I _ { \infty } ) \mathrm { e x p } \Bigg [ - \bigg ( \frac { t - t _ { 0 } } { \tau } \bigg ) ^ { \beta } \Bigg ] + I _ { \infty }
$$

where $\tau$ is the retention time, $t _ { 0 }$ is the time when the pulse voltage is finished, $I _ { 0 }$ is the triggered current at the end of the pulse voltage, $I _ { \infty }$ is the resting current and $\beta$ is the stretch index ranging between O and 1.A good fitting curve for the $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ decay triggered by the gate pulse is obtained,as shown in Figure 4a (red line).The retention time $( \tau )$ is estimated to be ${ \sim } 1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ When several positive gate pulses $( 1 \mathrm { V } , 1 0 \mathrm { m } s )$ are applied on the laterally coupled IZO transistor,repeated transient ${ I _ { \mathrm { D S } } } ^ { \prime }$ s are observed,as shown in Figure $\boldsymbol { 4 \mathrm { b } }$ Each transient $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ is also fitted with eq 4.The obtained $\tau$ values are shown in Figure $_ { 4 c }$ with highly stabilities.

The transient ${ \cal I } _ { \mathrm { D S } } \mathrm { } ^ { \prime } { \bf s }$ induced by negative gate pulses through proton gating are also recorded. When several negative gate pulses $( \mathbf { \bar { - } } 1 \mathbf { \tilde { V } } , 1 0 \mathbf { m s } )$ are applied on the laterally coupled IZO transistor，repeated transient $I _ { \mathrm { D S } } \mathrm { ^ { * } }$ are also observed.The transient $I _ { \mathrm { D S } }$ 's are fitted with eq 4 too.Stable retention times $( \tau )$ of ${ \sim } 2 2 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ are obtained,as illustrated in Figure Sa.The retention time is bigger for negative gate pulses than that for positive gate pulses. Though，the slight changes，such differences can be explained as follows.The positive gate pulse will result in the accumulation of protons at the IZO channel/PSG interface.When the gate pulse ends, protons wil diffuse back; the positive drain bias will promote such diffusion. Thus， the retention time is smaller.On the contrary，the negative gate pulse will result in the accumulation of protons at the gate/PSG interface.When the gate pulse ends, the positive drain bias will restrain the back diffusion of protons.Thus, the retention time is bigger. The transient $I _ { \mathrm { D S } } \mathrm { } ^ { \prime } s$ are also triggered by positive pulses $( 1 \mathrm { V } , 1 0 \mathrm { m } s )$ ）and negative pulses $\left( - 1 \dot { \mathrm { V } } , 1 0 \mathrm { m s } \right)$ （204号 in a sequential mode.The retention times for each pulse are also obtained，as shown in Figure Sb. Interestingly，the retention time is always ${ \sim } 1 8$ ms for positive gate pulses and is always ${ \sim } 2 1$ ms for negative gate pulses. Thus, the positive pulses and the negative pulses will not affect the transient characteristics with each other.Moreover，it could also be concluded that the intrinsic properties for proton gating wil not be affected significantly by the gate pulses with the range between $^ { - 1 }$ and $+ 1 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } _ { }$ .The stable retention time also suggests that the proton gating is repeatable without electrochemical reaction at the interface.It is interesting to note here that the characteristic time for neural activity is several tens of millisecondsorundredsofmiliseconds2638 tuse poto gated laterally coupled IZO transistors are also interesting for neuromorphic system applications.

# 4.CONCLUSION

In summary，laterally coupled IZO transistors gated by nanogranular PSG films were fabricated on glass substrates at room temperature.Due to the modulation of the lateral protons flux within the PSG films, the IZO channel current would be modified correspondingly.Good transistor performances are obtained, including a low operation voltage of ${ \sim } 1 . 5 \mathrm { V } ,$ a low subthreshold swing of $\mathrm { \sim } 1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m V } .$ /decade,ahighcurrent on/off ratio of ${ \sim } 5 \times 1 0 ^ { \breve { 6 } }$ and a high $\mu _ { \mathrm { F E } }$ of ${ \sim } 2 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } ~ \mathrm { V } ^ { - 1 } ~ s ^ { - 1 }$ With the transient channel current triggered by gate pulses, the characteristic time for the proton gating is estimated to be ${ \sim } 2 0$ ms.Due to the similar characteristic time scale between the proton gating in the laterally coupled oxide transistors and the neural activities in a biological system, the proton gated devices proposed here are interesting for portable biosensors and neuromorphic system applications.
