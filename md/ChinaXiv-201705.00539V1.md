ABSTRACT: Flexible transparent conductive films (TCFs) areused in a variety of optoelectronic devices. However, their use is limited due to poor thermostability. We report hybrid TCFs incorporation in both aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) and silver nanowires $\left( { \tt A g N W s } \right)$ . The layered AZO/ AgNWs/AZO structure was deposited onto a transparent polyimide (PI) substrate and displayed excellent thermostability. When heated to $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h , ~ } }$ the change in resistivity $\left( R _ { c } \right)$ was less than $1 0 \%$ （ $\cdot  { R _ { \mathrm { c } } }$ of pure AgNW film $>$ 500) while retaining good photoelectric properties $\mathit { \tilde { ( R _ { \mathrm { s h } } = 8 . 6 } }$

$\mathrm { { \Delta O h m / s q } }$ and $T = 7 4 . 4 \%$ ). Layering the AgNW network between AZO films decreased the surface roughness ( $\mathit { R } _ { \mathrm { r m s } } < 8 \ \mathrm { n m } ,$ and enhances the mechanical flexibilityof the hybrid films.Thecombinationof these characteristics makes the hybrid flm an excellent candidate for substrates of novel flexible optoelectronic devices which require high-temperature processing.

# 1.INTRODUCTION

Transparent conductive films （TCFs） are crucial components of optoelectronic devices,including flat panel displays,touch screens,light-emiting diodes,and solar cells.1-8" Indium tin oxide(ITO）is a commonly used TCF material because of its advantageous trade-off between conductivity and transparency.9,10 However, the use of ITO in large-area and low-cost devices is undesirable as it requires expensive vacuum deposition techniques；additionally,indium is a scarce material.

Increasing efforts in developing nanomaterial TCFs have been_observed recently，including silver nanowire (AgNW) films12metal gsgtedsb tubes6dee show great promise as they display desirable electrical and optical properties.Furthermore,AgNWfilms can be deposited onto substrates using the solution deposition method, allowing for low-cost and high-throughput fabrication of devices.21 Although promising, pure AgNW films suffer several drawbacks, iisd film and a metal-oxide layer have been suggested as promising alternatives to overcome these isses.24-26

Metal-oxide layers were introduced to improve the adhesion of the AgNW film to the substrate.Furthermore,this hybrid film facilitated effective charge carrier collection,both by filling the empty spaces between the AgNW/substrate interface and by smoothing the film surface. We recently reported an aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/AgNW/AZO hybrid film ona polyethylene terephthalate(PET） substrate which displayeda sheet resistanceof $2 7 . 6 ~ \mathrm { O h m / s q }$ and transmittance of $8 0 . 5 \%$ 26 However，the hybrid films on PET_substrates subjected to a lower glass transition temperature $( T _ { \mathrm { g } } )$ of PET $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \ = \ 6 2 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right.$ for commonly used $\mathrm { P E T } ^ { 2 7 }$ ）showa clear disadvantage，where their thermostability is poor and limits their applications.

A highly transparent polyimide (PI) substrate which was ${ \sim } 5 0$ $\mu \mathrm { m }$ thick with an optical transmittance of $9 0 . 2 \%$ at $5 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ was prepared ona glass plate.AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films were then successfully fabricated by combining sputtering and rodcoating processes on the transparent PI substrate.The hybrid film exhibited a low sheet resistance of $8 . 6 ~ \mathrm { O h m / s q }$ and a high transmittance of $7 4 . 4 \%$ .Importantly, they also showed excellent thermal stability,mechanical flexibility,and adhesion.

# 2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

2.1.Materials.The reagents used in this study included silver nitrate $( \mathrm { A g N O } _ { 3 } )$ ，poly(vinylpyrrolidone）(PVP，K-30)，sodium chloride $\mathrm { ( N a C l ) }$ ，ethylene glycol (EG)，acetone,ethanol,and $N , N \mathrm { . }$ dimethylacetamide (DMAc).All reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.All chemicals were used as received without further purification.

2.2.Synthesis of Silver Nanowires.Silver nanowires were fabricated using a modified polyol reduction.Approximately $_ { 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of PVP was dissolved in $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of EG by heating the solution to $1 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with stirring for 1h.A $\mathrm { { N a C l } }$ solution ( $\mathsf { \widetilde { . 5 0 ~ } } \mu \mathrm { L } \mathsf { \widetilde { \Omega } } 0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ in EG)was then added into the flask and stirred for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ A $\mathrm { A g N O } _ { 3 }$ solution $( 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L } ,$

$0 . 0 5 9 \mathrm { { M } }$ in EG) was subsequently added to the flask dropwise at a rate of $\bar { s } \ \mathrm { m L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ .The clear solution changed colors through yellow,redorange, green, dark gray, and finally to glistening gray， which indicated the formation of long AgNWs. The reaction was allowed to cool to ambient temperature after $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The solution was then centrifuged (3 times at $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ )to remove EG,PVP,and other impurities from the supernatant after adding acetone.The AgNWs were suspended in ethanol at a concentration of $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m g { \cdot m L } ^ { - 1 } }$ (Figure 1d). The length anddiameterof theAgNWswas ${ \sim } 1 2 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ and ${ \sim } 7 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ，respectively. 2.3.Synthesisof theTransparent PlSubstrate.The PI powder used to prepare the highly transparent PI films was synthesized according to our previous studies. $^ { 2 8 ^ { \circ } } \mathrm { A }$ clear PI solution in DMAc (10 wt $\%$ )was prepared (Figure la).The preparation of the transparent PI film,which typically resulted in a ${ \sim } 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ thick layer,is illustrated schematically in Figure 1b.After the PI solution was cast on a clean glass plate,it was heated in an oven at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to remove the solvent and then subjected to a heating schedule of 1oo,150,and 200 $^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $6 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at each temperature.The transparent PI substrate displayed an optical transmittance of $9 0 . 2 \%$ at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ (Figure 1c).

2.4.Fabrication of the AZO/AgNW/AZO/Pl Hybrid Film. AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films were deposited on top of the transparent PI substrate using the RF sputtering and rod-coating method. Both top and bottom AZO layers were sputtered using an AZO target at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with a contrast RF power of $2 0 0 \mathrm { W } .$ an Ar flow of $3 0 \ \mathrm { s c c m } ,$ and a working pressure of 3 mTorr. The AgNW layer was deposited on the bottom AZO layer with $N$ numbers of rod-coating cyclesand then dried at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $3 \mathrm { m i n }$ to remove the solvent before the top AZO layer was deposited.A schematic of the process is shown in Figure le.

To test the effectiveness of the transparent and flexible hybrid films, a simple conductive circuit was fabricated by depositing silver nanoparticle ink on a photo paper substrate.This was done using inkjet printing methods according to published procedures.26 Both the AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid film andLEDs were incorporated into the circuit.The hybrid film was tested after SOO inner bending cycles and successfully powered the LEDs which were visible through the transparent hybrid film (Figure 1f).

Furthermore,the pure AZO films and pure AgNW films were also prepared by depositing under the same conditions without the AgNW layerand by the rod coating of the AgNW suspension,respectively.

2.5.Characterization. Surface and cross-section morphologies of the AgNW/AZO and AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid filmswere examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM，Hitachi S-48oo).The surface roughness of the AgNW/AZO and AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films was examined using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco Dimension310oV).The silver content of the AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films was quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (Agilent 700 Series)．AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films were submersed in $6 5 \%$ nitric acid solutions for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ to completely dissolve the AgNWs. The solutions were then transferred to volumetric flasks.The optical transmittance of the pure AZO and AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films was determined at room temperature using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 95o,USA） with an integrating sphere.The sheet resistance was measured using a four-point probe system (Cresbox,Napson Corp.).The mechanical stability test was performed using a lab-made bending test machine.The adhesion test was performed using 3M stock tapes.The thermal stability test was performed by measuring the variation in the film resistance as a function of temperature.

# 3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

# 3.1.Microstructure of AZO/AgNW/AZO Hybrid Films.

A cross-sectional image of a AgNW/AZO/PI hybrid film after sintering at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ is shown in Figure 2a.The sintered AgNWs were packed densely, forminga well-contacted network.When the top AZO film was sputtered at $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ the final thickness of the AZO/AgNW/AZO/PI hybrid film was ${ \sim } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ (Figure 2b).The individual AgNWs were naturally interconnected at their junctions during the AZO deposition. The toughing point of the AgNW network eats each other and forms a firm thermowelding junction that conducts after the thermal annealing process.The mean surface roughness of the AgNW/AZO/PI film was $9 3 . 7 \ \mathrm { n m }$ (Figure 2c)，which was significantly larger than that of the final AZO/AgNW/AZO/PI hybridfilm ( $7 . 2 8 ~ \mathrm { n m } ,$ ,Figure 2d).Thus, the top AZO layer both protected the AgNW network from oxidation and decreased the surface roughness of the AgNW network by filling the area between AgNWs.29

SEM images of AZO/AgNW/AZO/PI hybrid films with different numbers of AgNW rod-coating cycles $( N )$ are shown in Figure 3.The density of the AgNW network increased as $N$ increased,as can be seen in Figure $3 \mathrm { a - d } .$ TheAgNWsexhibited well-connected wire-wire junctions,and AgNWs embedded into the AZO films showed a randomly percolated network structure. The corresponding mass density of the AgNWs in the hybrid films increased from 5.8 to $4 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m g / m } ^ { 2 }$ with the increasing numbers of $N .$

3.2.Electrical and Optical Properties of AZO/AgNW/ AZO/Pl Hybrid Films.The optical transmittance spectra of the hybrid films with increasing numbers $N$ are shown in Figure 4； the sheet resistance values of each film are also given. The pure AZO flm displayed a high optical transmittance of $8 7 . 9 \%$ at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ with a sheet resistance of $8 0 . 3 \mathrm { \ O h m / s q }$ .Thehybrid film transmittance decreased as the number of $N$ increased. This change was caused by light reflection and scattering from both the AgNWs and the AgNW/AZO interface.

Figure 4.Optical transmittance and sheet resistance of the AZO/ AgNW/AZO hybrid films.

The sheet resistance of the hybrid films decreased as $N$ increased. The AZO/1AgNW/AZO $\left( N = 1 \right)$ ）sample displayed a sheet resistance of $6 0 . 2 \mathrm { \ O h m / s q }$ with a transmittance of $8 2 . 6 \%$ at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ，whereas the AZO/8AgNW/AZO $\left( N = 8 \right)$ （204 sample displayed a sheet resistance of $4 . 7 \ \mathrm { \ O h m / s q }$ with a transmittance of $6 4 . 7 \%$ at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .Theseresults indicated that the AgNW density can be adjusted to optimize the optical and electrical properties of AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films. The sheet resistance and optical transmittance at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ were used to determine which hybrid film displayed the best electrooptical performance by calculating the figure of merit $( \Phi )$ as defined by the Haacke equation30

$$
\phi = \frac { T ^ { 1 0 } } { R _ { s } }
$$

where $T$ and ${  { R _ { s } } }$ are the transmittance at $5 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and sheet resistance of the hybrid films,respectively.The hybrid film with optimal optoelectronic characteristics was the AZO/SAgNW/ AZO $\left( N \bar { = } 5 \right)$ sample which had a $\Phi$ value of $6 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \Omega ^ { - 1 }$ (Table 1),which is larger than our previously reported record of $4 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \Omega ^ { - 1 }$ when deposited on a PET substrate.25 The following equation was used to elucidate the electrical contribution of the AgNWs in AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films31

$$
\frac { 1 } { R _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } } } = \frac { 2 } { R _ { \mathrm { A Z O } } } + \frac { 1 } { R _ { \mathrm { A g N W } } }
$$

where $R _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } } , \ R _ { \mathrm { A Z O } } ,$ and $R _ { \mathrm { A g N W } }$ are the sheet resistance of the hybrid,AZO,and AgNW films,respectively. The AZO layers were sputtered on the PI substrate at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ which can decrease the sheet resistance of the AZO layers.We reported that the sheet resistance of a pure AZO layer $( 8 0 . 3 \mathrm { O h m } / \mathrm { s q } )$ is lower than that of AZO sputtered at room temperature onto a PET substrate $( 3 0 8 . 7 ~ \mathrm { { \fontfamily { q p h m } \selectfont { O h m / s q } } } )$ 0.26 Furthermore,the use of higher sputtering temperature promoted fusing of the AgNW network，which also resulted in lower sheet resistance value. This“synergistic effect”helped to improve the $\Phi$ values of the AZO/AgNW/AZO/PIhybrid films.

3.3.Mechanical Properties of AZO/AgNW/AZO/PI Hybrid Films.Both outer bending and inner bending tests were performed using a lab-made apparatus at a fixed bending radius of $3 \mathrm { m m }$ (Figure Sa and $5 \mathrm { b }$ ).The tests involved different numbers of bending cycles.The mechanical flexibility of a pure AZO and AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films was compared. The nominal bending strain can be calculated using the following equation32

$$

where $\varepsilon _ { \mathrm { f } } \ h ,$ and $r$ are the nominal bending strain,substrate thickness,and bending radius,respectively.The typical bending strain in our study was $0 . 8 3 \%$

The surface morphologies of the pure AZO and AZO/ 5AgNW/AZO $( N \bar { } = 5 )$ hybrid filmsafter SoO cycles of the outer bending test are shown in Figure Sc and Sd, respectively. Cracks are visible in both films.Near straight-line cracks, perpendicular to the tension direction, were observed when the bending cycles reached a critical value. The spacing of the cracks in the pure AZO film was closer than that of the hybrid film,which led to a sharp increase in the electrical resistance. Notably，the embedded AgNW layer in the AZO/5AgNW/ AZO $\left( N = 5 \right)$ hybrid film acted as a conducting bridge to connect the broken AZO film and hinder crack propagation after S00 cycles of the outer bending test.This phenomenon is attributed to the flexible and ductile nature of the AgNWs, which in turn enhanced the flexibility of the hybrid flms.

The surface morphologies of the pure AZO flm after 300 cycles and the AZO/5AgNW/AZO $\left( N = 5 \right)$ hybrid filmsafter 500 cycles of the inner bending test are shown in Figure Seand Sf,respectively.As the defect density between the AZO film and the AgNW network was relatively large，cracks in the hybrid film were not straight but polyline under compression. The cracks propagated preferentially along the AZO/AgNW interfaces while breaking the wires when the crack initiated in AZO encountered the AgNWs.33 Thus, delamination occurred during the inner bending test,which was more destructive to the hybrid films than that of the outer bending test.

The change in the sheet resistance as a function of bending cycles for the pure AZO and AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films is shown in Figure 6.The change in the film resistance $\left( R _ { \mathrm { c } } \right)$ can be expressed as

$$
R _ { \mathrm { c } } = \left( R - R _ { 0 } \right) / R _ { 0 }
$$

where $R _ { 0 }$ is the initial sheet resistance and R is the value as measured after the bending test.Resistance changes were recorded three times for each bending cycle.AZO films are fragile and inflexible.The pure AZO film cracked in the initial stages of the outer bending test.After the cracks has formed, the film displayed a sharp increase in sheet resistance.34 The sheet resistance changes in both the pure AZO and the AZO/ AgNW/AZO hybrid films after the outer bending test are shown in Figure 6a.The AZO film exhibited a large increase in resistance due to crack formation and propagation with increasing numbers of bending cycles.35 The value of $R _ { \mathrm { c } }$ for the pure AZO film after SO0 outer bending cycles was 158.In contrast, the value of $R _ { \mathrm { c } }$ for the AZO/SAgNW/AZO $\left( N = 5 \right)$ hybrid film after SOo bending cycles was 7. The considerable reduction in the value of $R _ { \mathrm { c } }$ for the hybrid film was attributed to the flexibility imparted by the AgNWs embedded between the inorganic metal oxide films.The sheet resistance changes in the pure AZO and AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films after the inner bending test are shown in Figure 6b. As expected, a large $R _ { \mathrm { c } }$ value of 142O was observed for the pure AZO film after only 300 inner bending cycles. The electrical conductance of pure AZO was severely damaged.However, the AZO/SAgNW/AZO （20 $\left( N = 5 \right)$ ）hybrid filmexhibiteda $R _ { \mathrm { c } }$ value of less than 40,even after SOo bending cycles.Notably, the values of $R _ { \mathrm { c } }$ for the inner bending test were greater than those of the outer bending test. These results were attributed to different fracture mechanisms between the two tests.Additionally， the delamination that occurred in the inner bending test was more destructive than the cracking.

Adhesion is critical for successful flexible devices.To test the adhesion of the hybrid films to the substrates,3M tape was applied to the films and then peeled off. SEM images of an AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid film and a pure AgNW film before and after the adhesion test are shown in Figure 7.The AZO/ AgNW/AZO hybrid film did not show any visible film destruction (Figure 7a),and the corresponding sheet resistance values remained consistent $( \sim 5 ~ \mathrm { { \ O h m / s q } } )$ ．Conversely，the adhesion of the pure AgNW flm to the substrate was poor (Figure 7b).The sheet resistance of the pure AgNW film increased from 5.0 to $> 1 0 ^ { 6 } \ \mathrm { O h m / s q }$ after the 3M taping test. These results suggested that the hybrid flms had a strong mechanical adhesion to the substrate because the AgNWs were coveredby the top AZO layer and embedded into both AZO layers,which prevented film detachment.

3.4.Thermal Stability of AZO/AgNW/AZO/PI Hybrid Films.The thermal stability of the pure AgNW and AZO/ AgNW/AZO hybrid films on PI substrates was examined by heating the films and testing the change in resistance.A plot of the change in resistance as a function of temperature is shown in Figure 8a.A gradual decrease in sheet resistance of the pure AgNW film was observed up to $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，This indicated the contacts between the AgNWs were fusing together.However,a clear rise in sheet resistance was observed when the film was annealed in air at $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ (Figure 8c).This result was attributed to heat-induced weldingof adjacent AgNWs,and the AgNW network was due to partial coalescence.36 The morphology of the AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films remained intact without any melt down or disconnections after annealing in air at $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for1h (Figure 8b).This result indicated that the hybrid flm had greater thermostability than the pure AgNW film. The high-temperature stability of the hybrid film resulted from the AgNW flm being effectively protected by the thermally stable AZO films.

# 4.CONCLUSIONS

Ahighly transparent PI substrate with an optical transmittance of $9 0 . 2 \%$ at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ was synthesized by simple casting of the PI solution onto a glass plate.AZO/AgNW/AZO hybrid films were fabricated by combining sputtering and rod-coating processes on top of the transparent PI substrate.By adjusting the number of AgNW rod-coating cycles,a typical hybrid film with a low sheet resistance of $8 . 6 \mathrm { O h m / s q }$ ,a high transmittance of $7 4 . 4 \%$ ,and a figure of merit of $6 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \Omega ^ { - 1 }$ was obtained. The mechanical properties of pure AZO and AZO/AgNW/ AZO hybrid films were also investigated.The hybrid flm displayed superior outer bending flexibility over inner bending The higher $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ value of the PI substrate enable annealing of the hybrid films at temperatures up to $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h , ~ }$ at which the films remained stable.The reported TCFs containing AZO/ AgNW/AZO/PI hybrid films displayed high transparency, excellent conductivity,flexibility,and thermal stability.As such, they have significant potential for applications in highperformance，flexible electronics，energy storage，and photovoltaic devices.
