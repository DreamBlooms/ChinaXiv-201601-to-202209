There are important differences between the latitudinal structure of trends for the second half of the 2Oth century and for the 2lst century (2000-2014)(Fig.3).For example,the Arctic latitudes have shown strong warming trends both over the land and ocean since 2ooo,but during the latter half of the 2Oth century,the ocean trends in this area are near zero.The longer-term 50-year trend has more consistency in the rates of warming across all latitudes,and this is even more evident over the fullperiodof recordback to 1880 (fig.S1).There is a distinct Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude cooling in LST during the 2lst century,which is also showing up in cooling of the cold extremes,as reported for the extreme minimum temperatures in this zone in (27).Atmospheric teleconnections and regional forcings could be relevant in understanding these short time-scale zonal trends.Itis evident that in most latitude bands,the global trends in the past 15 years are comparable with trends in the preceding 50 years.

Last, we considered the impact of larger warming rates in high latitudes (24) on the overall global trend. To estimate the magnitude of the additional warming,we applied large-area interpolation over the polesusing the limited observationaldataavailable.Resultsindicatethat,indeed additional global warming of a fewhundredths of a degree Celsius per decade over the 2lst century is evident (Fig.1),providing further evidence against the notion of a recent warming“hiatus" (supplementarymaterials).

Newly corrected and updated global surface temperature data from NOAA's NCEI do not support the notion of a global warming“hiatus." As shown in Fig.1, there is no discernable (statistical or otherwise）decrease in the rate of warming between the second half of the 20th century and the first15 years of the 2lst century. Our new analysis now shows that the trend over theperiod1950-1999,a timewidelyagreed as having significant anthropogenic global warming $( I )$ ,is $0 . 1 1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ decade-1,which is virtually indistinguishable from the trend over the period 2000-2014（ $_ { \mathrm { 0 . 1 1 6 ^ { \circ } C } }$ decade-1).Even starting a trend calculation with 1998,the extremely warm ElNino year that is often used as the beginning of the “hiatus,”our global temperature trend (1998-2014) is $0 . 1 0 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ decade-1-and we know that is an underestimate because of incomplete coverage over the Arctic.Indeed,according to our newanalysis, the IPCC's $( I )$ statement of2 years ago-that the global surface temperature “has showna much smaller increasing linear trend over the past15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years"-is no longer valid.

# A parvalbumin-positive excitatory visual pathway to trigger fear responses in mice

Congping Shang,1,2 Zhihui Liu,1 Zijun Chen,1,2 Yingchao Shi,1,2 Qian Wang,1 Su Liu,1 Dapeng Li,1 Peng Cao1\*

The fear responses to environmental threats play a fundamental role in survival. Little is known about the neural circuits specifically processing threat-relevant sensory information in the mammalian brain.We identified parvalbumin-positive $( \mathsf { P } \mathsf { V } ^ { + } )$ excitatory projection neurons in mouse superior colliculus (SC)as a key neuronal subtype for detecting looming objects and triggering fear responses.These neurons,distributed predominantly in the superficial SC,divergently projected to different brain areas,including the parabigeminal nucleus (PBGN),an intermediate station leading to the amygdala. Activation of the $\mathsf { P V } ^ { + }$ SC-PBGN pathway triggered fear responses,induced conditioned aversion,and caused depression-related behaviors.Approximately $20 \%$ of mice subjected to the fearconditioning paradigm developed a generalized fear memory.

二 nvietathsreed 【 brain areas to trigger fear responses The superior colliculus (SC) is a retinal re- $( \boldsymbol { I } , \boldsymbol { 2 } )$ cipient structure (3,4) composed of different neuronal subtypes $( 5 , \ 6 ) ;$ ，including parvalbuminpositive $( \mathrm { P V } ^ { + } ) ;$ somatostatin-positive $( \mathrm { S S T ^ { + } } )$ ，and vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive $( \mathrm { { V I P ^ { + } } ) }$ neurons (Fig.1A and fig. S1). In addition to mediating orienting responses $( 7 ) _ { : }$ ，the SC contributes to avoidance and defense-like behaviors (8-11).

With an optogenetic approach (12-14),we found that activation of neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in mouse SC triggered freezing that lasted $5 2 . 8 \pm 5 . 3$ S ${ \mathrm { ~ \it ~ \mathscr ~ { ~ n ~ } ~ } } = 5$ mice) (movie S1).This prompted us to systematically identify the key neuronal subtypes underlying this behavior.

By crossing Ai32 $( I 5 )$ with different Cre lines (Fig.1B) (I6,I7),we expressed ChR2-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein(EYFP）in specific neuronal subtypes in the SC (Fig.iC and fig. S1) and optogenetically elicited spikes in acute slices (Fig.ID and fig. S1).Activation of SC $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ neurons, but not $\mathrm { { s s T } ^ { + } }$ or $\mathrm { { W P ^ { + } } }$ neurons, triggered impulsive escaping $( 1 . 1 8 \pm 0 . 0 9$ s)followed by long-lasting freezing $( 4 6 . 4 \pm 2 . 8 \$ s) (Fig. 1,E to G; fig. Sl; and movie S2). To avoid activation of $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (I8) by ferrule light, we injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing double-floxed ChR2-mCherry $( I 2 )$ into the SC of PV-ires-Cre mice,resulting in specific expression of ChR2-mCherry in SC PV+ neurons but not in $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ RGCs (Fig.2A and fig. S2). The light triggered spikes from ChR2-mCherry-positive neurons in SC slices(Fig.2B and fig. S2),elicited a similar stereotyped locomotor pattern (fig.S2andmovieS3),andincreasedthe heart rateand plasma corticosterone levels that were not observed in mice with SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons expressing mCherry (Fig.2,C and D).

When facing threats,animals can either fight or flee.To test whether SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons were involved in this behavioral dichotomy,we measured the durations of light-induced escaping (E)and freezing(F)and calculated their ratio (E/F ratio).We conducted a series of tests spanning5 days (table S1).First,light stimulations with higher intensity or longer duration enhanced E/F ratios in the same male mice by prolonging escaping more strongly than freezing (Fig.2,E andF).Second, light stimulationswith higher frequency but similar total illumination time prolonged escaping and freezing proportionally (Fig.2G).Third, both responses showed strong adaptation to repetitive light stimulations (every $5 \ \mathrm { m i n } ;$ ),with no significant change in $\mathrm { E / F }$ ratios across each stimulation (Fig.2H).Finally, the same light stimulations elicited longer escaping and shorter freezing in female versus malemice,resultinginhigher $\mathrm { E / F }$ ratios in females (Fig. 2I).The origin of these sexually dimorphic behaviors was further examined (supplementary text).

We next characterized the morphological and physiological properties of SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons. They were predominantly but not exclusively distributed in the superficial gray (SuG) layer of the SC (Fig.3A and fig. S3).Whole-cell recording of tdTomato-expressing $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons in SC slices from PV-ires-Cre;Ai9 mice (19) demonstrated that,distinct from V1 $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ interneurons with slow frequency adaptation (2o),the SuG $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ neurons responded to depolarizing currents in a faster adaptation mode(Figs.3,C and D,and fig. S3). SuG $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons labeled with neurobiotin had parallel dendrites extending to the SC surface,presumably receiving inputs from RGCs (Fig.3B and fig.S3).The postsynaptic currents from PV-negative neurons induced by optogenetic activation of $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ neurons expressing ChR2-mCherry were blocked by $\scriptstyle \mathrm { { D - } } ( - ) - 2$ -amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline $^ { 2 , 3 }$ -dione (CNQX), but not bypicrotoxin(Fig.3,EandF,and fig. S3),suggesting that these neurons were glutamatergic but did not release $\gamma$ -aminobutyric acid. The SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons in intermediate and deep layers of the SC were examined (supplementary text).

To test whether SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons were involved in detecting collision threats in the visual field (21-23),we displayed a virtual soccer ball moving in controlled velocities and directions to the anaesthetized mice (Fig.3Jand fig. S4).The singleunit activity recorded with optrodes was quantitatively identified (24,25) as putative SC $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ neurons expressing ChR2-mCherry (Fig. 3,G to I).These putative $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons ${ \mathit { n } } = 9$ cells) were strongly activated by the ball moving toward the animal but not by the motion in the other five directions (Fig. 3K).The response onset time before collision depended on the size and velocity of the ball (Fig.3L)and was linearly correlated with the square root of the diameter/ velocity (Fig.3M).The response peak was close tothetimeto collision and wasindependent of the size and velocity of the soccer ball (Fig. 3N).In freely behaving mice,the escaping triggered by SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neuron activation pointed to the side of the SC receiving light stimulation (movie S4).

Wethen determinedthecircuit mechanism underlying the fear responses mediated by SC $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ neurons. By injecting AAV expressing doublefloxed monomeric green fluorescent protein (mGFP) into the SC of PV-ires-Cre mice,we specifically labeled SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons (Fig.4B and figs.S5 and S6)and observed axon terminals in the parabigeminal nucleus (PBGN), the pontine nucleus $( \mathrm { P n } )$ ,and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLGN) (Fig.4,A and C). These projections were confirmed by retrograde tracing withcholeratoxinBwithAlexaFluor-594(CTB594). CTB-594 injection into the PBGN (Fig. 4D) retrogradelylabeledSCneuronspredominantly in the ipsilateral SuG layer (Fig.4E and fig.S7). A considerable proportion of CTB-labeled SC neurons (SC-PBGN: $5 2 \pm 4 . 3 \%$ ; SC-Pn: $3 1 \pm 4 . 5 \%$ SC-DLGN: $3 3 \pm 3 . 8 \%$ 5 $n = 3$ mice)were positive for PV (Fig.4F and fig. S7).

To determine which of these parallel projections (26) participated in the fear responses, we injected AAV expressing double-floxed ChR2- mCherry into the SCandimplantedoptic fibers in the PBGN or Pn (Fig.4G) to locally stimulate the ChR2-mCherry-positive axon terminals.Activation of the $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ SC-PBGN pathway,but not the $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ SC-Pn pathway,triggered the stereotyped

Taken together, these data revealed a $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ excitatory visual pathway to trigger stereotyped fear responses in mice.

Our data lead to the following conclusions. First, the SC $\mathrm { P V } ^ { + }$ neurons form a subcortical visual pathwaythat transmitsthreat-relevant visual informationto the amygdalato trigger fear responses.These data, in alliance with earlier studies (18,30,3I),suggesta “retina-SC-PBGN-amygdalahypothalamus”pathwayforvision-inducedfear responses. Second, the SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons in the SuGlayer are predominantly glutamatergic projection neurons with spiking patterns distinct from those of their counterparts in corticalregions.Thus,thisfindingbroadensthe concept of $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons (32)and adds another perspective to understanding their functions. Third, the SC $\mathrm { P V ^ { + } }$ neurons may belong to type $\mathsf { \Phi } ^ { - } \mathsf { P }$ looming detector,supporting the notion that mathematically defined computational units correspond to specific neuronal subtypes (33).

Bacterial adaptive immunity uses CRlSPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated (Cas) proteins together with CRlSPR transcripts for foreign DNA degradation.In type IlCRlSPR-Cas systems,activation of Cas9 endonuclease for DNA recognition upon guide RNA binding occurs by an unknown mechanism. Crystal structures of Cas9 bound to single-guide RNA reveal a conformation distinct from both the apo and DNA-bound states,in which the 1O-nucleotide RNA“seed"sequence required for initial DNA interrogation is preordered inan A-form conformation.This segment of the guide RNA is essential for Cas9 to form a DNA recognition-competent structure that is poised to engage double-stranded DNA target sequences.We construe this as convergent evolution of a “seed"mechanism reminiscent of that used by Argonaute proteins during RNA interference in eukaryotes.

cleaves DNAat sites defined by the 2O-nucleotide   
(nt) guide segment within crRNAs, together with   
a trans-activatingcrRNA(tracrRNA)(2) that forms   
a crRNA:tracrRNAhybrid structure capable of   
Cas9association (3).Onceassembled on target   
DNA,the Cas9HNHandRuvC nuclease domains   
cleave the double-stranded DNA(dsDNA) sequence   
within the strands that are complementary and   
noncomplementary to the guide RNA segment,   
respectively (3,4) (Fig.1A).Byengineeringa syn

The utility of Cas9 for both bacterial immunity and genome engineering applications relies on accurateDNAtargetselection.Targetchoicerelies on base pairing between the DNA and the 20-nt guide RNA sequence,as well as the presence of a 2-to 4-base pair (bp) protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) proximal to the target site(3,4). The target complementarity of a “seed" sequence within the guide segment of crRNAs is critical for DNA recognitionand cleavage (7,8).In type II CRISPR systems, Cas9binds to targetsbyrecognizing a

PAMand searching the adjacent DNA for complementarityto the10-to 12-nt“seed"sequence at the $3 ^ { \prime }$ end of the guide RNA segment (Fig. IB) (3,9-I1).Crystal structures of Cas9 bound to sgRNAand a targetDNA strand,with or without a partial PAM-containing nontarget strand, show the entire 2O-nt guide RNA segment engaged in an A-form helical interaction with the target DNA strand (I2,I3).How the “seed"region within the guide RNA specifies DNA binding has remained unknown.

To determine how Cas9 assembles with and positions the guide RNA prior to substrate recognition,we solved the crystal structure of catalytically active Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) in complex with an 85-nt sgRNA at $2 . 9 \textup { \AA }$ resolution (Fig.1and table S1).The overall structure of the Cas9-sgRNA binary complex,representing the pre-target-bound state of the enzyme,resembles the bilobed architecture of the target DNAbound state,as observed in electron microscopic studies $( I 4 )$ ,with the guide segment of the sgRNA positioned in the central channel between the nuclease and helical recognition lobes (Fig.1, C to E).This structural architecture and guide RNA organizationis maintained in the crystal structure ofa widely used nuclease-inactive version of Cas9 (D10A/H84oA,referred to as dCas9) in complex with sgRNA (fig. S1).

Comparison of SpyCas9 crystal structures representing the protein alone and the RNA-bound and RNA-DNA-bound states of the enzyme reveals the nature of Cas9's conformational flexibility duringsgRNAbindingandtargetDNArecognition (Fig.2A and figs. S2 and S3). The helical recognition lobe undergoes substantial rearrangements upon sgRNA binding but before DNA association, especiallyin helical domain 3,which moves as a rigidbody by ${ \sim } 6 5 \mathrm { \AA }$ into close proximity with the HNH domain (fig. S2D). Superposition of the Cas9-sgRNApre-target-bound complex onto the targetDNA-bound structuresreveals further
