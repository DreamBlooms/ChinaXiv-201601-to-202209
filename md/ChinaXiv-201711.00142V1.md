ABSTRACTMany researchers have studied on perovskite oxide for its unique structure. Perovskite oxides, $\mathrm { \bf A B O } _ { 3 - }$ ，with different A and B metals have shown wide applications in many fields, in particular solid oxide electrolysers. $\mathrm { S r F e O } _ { 3 - }$ ,typical perovskite oxides, in which iron is the mixed-valence cation with the capacity to change the chemical valence, have a wide range of oxygen nonstoichiometry. In this study, $\mathrm { S r _ { 0 . 9 } F e _ { 0 . 9 } Z r _ { 0 . 1 } O _ { 3 - } }$ (SFZO) is synthesized and then treated in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and air at high temperature,exhibiting excellent redox stability. Redox-stable structure, oxygen vacancy and electrical properties of SFZO are investigated. Steam electrolysis is then performed with SFZO cathode under $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ atmospheres, respectively.The present results indicate that the SFZO is a novel promising cathode material for solid oxide steam electrolyser.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The perovskite oxides, $\mathbf { A B O } _ { 3 - \delta }$ ,have attracted numerous attention for many years due to the unique structure. Perovskite-type oxides have a large flexibility of the structure,in which the valence state of mixed-valence transition metal (TM) cations could change to some extent,as well as the number of oxygen vacancies[1-3l. Meanwhile, $\mathrm { A B O } _ { 3 - \delta }$ oxides have exhibited fascinating properties, and have been studied on many fields such as oxygen permeable membranes[4],photocatalysis[5], magnetic materials[6],solid oxide fuelcells (SOFCs)7] and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs)[8].

（204号 $\mathrm { S r F e O } _ { 3 - } \ ,$ typical perovskite oxides, contain mixed-valence iron cations presented as $\mathrm { F e ^ { 4 + } }$ in B-site that could transform to lower valence state at low oxygen partial pressure accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies[9]. It is no doubt that the phase structure of strontium ferrates can transform, at relatively stronger reducing atmosphere, from cubic to orthorhombic brown millrite phase,in which oxygen vacancies agregate and ultimately represent ordering[10l. Oxygen vacancies usually exist in perovskites as point defects,and have nonnegligible influence on its structure and electronic properties.The appropriate amount of oxygen vacancies is in favour of the oxygen-ion transmission,resulting in good electronic properties; whereas,a sufciently high concentration of oxygen vacancies is not favourable as it can aggregate,arrnge orderly and even give rise to phase transformation.Asa result，the oxide ion conduction and electrical conductivity are drastically reduced[11].

In this work,the $\mathrm { z } \mathrm { r }$ doping perovskite $\mathrm { S r _ { 0 . 9 } F e _ { 0 . 9 } Z r _ { 0 . 1 } O _ { 3 - \delta } }$ (SFZO） is synthesized by solid state reaction method to suppress the phase transition.The structure，oxygen vacancies，electrical properties and electrochemical properties of SFZO are systematically studied. Steam electrolysis is then performed with SFZO cathode.

# 2.1 Materials and apparatus

Perovskite $\mathrm { S r _ { 0 . 9 } F e _ { 0 . 9 } Z r _ { 0 . 1 } O _ { 3 - \delta } }$ (SFZO） powder was prepared by a traditional solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric $\mathrm { S r C O } _ { 3 }$ ， $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { Z r O } _ { 2 }$ (all chemicals used in this current investigation were $9 9 \%$ AR from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd) were completely mixed by grounding in a zirconia bal mill for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ （20 at a speed of 1OOO rounds per min,and then pressed into pellets followed by calcination in air at $1 3 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { ~ o } } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 0 \mathrm { h }$ . The SFZO samples were reduced in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ at $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ for $3 \mathrm { h }$

The phase analysis of the as-synthesized SFZO powder was performed by X-ray difraction (XRD) at room temperature using D/MAX250oV, Rigaku Corporation, Japan $\left( \mathrm { C u } K \alpha , 2 \theta = 2 0 \mathrm { \ 8 0 ^ { \circ } } \right)$ at a scan rate of $3 ^ { \circ } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ The surface microstructure of the electrolyser was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, JSM-6490LV, JEOL Ltd, Japan). Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis (TEM) was used to investigate the oxidized SFZO powder with a JEOL 21OOF field emission transmission electron microscope operating at $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k V } .$ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS，AlK $\boldsymbol { \mathscr { a } }$ ，ESCALAB25,Thermo,America） was employed to analyze the chemical state of the elements on SFZO surface before and after high temperature treatment in $5 \%$ $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ at $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { ~ o ~ C ~ } }$ for $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ . TGA testing of the reduced SFZO powder was conducted using a thermal analyzer in air with the temperature changing from 320 to $1 0 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a speed of $5  { \mathrm { ~ \textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }  { \mathrm { m i n } } ^ { - 1 }$ （STA449F3， Naichi Corporation, Germany).The conductivities of samples were measured with a direct current four-probe method by an electrochemical workstation (Keithley 2Ooo,Digital Multimeter, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA) n the air atmosphere and reducing $( 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r } )$ atmosphere with temperature ranging from 650 to $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ , respectively. The dependence of conductivity on the oxygen partial pressure was measured at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { ~ o ~ C ~ } }$ by an online multimeter (Keithley 2O00,Digital Multimeter，Keithley Instruments Inc.，USA）and the oxygen partial pressure ranging from $1 0 ^ { - 1 7 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 0 }$ atm was recorded by online oxygen sensor (OXYGEN-MODEL 3000-SX).

# 2.2Symmetrical cells preparation

The 2-mm-thick 8YSZ electrolyte support was prepared by dry-pressing the 8YSZ powders into a disk with a diameter of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ followed by sintering in air at $1 5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ { o } C } }$ for $2 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .Two surfaces of the YSZ electrolyte support were mechanically polished and ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and acetone. The $\mathrm { C e } _ { 0 . 8 } \mathrm { S m } _ { 0 . 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } .$ （204号 (SDC) powders were prepared by the combustion method in which the $\mathrm { S m } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { C e } ( \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } ) _ { 3 } { \cdot } 6 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ powders were mixed evenly and sintered at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ 1 $( 3 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { ~ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ ）for $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ in air. The cathode slurry of SFZO-SDC was formed by mixing the prepared SFZO-SDC powder (at a ratio $6 5 { : } 3 5 \ \mathrm { w t } \%$ ),alpha-terpineol, and appropriate amounts of celllose additive. Then the cathode slurry was printed onto the two surfaces of the prepared cleaned YSZ discs with an area of approximately $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ ,followed by sintering in air at $1 1 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { ~ o } } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to assemble symmetrical cells.Ag paste (SS-8060, Xinluyi, Shanghai, China) was used as a current collector covering anode and cathode surfaces,and $\mathbf { A } \mathbf { g }$ wire ( $\mathrm { 0 . 2 ~ m m }$ in diameter) was used for connecting the electrodes to the electrochemical equipment, followed by firing in air at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . The symmetrical cells (SFZO-SDC/YSZ/SFZO-SDC） were measured by the electrochemical workstation (IM6,Zahner, Germany） at open circuit voltage(OCV） at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ under different hydrogen partial pressure and different oxygen partial pressure, respectively. The applied frequency was in the range of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m H z } ~ 4 ~ \mathrm { { M H z } } }$ ，with a voltage amplitude of $1 0 \mathrm { m V } .$ The flow rate of gas was $5 0 \ \mathrm { m l \ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ , controlled by a mass flow meter (D08-5F, Sevenstar, Beijing, China).

# 2.3 Electrolysis cells preparation

The powders of $( \mathrm { L a } _ { 0 . 8 } \mathrm { S r } _ { 0 . 2 } ) _ { 0 . 9 5 } \mathrm { M n O } _ { 3 - \delta }$ (LSM) were synthesized using solid state reaction by mixing the proper amounts of $\mathrm { L a } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ， $\mathrm { S r C O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathbf { M n O } _ { 2 }$ and the treatment temperature was $1 1 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ $( 3 ^ { \mathrm { ~ o } } \mathrm { C } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 } .$ )for $1 0 \mathrm { { h } }$ in air. The LSM slurry was formed by mixing the prepared LSM-SDC powder (at a ratio $6 5 { : } 3 5 \ \mathrm { \ w t \% }$ ， alpha-terpineol,and appropriate amounts of celllose additive.Then the SFZO-SDC slurry was printed onto the cathode surfaces and the LSM slurry onto the anode surfaces of YSZ discs with an area of approximate 0.2 $\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ ，respectively, followed by sintering in air for $3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $1 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ to assemble the single solid oxide cells (SFZO-DC/YSZ/LSM-SDC). The single solid-oxide electrolysers were sealed by ceramic paste (JD-767A, Jiudian, Dongguan, China) to a home-made testing apparatus for electrochemical measurements, including AC impedance and current-voltage curve (I-V curve). The single solid oxide electrolysers were investigated for direct hydrogen electrolysis. The $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ yield was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2014, SHIMADEU, Japan) under each new different applied voltage.

# 3 RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

# 3.1Analysis of the crystal structure

Fig.1 shows the XRD patterns of the oxide powers at $1 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ { o } C } }$ in air for $2 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，which confirms that the perovskite-type $\mathrm { S r F e O } _ { 3 }$ and SFZO are pure phase. However, the phase transition from cubic perovskite to orthorhombic structure $( { \bf S } \Gamma _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \bf O } _ { 5 } )$ ）has been observed for $\mathrm { S r F e O } _ { 3 }$ sample after reduction[12],as shown in Fig. 1 (a),suggesting a weak phase stability in reducing atmosphere.In contrast,as shown in Fig.1(b), no phase transitions or impurites are observed for SFZO even treated at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ for $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .The partial replacement of Fe with $Z \mathrm { r }$ has effectively improved the phase stability of SFZO even in strong reducing atmosphere. According to the Scherrer Equation $\mathrm { L } = \mathrm { K \mathcal { M } } / \beta \mathrm { c o s } \theta ^ { [ 1 3 ] }$ ,the crystal cell parameter of the oxidized SFZO is determined to be $3 . 9 0 8 \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ , which is slightly smaller than that of the reduced SFZO (3.921 A). This is because the $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 4 + } ( 0 . 5 8 5 \mathring { \mathrm { A } } )$ is partially reduced to $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + } ( 0 . 6 4 5 \mathring \mathrm { A } )$ , which may give rise to expansion of the cell volume as the oxygen loss is present after high temperature reduction.

# 3.2 Oxygen vacancy and transition metal

Fig. 2(a) shows the TGA tests for the reduced SFZO from 320 to $1 0 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ 1 $\mathrm { 5 ^ { \circ } C \ m i n ^ { \cdot 1 } }$ ）in air. In the range of $3 2 0 { \sim } 4 7 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the weight increase is attributed to the oxidation of $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ to its higher valent state $( { \mathrm { F e } } ^ { 4 + } ) ^ { [ 1 4 ] }$ with consequent oxygen gain as the same time, accompanied by the $0 . 1 5 6 ~ \mathrm { m o l }$ oxygen gain per chemical formula. In the range of $4 7 6 { \sim } 1 0 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { ~ o } } \mathrm { C }$ ,an increased weight loss is observed, which is ascribed to the reduction of $\mathrm { F e ^ { 4 + } }$ （204号 to $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ as well as the lossof lattice oxygen,accompanied by the 0.121 mol oxygen loss per chemical formula at high temperature. The thermally induced latice oxygen loss creates oxygen vacancies over $4 7 6 ~ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ Asa result, to maintain the charge balance, the valence state of Fe ions changes from $^ { 4 + }$ 0 $3 + ^ { [ 1 5 - 1 7 ] }$ .Fig. 2(b) shows the typical microstructures and lattice constant of the obtained SFZO powders.The lattice constant is $0 . 3 8 3 { \mathrm { ~ n m } }$ ， presenting a similar lattice constant as reported for the (111) plane[18,19].

In order to confirm the change in elemental valence,XPS analysis is performed to test the oxidized and reduced SFZO samples,respectively. All XPS patterns are fited using a Shirley-type background subtraction method and the background functions for different spectra of different elements are fitted using $80 \%$ Gaussian and $20 \%$ Lorentzian functions[2ol. All information of XPS peak comes from the database of Thermo Fisher Scientific[21l. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the Fe $2 p$ spectrum can be deconvoluted with three spinorbital doublet pairs that are originated from diferent chemical coordination of Fe.The first one is at binding energies of $7 0 9 . 9 \mathrm { e V }$ (Fe 2p3/2) and $7 2 2 . 7 8 \mathrm { e V }$ (Fe 2p1/2), corresponding to $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ ions; the second one is at $7 1 0 . 4 \mathrm { e V }$ (Fe $2 p 3 / 2 )$ and $7 2 3 . 5 \mathrm { e V }$ (Fe $2 p 1 / 2 )$ , corresponding to the average valence state of Fe between $^ { 2 + }$ and $^ { 3 + }$ ; and the third one is at $7 1 1 . 4 \mathrm { e V }$ (Fe $2 p 3 / 2 \AA$ and $7 2 5 . 0 8 \mathrm { ~ e V }$ (Fe $2 p 1 / 2 )$ , assigned to $\mathrm { F e ^ { 4 + } }$ . In Fig. 3(b), the $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + } \left( 2 p 3 / 2 \right)$ ， $\mathrm { F e ^ { 3 + } } ( 2 p 3 / 2 ) , \mathrm { F e ^ { 2 + } } ( 2 p 1 / 2 )$ and $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + } \left( 2 p 1 / 2 \right)$ peaks are observed at 714.70, 711.88, 728.08 and $7 2 4 . 8 8 \mathrm { e V }$ in the reduced SFZO sample, respectively. According to the fitting results, the ratio of $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ is about 2.1 in the reduced SFZO sample. Moreover, the shift of Fe binding energy between oxidized and reduced samples is attributed to the iron valence state change of $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ to $\mathrm { F e ^ { 4 + } }$ . In the meantime,the amount of oxygen lattice changes, which is consistent with the result of TGA analysis[2, 23].

# 3.3 Electrical and electrochemical properties

The conductivity with a positive temperature coefficient for SFZO is shown in Fig. 4(a). The conductivities increase with the temperature and finally reach approximate $7 . 0 \ \mathrm { S c m ^ { - 1 } }$ in air and $1 . 5 \ \mathrm { S c m ^ { - 1 } }$ in ${ 5 \% } \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r } ,$ （204号 respectively. It should be noted that the conductivity of reduced SFZO is higher than the reported values for LSCM at high temperatures[24].Fig. 4(b） shows the dependence of conductivity on oxygen partial pressure where the conductivity increases from 0.3 to $7 . 0 \mathrm { { S } \ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ , with the oxygen partial pressure ranging from $1 0 ^ { - 1 7 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 0 }$ atm at $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { ~ o ~ C ~ } }$ . A typical p-type conduction has been demonstrated for the SFZO oxide while small n-type conduction is still observed at low oxygen partial because of the reversible change between $\mathrm { F e ^ { 4 + } }$ $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ and $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ The decrease of conductivity in the reducing atmosphere is ascribed to the decrease of concentration of charge carrier at low oxygen partial pressure atmosphere that leads to the generation of oxygen vacancy.

Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the AC impedance plots of symmetric cells with a configuration of SFZO-SDC/YSZ/SFZO-SDC tested under hydrogen and oxygen partial pressure, respectively. The ohmic resistance $( R _ { s } )$ of impedance spectra is subtracted for the comparison of electrode polarization resistances.The intercept with real axis in the impedance spectra corresponds to the electrode polarization resistance $( R _ { p } )$ ， measured by Zview softwarel25l. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the $R _ { p }$ of the symmetric cell decreases from 5.74 to $2 . 2 9 \Omega \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ with the hydrogen partial pressure ranging from 5 to $100 \%$ , suggesting that reducing atmosphere benefits the electrode polarization improving.In Fig.5(b),the electrode polarization resistance is 0.71, 0.51, 0.39 and $0 . 3 \Omega \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ under 2,5,10 and $20 \%$ （20 $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ ，respectively. This result indicates that SFZO can be a potentially promising candidate as cathode or anode in SOECs.

Fig. 6(a) shows the microstructure of a single electrolyser with the configuration of (cathode) SFZO-SDC/YSZ/LSM-SDC (anode). It can be found that the two porous electrode layers are approximately $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ in thickness,and adhere wel to te YSZ electrolyte.The steam electrolysis was performed at diffrent applied voltages with $5 \% \mathrm { { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { { A r } } } } }$ and $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ fed into the cathode, ranging from 1.0 to $2 . 0 \mathrm { V }$ at 800 $^ \mathrm { { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ ,respectively. Fig. 6(b) shows the typical curves of the current density versus voltage (I-V curves) of the electrolysers for direct steam electrolysis.In order to check the sealing of single solid oxide electrolyser, the open circuit voltage (OCV) is recorded. The OCV of the solid oxide electrolyser reaches about $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m V } }$ when cathode is fed with $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ while OCV reaches $1 . 1 \mathrm { V }$ fed with $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ at $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ ,which reflects a reasonable separation between anodic and cathodic gases.There exist two diffrent cell processes in the voltage region: (a)the electrochemical reduction of cathodes and the oxidation of anodes at low voltages; (b) the steam electrolysis at high voltages. Above $1 . 1 ~ \mathrm { V } _ { : }$ ，the current densities increase steeply with both two diferent atmospheres fed in the SFZO cathode, which indicates that the SFZO electrode with zircoium doping significantly promotes the phase stability,resulting in good cellperformances under reducing atmosphere. The current density of the solid oxide electrolyser based on the SFZO composite cathode fed with $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ increases from about 7.8 to $3 2 5 \mathrm { \ m A } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，with the applied potential ranging from 1.0 to $2 . 0 \mathrm { V } .$ The maximum current density reaches $3 2 6 { \mathrm { ~ m A ~ c m } } ^ { - 2 }$ at $2 . 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ when $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ is fed into cathode.All of the above indicates that the SFZO-SDC electrode shows a good cell performance for steam electrolysis even under reducing atmosphere.

To further study the electrochemical performance of electrodes, in situ AC impendence spectroscopy was used to investigate the polarization resistance of the cels under different applied voltages.Fig.7 shows the in situ AC impedance spectroscopy of the electrolysis cells based on SFZO under diffrent applied voltages ranging from 1.2 to $1 . 7 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { ~ o ~ C ~ } }$ in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ ，respectively. Two main electrochemical processes (cathode reduction at low voltages and steam electrolysis at high voltages) exist in the range of $1 . 2 { \sim } 1 . 7 \mathrm { V }$ during the electrolysis process under both two different atmospheres. As shown in Fig. 7 (a1,a2) in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ $R _ { p }$ values considerably decrease with the applied voltage increasing from 1.2 to $1 . 7 ~ \mathrm { V } .$ The increasing applied voltage can electrochemically reduce the cathode,which increases the mixed conductivity of SFZO,and accordingly enhances the electrode performance as well.Two semicircles are noted on the impedance spectroscopy: the high-frequency arcs $( R _ { 1 } )$ at high frequencies and low-frequency arcs $( R _ { 2 } )$ at low frequencies.The $R _ { 1 }$ of the solid oxide electrolysers based on SFZO cathode is stable in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ , indicating that the charge transfer at high frequency remains stable. At low frequency, the $R _ { 2 }$ （204号 is slightly decreased from 3.74 to $3 . 6 7 \ \Omega \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ at the applied voltage of $1 . 2 \ 1 . 7 \ \mathrm { V } ;$ ，suggesting the improved kinetics of gas conversion. Fig.7(b1,b2) shows the in situ AC impendence spectroscopy of the SFZO-SDC composite cathode in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ atmosphere.A similar phenomenon is observed in the less reducing atmosphere,which reveals that there are appropriate amounts of oxygen vacancies in the $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ atmosphere.

Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the electrolysis performances of SFZO cathodes fed with $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ ，respectively. The current density with $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ fed into the cathode reaches approximate 78, 207 and $2 6 5 \mathrm { \ m A \ c m ^ { - 2 } }$ at 1.2, 1.6 and $1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { V } _ { : }$ ,respectively. Similarly,the current density with $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ fed into cathode arrives to 98, 212 and $2 6 6 \mathrm { m A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at 1.2, 1.6 and $1 . 8 { \mathrm { V } } ,$ respectively. It is quite obvious that the SFZO cathode demonstrates similar performances in two diferent atmospheres.Moreover, the SFZO shows a stable performance in a wide range of applied voltage, indicating reasonable phase stability under a stronger reducing atmosphere at high temperature. The performance of SFZO is comparable to the reported values of $4 1 { \sim } 1 7 3 \ \mathrm { m A }$ $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at $1 . 2 \ 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { V }$ at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ for a $2 \mathrm { - m m }$ -thick YSZ electrolyte supported electrolyser with 6 wt $\%$ $\mathrm { C o } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ -loaded LSM-BCZYZ cathode[26].

Fig. 8(c) and (d) show the rate of hydrogen production and the current efficiency of electrolysers based on SFZO composite cathode for steam electrolysis in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ at different applied voltages at $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ , respectively. The hydrogen production rates reach as high as $0 . 7 { \sim } 1 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m L } \mathrm { c m ^ { - 2 } } \mathrm { m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ for the cell at $1 . 2 \ 2 . 0 \mathrm { V }$ in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ atmosphere. In contrast, the hydrogen production rates get to $0 . 7 { \sim } 1 . 9 \mathrm { m L }$ （204号 $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 } \ \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ under the same conditions,which are around $30 \%$ higher than the performance in former $5 \% \mathrm { { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { { A r } } } } }$ atmosphere. Similarly, the current efficiency reaches $80 \%$ in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ atmosphere while only $70 \%$ is achieved in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ with the applied voltage ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 V. However, the current efficiency reaches as high as $90 \%$ at low voltages with SFZO cathode in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ because of the high catalytic activity in stronger reducing atmosphere. As we know,the SFZO is a typical p-type conductor and the conductivity in oxidizing atmosphere is around 1 order of magnitude higher than that in the reducing atmosphere. Similarly，the SFZO cathode is expected to demonstrate a lower conductivity in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ than that in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ atmosphere，which may be the reason why the cell with SFZO cathode in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ shows higher current efficiency at high voltages.

# 4 CONCLUSION

In this work,perovskite SFZO oxide is reported as a redox-stable cathode for solid oxide steam electrolyser. Excellent phase stability is achieved even only $10 \%$ Zr is doped to the Fe-based perovskite oxide，with appropriate number of oxygen vacancies. Electrical property measurements show that the SFZO is a typical conductor with 1.5 and $7 . 0 \mathrm { { S c m ^ { - 1 } } }$ in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and air at $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { C }$ . SFZO oxide exhibits superior SOEC cathode performance,and the current efficiency as high as $90 \%$ is achieved for steam electrolysis in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ at low voltages.Allof above indicates the enormous potential of SFZO in direct steam electrolysis.

In this study, $\mathrm { S r _ { 0 . 9 } F e _ { 0 . 9 } Z r _ { 0 . 1 } O _ { 3 - } }$ (SFZO） is synthesized and then treated in $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and air at high temperature，exhibiting excelent redox stability.Redox-stable structure， oxygen vacancy and electrical properties of the SFZO are investigated. Steam electrolysis is then performed with SFZO cathode under $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / 5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { A r }$ and $5 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { A r }$ atmospheres,respectively. The present results indicate that the SFZO is a novel promising cathode material for solid oxide steam electrolyser.
