Interplanet and interstellar travels require long-term propulsion of spacecrafts,whereas the conventional schemes of propulsionare limited by the velocity of the ejected massIn this study,alpha particles released by nuclear decayare considered as a potential solution for long-time acceleration.The principle of near-light-speed particle propulsion $( \mathsf { N c P P } )$ was elucidated and the stopping and range of ions in matter(SRIM) was used to predict theoretical accelerations.The results show that NcPP by means of alpha decay is feasible for long-term spacecraft propulsion and posture adjustment in space.A practical NcPP sail canachievea speed $> 1 5 0 \mathrm { k m } / s$ and reach the brink of the solar system faster than a mass equivalent solarsail.Finaly,to significantly improve the NcPP sail,the hypothesisof stimulatedacceleration of nuclear decay (SAND) was proposed,which may shorten the travel time to Mars to within 20 days.

# 1.Introduction

The fastest object artificially launched into space is NASA's New Horizons Spacecraft,which hasa speed of approximately $1 6 \mathrm { k m } / s$ and had just passed Pluto after 9.5 years of voyage (Harwood, 2006).In general,the time required to travel to Mars is 6-9 months (Gravier et al.,1972). Having reached the moon, traveling Mars will be of interest in the coming years.

The conventional rocket-style propulsion cannot accelerate spacecraftto very high speed because of the limited velocity of the ejected mass.Asan example,a powerful chemical fuel ofa rocket is liquid $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ and $0 _ { 2 }$ ,andthe effective exhaust velocity of the reaction products is approximately $4 . 3 \mathrm { k m } / s$ ，Because of the limited exhaust velocity,it is difficult to accelerate to high speed by a single-stage rocket (Sutton and Oscar, 2O1O). The plasma engine VASIMR by NASA(Cassady et al., 201O;Longmier et al., 2012) can emit particlesat a speed of $5 0 \mathrm { k m } / s$ ，which has been the fastest exhaust speed for engines currently. However, high voltage and large amount of energy are required,making it costly for interplanet exploration.Solar sails,which use light pressure from solar radiation,can produce long-time acceleration,which is decreased rapidly when it is far away from the Sun (Wright,1992).

The alpha decay particles have an initial speed of approximately $0 . 0 5 c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.The exhaust speed of the alpha particles is 3oo times higher than that of plasma engines,and $> 3 0 0 0$ times higher than that of the chemical fuels of rockets.Let us define the particles with speed $> 1 /$ 1000 of the light speed as the near-light-speed particles (Ncparticles).Alpha decay particles,as typical Nc-particles,may be a potential solution for long-time acceleration in space.

The concept of using the Nc-particles,such as radioisotope decay particles,for space propulsion has been studied in the past decades (Berman,1961;Bolonkin,1982;Fiehler and Oleson, 2005; Bolonkin,2oo5). The direct recoil propulsion is that some of the particles are emitted directly imparting kinetic energy to a spacecraft and maintaining the propulsion levels at distances from Sun compared with solar sail systems.The Nc-particles produce extremely high specific impulses,but generate very low thrust levels,not to mention in the desired direction,for a certain quantity of source.Many innovations have been proposed to decrease the weight of traditional sail,increase the thrust,and increase the propulsion efficiency by control thrust and thrust direction.Bolonkin(Bolonkin,2Oo5) decreased the weight of traditional sail forNc-particles by two to four timesand increased the thrust by three times.Kluever(Kluever,1997)and Colombo（Colombo et al.,2oo9）used the appropriate optimal low-thrust trajectories based on differential dynamic programming to allow control of thrust and thrust direction.The near-light-speed particle propulsion(NcPP）method allows a space vehicle to reach $> 2 0 0 \mathrm { k m } / s$ .Thus,it is a promisingapproach for long-term space traveling.However,the detailed study on the dependence of propulsion efficiency on different parameters of the designed devices has yet been performed.Hence,it is necessary to revisit space propulsion by the radioisotope decay particles,which may provide new clues for the application of decay particle propulsion in practice.

In this study, the Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the efficiency of the alpha particle-generated kinetic energyand momentum and analyze the feasibility of direct alpha decay propulsion;the propulsion and final velocity of the spacecraft by alpha decay propulsion were calculated and compared with the results of solar sails.Finally,future improvements of this technologywere discussed.

# 2.Principle of alpha decay-based propulsion

Alpha particles from natural decay are a common source of Ncparticles with energy in the range of 4-9 MeV.Because of their relatively large mass and two positive electric charges,alpha particles interact strongly with electrons and will stop within $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ in most condensed materials (Loveland et al., 2oo5). The thermal effect of nuclear decay has been utilized.The radioactive thermal generator(RTG） is currently the only human technology that enables extremely long-time supply of electricity for space probes (Bennett et al.,2oo8). Compact and neat nuclear decayreleased kinetic energy is converted to thermal energyand then to electricity in an RTG unit.Using $8 . 1 \mathrm { ~ k g }$ of plutonium-238 with $8 3 . 5 \%$ purity,40oO-W thermal power and 220-W electricity will be available fora time span of $> 2 0$ years.Currently, there has been no replacement for RTG in deep space travel.

An interesting question is whether the kinetic energy of alpha particles from nuclear decay can be directly used to generate propulsion.The answer is yes,when omnidirectional radiation is achieved (Bolonkin,1982). In general,a bulk decayable material will emit alpha particles in all directions with their momentums canceled out.However,if one side of the emission is shielded byan absorption layer,while the other side emits as usual,this could result in a net recoil force,as shown in Fig.1. For natural decay, this force might be tinny,but can last a long time.In space,this force can be used for producing long-time acceleration，and eventually,a much higher speed of space travel than the current record can be reached.Akeyadvantage is that nuclear decay can release Nc-particles without the requirement of additional energy.

# 3. Simulation of efficiency

In a bulk material, the Coulomb scattering with nucleus,which was used to estimate the diameter of atomic nucleus,can reveal the relationship between the scattering angle and the corresponding probability.For high-energy particles,the probability of high-angle scattering is rather small (Bethe,1953). The stopping power of nuclear Coulomb scattering is much smaller than the scattering caused by electrons (Boschini et al.,2O1O)；in other words,ionization is the main process for the energy loss of charged particles.

Fig.1.Principle of the alpha-decay propulsion.

In order to predict the efficiency of emitting alpha particles, Monte Carlo simulation using SRIM codes(Ziegler et al.,2O10) was adopted in this study,and the residual energy and penetration depth in a nuclear material were investigated.First,as a validation, penetration behaviors of 5-MeV alpha particles in gold were simulated and the results were compared with experimental observations (Comfort et al.,1966). The computational results are in excellent agreement with the measured ones (Fig.2A). Second, similar schemes to predict the correlation between penetration depth and particle residual energy of alpha particles were used for the decayable materials,pure uranium, gold,and uranium dioxide.

It is obvious that only the momentum parallel to the forward direction is effective for propulsion,which can be termed as effective momentum.Thus,the effective momentum efficiency is defined as the ratio of the effective momentum to the overall momentum. Applying the modeling (see Supplementary Materials S1) and the simulation results from SRIM, the effective momentum efficiencies of 5-MeV alpha particle penetration as a function of foil thickness can be calculated,and are shown in Fig.2B.The following several pieces of important information can be revealed:

(1）The efficiency decreases monotonically with increasing thickness.The upper bound of momentum efficiency is $1 / 4$ So up to one-fourth of the initial momentum can contribute to propulsion in maximum.   
(2）For elemental materials such as gold and uranium,the efficiency curves are veryclose to each other. This is because these materials possess metallic features in electronic structureand the free electrons can interact withalpha particles in a similar manner.   
(3）For light elements,such as oxygen in uranium dioxide,the ability of stopping alpha particles is much lower,and hence the efficiency of uranium dioxide is higher than those of heavy metals.However,considering that the atomic densities of decayable elements in dioxide materialsare much lower than pure metal,the propulsion ability of dioxides may be lower than that of pure metals.   
(4）The effective momentum efficiency can be estimated by

$$
\eta _ { P , L } = \frac { \eta _ { P , 0 } ( L _ { i } - L ) } { L _ { i } } = \frac { ( L _ { i } - L ) } { 4 L _ { i } } ,
$$

where $L _ { i }$ is the intercept on the thickness axis of the linear fitting curve(Fig.2B) and $\eta _ { P , 0 }$ is the efficiency when thickness $= 0$ ，which

is constant (O.25),and the applicable range of $L$ within the linear scope of fitting curve is around $[ 0 , 1 / 2 L _ { i } ]$

# 4. Calculation of propulsion

In this section,the force generated by the NcPP sail was calculated,which isa foil of decayable material of several microns. With the predicted propulsion force and the total mass of the spacecraft, the acceleration of the NcPP sail can be obtained.From the acceleration,one can estimate the final velocity available for the NcPP sail.The mass loss effect during the decay is considered negligible (see Supplementary Materials S4).

In this study, $^ { 2 \bar { 3 } \bar { 2 } } \mathrm { U } ,$ （24号 $^ { 2 3 8 } \mathrm { P u }$ ,and their dioxides were chosen as the foil materials,because these synthetic isotopes possess moderately long half-lives of 68.9 and 87.7 years,respectively (Audi et al., 2003). The decay chains of these two isotopes (Lederer et al.,1968; Pritychenko et al.，2O14; Evaluated nuclear structure data file (ENSDF),1992) are shown in Fig. 3.

For ${ } ^ { 2 3 2 } \mathrm { U } ,$ the decay series emit six alpha particles and the halflives for the later five alpha decaysare much less than 68.9 years. Therefore,the emission of alpha particles can be considered as an immediate continuation of the first decay step,and the propulsion pressure of $^ { 2 3 2 } \mathrm { U }$ can be estimated as six times of that for materials with a single alpha particle emission. For $^ { 2 3 8 } \mathrm { P u }$ ,the alpha decay in the second or third step hasan extremely long half-life,and hence the following emitted alpha particles can be neglected. Considering the multi-emission effects of alpha particles,the formula for multiplypropulsion pressure is (see Supplementary Materials S2).

$$
P r _ { m } = \frac { \ln 2 } { T _ { 1 / 2 } } 0 . 5 ^ { \frac { t } { T _ { 1 / 2 } } } \frac { n \overline { { { P } } } L \overline { { { \eta _ { P } } } } \rho N _ { A \chi } } { M ^ { \prime } } , \ ,
$$

where $L , \rho , N _ { A } , \chi ,$ and $M ^ { \prime }$ are the thickness,mass density of decayable material,Avogadro's number,purity of the decayable isotopes,and the relative atomic mass of the compounds,respectively, $T _ { 1 / 2 }$ is half-life, $\overline { { P } }$ and $\overline { { \eta _ { P } } }$ indicate the average momentumand efficiency of emitted particles,and $n$ is the number of alphaparticle emissionsinamultistep decayreaction,thatis,the emission number.

The densities of pure uranium and plutonium are approximately $1 9 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ (CRC handbook of chemistry and physics, 2014) and those of their dioxides are approximately $1 1 \ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ (Sutton and Osor, 2010,http://www.webelements.com/). Assuming time $t " T _ { 1 / 2 }$ ，settingall emitting particles with energy $5 \mathrm { { M e V } }$ and $\chi = 1 .$ and substituting into Eq.(2),we obtain the propulsion pressure as a function of foil thickness (Fig. 4A). The propulsion pressure can reach $8 \mu \mathrm { N } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ for pure $^ { 2 3 2 } \mathrm { U }$ and approximately $1 \mu \mathrm { N } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ for $^ { 2 3 8 } \mathrm { { P u } . }$ （20 These values are in the same order of magnitude with that for the solarsails,which isapproximately $9 \mu \mathrm { N } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ when the sail is near the Earth in space (Wright,1992). In short, the propulsion generatedbyalpha decay foils is significant.

Because the propulsion force and the total mass increase simultaneously with the increasing foil thickness and larger mass mayresult in lower acceleration,the optimal value of the foil thickness to get the maximum acceleration or speed should be determined.When setting the $m _ { l o a d }$ as the mass of the spacecraft including the absorption layers and $\gamma$ as the ratio of the $m _ { l o a d }$ to the fuel mass,the formulas for optimal acceleration and optimally increased velocity of the spacecraft are (see Supplementary Materials S3).

$$
a _ { o p t } = \frac { \ln 2 } { 4 T _ { 1 / 2 } } 0 . 5 ^ { \frac { t } { T _ { 1 / 2 } } } \frac { n \overline { { { P } } } N _ { A \chi } } { M ^ { \prime } ( 1 + 2 \gamma ) }
$$

and.

$$
\Delta V = \ \int _ { t _ { 0 } } ^ { t _ { f } } \ : a _ { o p t } d t = \frac { 1 } { 4 } \frac { n \overline { { { P } } } N _ { A } \chi } { M ^ { \prime } ( 2 \gamma + 1 ) } \Bigg ( 0 . 5 \overline { { { ^ { T } 1 / 2 } } } - 0 . 5 \overline { { { ^ { T } 1 / 2 } } } \Bigg ) ,

respectively,where $t _ { O }$ and $t _ { f }$ are the initial and final times for the integral.

From Eq.(4),it can be found that the increased velocity only depends on emission number $n$ ，momentum $P ,$ atomic mass $M ^ { \prime }$ and mass ratio γat given $\chi , t _ { O }$ ,and $t _ { f } .$ The first three parameters are determined by the decayable material.The mass ratio γ has a significant effect on the maximum velocity.When setting $\chi = 1$ $t _ { 0 } = 0$ and $t _ { f } = \infty$ ,the increased velocityasa function of mass ratio $\gamma$ is shown in Fig.4B. If light-weighted absorption layer can be found,and the load is low with $\gamma { = } 0 . 2$ ,the increased velocity of $^ { 2 3 2 } \mathrm { U }$ and $^ { 2 3 8 } \mathrm { { P u } }$ can reach approximately 300 and $5 0 \mathrm { k m } / s$ respectively.When the more practical value of $\gamma = 1$ is used,the increased velocity could be approximately 140 and $2 0 \mathrm { k m } / s$ The results showan excellent agreement with Bolonkin's results(Bolonkin,2Oo5).It can also be seen that the acceleration effect of metalsis better than that of the dioxide.

# 5.Comparison ofNcPP sailsand solar sails

The solar sail is based on the solar radiation-generated photon pressure，which is proportional to the intensity of sunshine (Wright,1992).In 2010,the Japan-made solar sail spacecraft IKAROS was launched into space to travel to Venus (Small, 201O). It isinteresting to compare the NcPP sails with the solar sails.

For space travel calculations,let us ignore the influence of gravities of planets and suppose that the travel trajectory is directly away from the Sun and the distances to planets'orbits are estimated by the semi major axis.Because the solar pressure is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the Sun $( D )$ ,the pressure can be estimated as follows:

$$
P r _ { s o l a r } = P r _ { E a r t h } \frac { D _ { E a r t h } ^ { 2 } } { D ^ { 2 } } ,
$$

where $P r _ { E a r t h }$ and $D _ { E a r t h }$ are the solar pressure at the Earth and the distance between the Sun and the Earth.

Fora spacecraft with a load of $5 0 \mathrm { k g }$ and a load-fuel ratio of 1 $( \gamma = 1 . 0 )$ ！， $5 0 \mathrm { k g }$ of fuel is needed.When choosing pure metal as the NcPP sail material, the optimal thickness of the sail is $6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and the sail area is $4 6 3 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ ，for panel with diameter $2 4 . 3 \mathrm { m }$ .We then compare it with the solar sail with the same thickness and mass. Let us assume the material of the solar sail to be aluminum with density $2 . 7 \ : \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ and the area of the solar sail $3 0 8 7 { \mathrm { ~ m } } ^ { 2 }$ . Another assumptionadopted for the predictions is that acceleration starts from the Earth with an initial velocity of $1 6 \mathrm { k m } / s$ =

Table,1 shows the time needed to travel to Mars,Saturn,Pluto, and Proxima Centauri with load-fuel ratios $\boldsymbol { \gamma }$ of 1.0 and O.2.For a short-distance travel,the natural decay based on ${ \mathsf { N c P P } }$ sails does not possess obvious advantages compared with other propulsion technologies,because of their long half-lives. However, for a longdistance travel, the advantages of the NcPP sailsare notable.It can reduce the travel time to Proxima Centauri to $1 1 \%$ of that under the current technologies,approximatelya nine times improvement.At load-fuel ratio $\boldsymbol { \gamma }$ of 0.2,the final velocity for the $^ { 2 3 2 } \mathrm { U }$ NcPP sail can reach $3 0 0 \mathrm { k m } / s$ ,near $1 / 1 0 0 0$ of the light speed.However,a travel to Proxima Centauri still takes thousands of years.Interstellar travel definitely asks for even better propulsion technologies.

# 6.Hypothesis of SAND

For less-ambitious goals,the NcPP sails can be used for position and gesture maneuvering in space.It can be reliably used in satellites and space stations for many years.For the ambitious goal of leaving our solar system,a new mechanism of propulsion is needed.

According to Eq.(2),the half-life hasa significant effect on the propulsion pressure.Shorter half-lives could lead to higher propulsion,which indicates that higher acceleration can be achieved ifhalf-lifeisartificiallymodulated.Ideally,theNcPP sail material should havea stable state and excited state.In the stable state,it hasavery long half-life,exhibiting little propulsion,whereas in the excited state,its half-life can be extremely shortened byan external energy field.In this way,the NcPP material can release almost all of its Nc-particles immediately and generate a huge propulsion force.This turns the NcPP materials into much more convenient fuels,such as gasoline,which release their energy only upon ignition.

For example,with a half-life $< 1 \mathsf { d }$ ,the $^ { 2 3 2 } \mathrm { U }$ film (thickness $6 \mu \nu$ （20 can generate a propulsion pressure of approximately $0 . 1 5 \ : \mathrm { N } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ 元

With such high propulsion force,a velocity as high as $1 5 0 \mathrm { k m } / s$ could be achieved in several days,and the trip to Mars could be completed within 20 days.

Natural nuclear decay is relatively stable under normal energy fields.However,when ultra-intense laser radiation is used,nuclear energy levels can be excited and the half-life time constant could be modified,(Ledingham et al.,2OO3）which indicates that laser SAND(laser-stimulated acceleration of nuclear decay）may be a potential solution for our hypothesis.Some studies have been conducted using ultra-intense lasers in nuclear waste treatment revealingthe feasibility of SAND (Boundsand Dyer, 1992; Schwoerer et al.，2001；Belyaev et al.，2005). In general, new schemes,including novel designs of laser or decay materials, mightbe theaccessible solutions.Engineering feasible systems for space exploration awaits future exploration.
