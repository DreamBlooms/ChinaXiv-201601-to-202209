Homotypic membrane fusionof the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases),whichincludeatlastin(ATL)inmetazoansandSeylpinyast.Inthis paper,wedeterminedthecrystalstructuresofthecytosolicdomainofSeylpderivedfrom Candidaalbicans.The structures revealastalklike,helical bundle domain follwing the GTPase,which representsapreviouslyunidentifiedconfigurationofthedynamin superfamily.This domain is significantlylongerthan thatofATLand criticalforfusion.Seylpformsa side-by-sidedimer incomplex with GMP-PNP or $G D P / A l F _ { 4 } ^ { - }$ but is monomeric with GDP. Surprisingly, Seylp could mediate fusion without GTP hydrolysis, even though fusion was much more effcient with GTP.Seylpwasable to replace ATLin mammaliancels,andthe punctate localization ofSeylpwas dependenton its GTPase activity.Despite thecommon functionoffusogenic GTPases,our results reveal unique features of Seylp.

# Introduction

The ER network consists of a continuous membrane system of tubules and sheets (Shibata et al.,2OO6).ER membranes are interconnected by homotypic fusion to maintain a reticular patternand proper functioning.In metazoans,fusion is mediated byaclass of dynamin-like GTPases called atlastin (ATL;Hu et al.,2009;Orso et al.,2009).In other eukaryotic organisms lacking ATL,a similar class of GTPases,including Seylp in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hu etal.,2oo9;Anwar etal.,2012) and RHD3 in Arabidopsis thaliana (Zhang et al.,2O13),has been identified.Deletion of Seylp or depletion of ATL proteinsin cellsresults in unbranched ER(Hu et al.,2OO9),delayedERfusion(Anwar etal.,2O12),or evenERfragmentation (Orso et al.,2Oo9).When purified and reconstituted in vitro, members of both classes have been shown to mediate membrane fusion(Orso et al.,2OO9;Bian et al.,2011;Anwar et al.,2012; Zhang et al.,2013).

GTPase-based ER fusogens play critical physiological roles.In Candida albicans,deletion of Seylp results in decreasedvirulence(Yamada-Okabe and Yamada-Okabe,2OO2).In A.thaliana,lack of RHD3 leads to short and wavy root hairs and cell expansion defects (Schiefelbein and Somerville,199O; Chen et al.,2O11; Stefano et al.,2O12),and the deletion of another familymembercauses lethality (Zhang etal.,2O13).In Drosophila melanogasterand Danio rerio,depletion ofATL causes neuronal defects (Lee etal.,2OO8,20O9).In humans,mutations in ATL1, the dominant form of ATL in the central nervous system,are tightly associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia,a neurodegenerative disease characterized by axon shortening in corticospinal motor neurons and progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs (Zhao etal.,2OO1; Salinas et al.,2008).

ATL,Seylp,and RHD3 are anchored in the ER membrane by two closely spaced transmembrane(TM） segments, exposing both termini to the cytosol.The mechanism for homotypic ER fusion has been partially unveiled using ATLs (Hu et al.,2011;Lin et al.,2O12).It is very different from SNARE or viral protein-mediated fusion.Recent structural and biochemical studies indicate that the GTPase domain of ATL formsa dimer upon GTP binding,initiating contact between apposing membranes (Bian et al.,2O11;Byrnes and Sondermann,2011). The region following the GTPase domain is a three-helix bundle(3HB)and can dock to its own GTPase domain or that of a neighboring molecule, undergoing major conformational changes during the GTP cycle to drive fusion (Bian et al., 2011;

Byrnes et al.,2O13).Membrane tethering has also been shown to require continuous GTP hydrolysis ofATL(Saini et al.,2014; Liu et al.,2O15).Fusion is facilitated by a membrane-binding amphipathic helix in the C-terminal tail and the TM segments (Liu et al., 2012; Faust et al., 2015).

Identical membrane topology and conserved signature motifs in the GTPase domains of ATL and Seylp suggest that Seylp may behave similarly to ATL during membrane fusion. However, the predicted helical domain between the GTPase domain and TM segments is much longer ( ${ \sim } 3 0 0$ amino acids more）in Seylp compared with ATL.Furthermore,Seylp is concentrated in punctae along ER tubules,sometimes at threeWay junctions of tubules,whereas ATL1 is mostly distributed evenly on the ER membranes (Hu etal.,2Oo9).Therefore,it is unclear whether Seylp acts the same way as ATL.

Here,we elucidate how Seylp mediates homotypic membrane fusion.The proposed mechanism demonstrates a common scheme for fusion mediated by dynamin-like GTPasesand reveals that the stalk domain of Seylp possesses unique functional features.

# Results

# Crystal structures of the cytosolic domain of Sey1p

To investigate the mechanism of Seylp-mediated membrane fusion,we determined the structures of the cytosolic domains (cytSeylp)of Seylp from C.albicans (caSeylp).caSeylp shares $43 \%$ sequence identity with Seylp from S.cerevisiae (scSeylp;

see Fig.S1 A for sequence alignment).Residues 1-692 (truncation before the first TM region; Fig.1A) were expressed in Escherichia coli,purified,and crystallized first as an orthorhombic form in the presence of GDP plus $\mathrm { A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - }$ $( \mathrm { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - }$ .Astructure at $2 . 8 \mathrm { - } \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ resolution was determined by single anomalous diffraction(Table1),and an electron density map of the nucleotide is shown in Fig. S2 A. Only one caSeylp molecule was present in the asymmetric unit, but a crystallographic dimer occurred along one of the twofold symmetryaxes,similar to the hexagonal crystal form of human ATL1 (hsATL1, form1; Fig. S1 B).

CytSey1p consists of an N-terminal GTPase domain and a long,stalk-like,helical domain connected bya linker region (Fig.1B).In the dimer, the GTPase domains interact with one anotherin sucha way that the nucleotide binding sites face each other.The linker regions of the two Seylp molecules cross one another,allowing a close association of the tops of the stalk domains.The stalk domain is composed of four 3HBs,with the lasthelix of each bundle extending into the first helix of the next bundle (see Fig.1D for topology). The first 3HB (3HB-1) is positioned under the GTPase domain of the pairing protomer. If Seylp ended here,it would resemble the configuration of the crossover dimer of hsATL1 (form 1;Fig.S1,B and C).The second and third 3HBs (3HB-2 and -3) pivot around each other, so that the last 3HB (3HB-4) remains on the same side as the GTPase domain.3HB-4 is poorly ordered in general;a partially disordered long loop (residue 615-66O) is found between its second and third helices.

Nucleotide-dependent dimerization has been observed with many dynamin-like GTPases (GTPase dimer and Bian et al.,2011),but the configuration of the Seylp stalk domain has notbeen previously identified.The scale of the domainis comparable to that of bacterial dynamin-like protein (BDLP) and is longer than Dynamin-1 or human guanylate-binding protein 1(GBP1;Fig.S1 C).In BDLP structures, the stalk domain is composed of two four-helix bundles connected by a flexible hinge (Low andLowe,2006;Low et al.,2009).Major conformational changes, namely bending around the hinge, have been proposed for BDLP.In Dynamin-1 structures, the stalk consists of the bundle signaling element and one four-helix bundle,and it plays critical role in oligomerization (Faelber et al.,2011; Ford etal.,2O11).The stalkof GBP1 startswithtwo 3HBs arranged similarly as 3HB-1 and -2 in Seylp,followed by one longhelix thatreaches backto the bottomof the GTPase domain (Ghosh et al.,2O06). Unlike Seylp,the stalk domains of BDLP,GBP1,and Dynamin-1 interact extensively with their GTPase domains,suggesting that the GTPase-stalk linkage mayhave different rolesin these proteins.

The same crystal form was obtained when GMP-PNP,a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP,was added during purification and crystallization. Overall, the Seylp structure in GMP-PNP is similar to that of $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ ,with a root mean square deviation of only $0 . 3 7 0 9 \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ (Fig. S1 C). In contrast,a different conformation ofcytSeylp was observed when the protein was crystallized with GDP(Fig.1 C).This structure was determined from monoclinic crystals at $2 . 3 { \cdot } \mathring \mathrm { A }$ resolution using molecular replacement with the $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ structure as a search model (Table 1).One Seylp molecule is found in each asymmetric unit, but unlike the first structure,the stalk domain (mainly 3HB-1） is associated with the GTPase domain of the same molecule.In one of the crystallographic dimers,the GTPase domain of another Seylp molecule comes in close proximity (Fig. S1E). Such a crystallographic “dimer” would be reminiscent of form 2 of hsATL1 (Fig. S1 B),in which the 3HBs point in opposite directions and the GTPase domains form a dimer interface of $6 7 0 \mathring \mathrm { A } ^ { 2 }$ .However, this Seylp “dimer”buries only $4 5 5 \mathring { \mathrm { A } } ^ { 2 }$ of total surface area, suggestingless substantial contact between the two GTPase domains of the symmetry mates.These results imply that,despite the overall structural similarity between Seylp and ATL,these proteins likely undergo nucleotide-dependent dimerization differently.

# Nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis

The GTPase domain of caSeylp folds in a similar manner as other dynamin-like proteins.Itis composed of a central $\beta$ sheet surrounded by six $\alpha$ helices.The nucleotide at the active site is coordinated mainly by a magnesium ion and four signature motifs: the P-loop (G1, $\beta 1 { - } \alpha 1 \gamma$ ,the switch1 region (G2, $\alpha 1 - \beta 2 \prime$ 一 the switch 2 region (G3, $\beta 3 \ – \alpha 2 )$ ,and the G4 motif (after $\beta 5$ Fig.S2B).Most residues involving GTP binding are conserved between Seylp and ATLs (Fig. S2B).The two residues of ca

Seylp's G4 motif(R2O4 and D205) interact with the ribose of the nucleotide (Fig.S2 C) and are only seen in a subclass of the dynamin family that includes ATLs,Seylp,RHD3,and GBPs. However, S68 in the P-loop of caSeylp is equivalent to S41 in Dynamin-1 (Chappie et al.,201O),which is required for GTP hydrolysis (Fig. S2,B and D).When compared with dynamin-1, the side chain of S68 does not point directly at the $\gamma$ -phosphate bond of GTP and does not rotate during the transition state. Furthermore,a bridging sodium ion was found between S41 in dynamin-1 and the nucleotide (Fig. S2 D) but was not seen in Seylp.In ATLs,an Arg finger(R77in hsATL1) plays the same role at the position of S68 in caSeylp(Bian etal.,2O11;Byrnes et al.,2O13).This catalytic residue adopts a different rotamer conformation after the cleavage of the $\boldsymbol { \gamma }$ -phosphate bond,which in turn causes some minor local rearrangements (Fig. S2 D).

It is known that the GTPase activity of dynamin-1 is stimulated more than 1OO-fold,when self-assembled on lipid templates.Such dramatic increase was not seen with full-length scSeylp,when its GTPase activity in detergent was compared with that in reconstituted vesicles (Fig.S2E).As expected and similar to dynamin-1,mutant S47A in scSeylp (equivalent to S68A in caSeylp) was less efficient in hydrolyzing GTP (Fig. S2F).In addition,the side chain of caSeylp T95 and the backbone nitrogen of T94 and T95 engage the nucleotide. Consistent with the structural observations,mutation of scSeylp T75A (equivalent to T95A in caSeylp) reduces the enzymatic activity of the GTPase (Fig. S2,C and F).

# Dimerization-induced membrane fusion

Nucleotide-dependent dimer formationisa common feature of dynamin-like GTPases.ATL dimerization is physiologically significant because ATL1 dimer mutants are defective in GTP hydrolysis and membrane fusion,and one“hot spot”of the hsATL1 mutations causing hereditary spastic paraplegia is lo calized in the GTPase domain near the dimer interface (Bian et al.,2011). Seylp dimerization has been reported(Anwar et al., 2012) and was confirmed by our structural analysis (Fig.1 B). Notably,hsATL1 dimers were seen in all structures,regardless of which nucleotide was added (GMP-PNP, $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ and GDP),whereas caSeylp dimers only formed in the presence ofGMP-PNP or $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ ：

The dimerization of caSeylp involves a hydrophobic patch on top of the GTPase domain,including a conserved L257(L233 in scSeylp and L274 in hsATL1) within the guanine cap,and several hydrophilic interactions along the GTPase interface (Fig.2 A).The stalk domains also pack against each otherin the dimer.The closest association was in 3HB-2: N407 and N41O from one molecule interact with K467 from the other,and E417 makes a salt bridge with K475 (Fig.2 B). The bottoms of the stalk domains were also in proximity to each other.However,no substantial interactions were seen.The contact between the stalk domains occupies a surface area of $6 3 6 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ } ^ { 2 }$ ，despite the length of the domain. The overall dimer interface of caSeylp is $2 8 9 1 \mathrm { ~ \AA } ^ { 2 }$ ，with a total surface area of 36269 $\mathring { \mathbf { A } } ^ { 2 }$ for each caSeylp molecule.In contrast,hsATL1 dimerburies $2 , 1 7 9 \mathrm { \AA } ^ { 2 }$ in form 2 or $3 , 6 7 7 \mathrm { \AA } ^ { 2 }$ in form 3(with $9 4 9 \mathring { \mathrm { A } } ^ { 2 }$ contributed by the 3HBs),even when the total surface area of each hsATL1 is ${ \sim } 2 0 . 0 0 0 \mathring { \mathrm { A } } ^ { 2 }$ and the 3HB being much shorter than the stalk domain of Seylp.

To compare nucleotide-dependent dimerization of Seylp and ATL,we performed analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Asexpected,purified cytSeylp from S.cerevisiae behaved as a monomer in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of GDP, but it formed dimers in the presence ofGMP-PNP or GDP/ $\mathrm { A l F } _ { 4 } ^ { - }$ (Fig.2 C,left). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments revealed that the association of protomers was 57-fold stronger with GMP-PNP than with $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ (Fig. S3 A). In contrast, at the same protein concentration,cyt-hsATL1 exhibited much more stable dimer formation when $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ was present compared with GMP-PNP(Fig.2C,right;and Fig.S3B).The same conclusion was drawn with the FRET-based assay (Liu et al., 2015).These results imply that,unlike ATL, Seylp relies more on GTP binding than hydrolysis to achieve stable dimerization.

To probe the nucleotide requirement for Seylp-mediated fusion,we used an in vitro lipid-mixing assay.In this assay, purified full-length scSeylp was reconstituted into donor and acceptor vesicles as judged by flotation experiments (Fig.S4A). The donor vesicles contained lipids labeled with nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) and rhodamine at quenching concentrations; fusion with the unlabeled acceptor vesicles leads to fluorophore dilution and dequenching.Wild-type scSeylp resulted in efficient fusion in the presence ofGTP and $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { g } ^ { 2 + }$ .No fusion was seen with GDP or in the absence of $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { g } ^ { 2 + }$ (Fig.2 D). Interestingly, the addition of GMP-PNP caused moderate but reproducible fusion (Fig.2D).SuchactivitywasnotobservedforDrosophila ATL (dmATL) in the presence of GMP-PNP or $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ (Fig. S4 C).Collectively,these results suggest that the linkage of opposingmembranes through GTPbinding-induced dimerization maybe sufficient to promote Seylp-mediated fusion.

To confirm that GTP binding without hydrolysis can cause fusion,we performed a visual assay of membrane tethering and fusion.Wild-type full-length scSeylp was reconstituted into vesicles containing phospholipids with either a fluorescent Oregon green or Rhodamine dye attached to the head groups.Samples ofthe reactions were diluted and visualized with a confocal microscope.The vesicles initially appeared as green or red punctae (Fig.2F,left).As recently reported for ATL,large yellow punctae (i.e.,colocalization of the two dyes) appeared after the addition of GTP,indicating that the differently colored vesicles were associated or fused with one another(Fig.2F,middle).When EDTA,which chelates magnesium ions needed for nucleotide binding,was added,some of these large punctae disappeared or became smaller,indicating that some of the vesicles were untethered (Fig.2F,right).Very little tethering was seenin the presence of $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ (Fig. $2 \mathrm { H }$ ). In the presence ofGMP-PNP, alowlevel of fusion was observed and was not strongly affected byEDTA addition (Fig.2 G).These results confirmed that the addition of GMP-PNP promotes some Seylp-mediated fusion.

Next,we tested the effect of dimer mutations on Seylp activity. Mutation of L233 (equivalent to L257 in caSeylp showninFig.2A) drasticallyreduced the dimerization(Fig. S3 C),GTPase activity (Fig. S2 F),and fusion activity of scSeylp (Fig. $2 \textrm { E }$ and Fig. $\mathrm { S 4 ~ B }$ for reconstitution controls),whereas mutation of the correspondingL274 in ATL1 resulted in weaker defects in dimerization (Fig.S3 D).Deletion of 3HB-2 to 3HB-4 (residues 378-675)in the stalk domain(△3/4 stalk)of scSeylp,which abolishes most of the stalk interactions in the dimer and mimics the size of ATL1 (Fig. S1 C),strongly inhibited fusion activity (Fig.2 E). scSeylp was also inactive when 3HB-2wasretained but 3HB-3and-4(residues462-675) were truncated (△1/2 stalk; Fig.2 E). Conversely, the removal of a long loop (residues 613-636)within 3HB-4（△Loop) did not significantlyaffect fusion activity (Fig.2E).Nevertheless,all three mutations in the stalk domain had GTPase activity at wildtype levels (Fig. S2 G). These results suggest that the length of the stalk domain is important for fusion.

# Conformational change induced by $\mathbf { \mathbb { P } _ { i } }$ release

The structures suggest that Seylp retains its configuration during hydrolysis of the $\gamma$ -phosphate bond but undergoes at least two conformational changes upon $\mathrm { \mathrm { P _ { i } } }$ release: one in the active site and one involving repositioning of the stalk domain relative to the GTPase domain. In the $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ 0r GMP-PNP structure,switch1 and 2 wrap around the nucleotide (Fig.3 A). On the other hand,both loops are distant from the active site and partially disordered in the GDP structure (Fig.3A).These movements of switch1 and 2 are typical among GTPases and explain why the dimer is stable with GMP-PNP or $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ but not with GDP,as the switches are at the dimerization interface (Figs. $2 \mathrm { A }$ and $3 \mathrm { A }$ )

Absence of the $\boldsymbol { \gamma }$ -phosphate not only breaks the caSeylp dimer but appears to alter the relative positions of the GTPase and stalk domains (Fig.3B).When GMP-PNP or $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ is bound, the linker connecting the GTPase domain and stalk domain attaches to the $\propto 7$ of the other protomer.Major contacts includeL312andL318fromonemolecule,andV319andF322 from the other molecule (Fig.3 C).In addition, Q315 formsahomotypic interaction,and D3O9 from the linker makes salt bridges to K323 and R376 of the other protomer (Fig. $3 \mathrm { C }$ ).In the GDP state, $\alpha 7$ docks to α6 of the same Seylp molecule using mostly the same set of residues as in the GMP-PNP or $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ state. However,V319 and F322 engage M295 in α6,Q315 hydrogen bonds with Q3O3 and R299,and binding occurs between K323 and D291,and R376 and the carbonyl oxygen of A52 (Fig. 3 D).

A cross-linking assay was used to confirm the conformational change inferred from the structures.3HB-1 of one cytSeylp molecule and α6 of the other molecule came in proximity to one another in the presence of GMP-PNP or $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ but not GDP or in the absence of nucleotide.As expected,a crosslinked dimer formed when the scSeylp mutant L297C/V298C (L318C/V319C in caSeylp; see Fig. $3 \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ for positions of the mutations) was treated with diamide to induce disulfide bridge formation (Fig.3E,lanes 4 and 5 vs.2 and 3).Cross-linked products were not observed when the scSeylp mutant M274C/ V298C(M295C/V319C in caSeylp) was tested or when the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol was added (Fig.3E).Furthermore,as expected from the $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ and GMP-PNP structure in which residue N4O7 of one caSeylp molecule comes in proximity to K467 of the other caSeylp molecule (Fig.2 B),cysteines introduced at these positions formed a disulfide bridge (Fig.3F,lanes 4and 5).Finally,consistent with the AUC results,more dimers were formed with GMP-PNPthan GDP/ $\mathrm { A l F } _ { 4 } { } ^ { - }$ (Fig.3,E and F,compare lanes4 and 5).

To directly assess whether the conformational changes are critical for fusion,we performed in vitro fusion assays.Mutation M274A in scSeylp (as M295A in caSeylp),which is predicted to play no role in dimerization and localizes to the

GTPase-stalk interface in the GDP state,had reduced fusion activity comparable to the level of wild-type protein with GMPPNP(Fig.3G).Similarly,mutantL297A in scSeylp (asL318A in caSeylp),which appears to be important for dimerization but not stabilization of the GDP state,was less effective in fusion (Fig. $3 \mathrm { H }$ ).Finally, substitution of V298 (as V319 in caSeylp) with ala,which disrupts GTPase-stalk interactions in both dimeric and monomeric conformations,drastically affected the fusion activity (Fig. 3 H). Collectively, these data strongly support the conformations observed in the structures.

# Analysis of Sey1p in mammalian cells

To analyze the function of Seylp,we tested whether it can replace ATLs in mammalian cells.We used siRNA to deplete the major ATL proteins,mainly ATL2 and ATL3 in COS-7 cells,and visualized the ER morphologyusing calreticulin as a marker. Consistent with previous results (Hu et al.,2009;Wu et al.,2015),when ATLs were knocked down in COS-7 cells (Fig.4 A),the ER appeared as unbranched morphology in a majority of cells (Fig. 4,B and D),indicating defects in ER fusion.As expected,wild-type human ATL1,but not ATL1 with a mutation in the P-loop (K8OA), effciently restored the ER network in double-depleted cells (Fig. 4, Cand D; andFig.S5 A).When scSeylp was expressed at a comparable level, most cells had normal ER morphology (Fig.4, C and D;and Fig. S5 A),suggesting that Seylp and human ATL1 are equally active in maintaining the ER network.K5OA (P-loop mutant),L233A (dimer interface mutant),L297A,V298A (both GTPase-stalk interface mutants),and△1/2stalk(stalkmutant) all failed to rescue the defects in ER morphology (Fig. $4 \mathrm { D }$ and see Fig. $_ { \textrm { S 5 B } }$ for expression levels).Mutation M274A largely reduced thepercentage of abnormalER(Fig.4D),likely because it only affects the stabilization of the GDP-bound conformation and not Seylp dimerization. These results confirm that Seylp plays an important role in in the maintenance of ER morphology.

To test whether caSeylp and scSeylp have similar functions in cells,we expressed caSeylp in ATL-depleted COS-7 cells and monitored ER morphology (Fig. 4 C).As expected and similar to scSeylp,wild-type caSeylp but notGTP-binding defective mutant K71A successfully replaced ATLs in mammalian cells (Fig. 4, C and D).To further analyze the function of caSeylp,we expressed caSeylp under the control of the endogenous SEY1 promoter in a CEN vector (Fig. S5 C) in yeast cells lacking Seylp and Yoplp, an ER tubule-forming protein,and exhibiting abnormal ER morphology.caSeylp was mostly capable of substituting scSeylp in the maintenance of ER morphology (Fig. S5 D).These results confirmed that caSeylp is a functional homologue of scSeylp.

Seylp protein has been observed to be concentrated in punctae along the ER tubules in yeast cells,mainly at the threeway junctions of the tubules (Hu etal.,2Oo9).The localization of scSeylp in COS-7 cells appears to be similar to that of yeast cells, regardless of whether ATLs are present (Figs.4C and 5A).Punctae were also seen when caSey1p was expressed in ATL-depleted COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, scSeylp mutant with defective dimerization and fusion lost its punctate pattern (L233A;

Fig.5B).ATL1 mainlydistributed evenlyalong the ERtubules (Fig.5 C),but ATL3 formed punctae like Seylp (Fig.5D). Given that ATL3 was recently reported to be slower than ATL1 (Hu et al.,2015),GTPases with relatively low hydrolysis activity should tend to form punctae in cells.To test this possibility,we mutated the Arg finger of ATL1 (R77) to Ala.It has been reported that ATL1R77A can still bind to GTP and form dimers,but GTP hydrolysis occurs much more slowly (Byrnes et al.,2O13).We found that ATL1 R77A formed punctae in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5E). The same results were obtained when these proteins were expressed in ATL-depleted cells (Fig.S5 B).These data suggest that punctae formation is dependent on GTPase activity.

# Discussion

Our results suggest how Seylp causes homotypic fusion of ER membranes (Fig.6A).First, two Seylp molecules in different membranes bind GTP and form a dimer, thereby tethering the membranes together. It is possible that the stalk domains in the dimer do not associate initially but eventuallyreach the stable side-by-side conformation.To efficiently juxtapose the two membranes,we speculate that the Seylp dimer does not come in between the membrane but rather sits on the orbit of two closely attached membrane regions with its GTPase domains pointing awayfrom the tethered area.Flattened,closely spaced membranes were previously captured by cryo-EM during membrane tethering mediated byATL or SNAREs (Diao etal.,2O12; Hernandez et al.,2012;Saini etal.,2O14).Multiple dimers may self-associate, perhaps through oligomerization of their TM regions and form aring to stabilize the tethered state,during which time the two membranes beginto fuse.GTPhydrolysis and $\mathrm { \Delta P _ { i } }$ release causes a conformational change,probably triggered by changes in the switch1 region that is part of the GTPase domain dimer interface, and the switch 2 region that propagates at the interaction surface between the GTPase domain of one Seylp molecule and the linkerand stalk domain of the other.The GTPase domain would then be released and move freely until docking to its own stalk domain,resulting in disruption of the Seylp dimer.Regardless of whether the membrane merging occurs before the monomerization of Seylp,these molecules would start a new fusion attempt by searching for a dimer partner on opposing membranes.

Surprisingly,we observed membrane fusion by Seylp even with GMP-PNP,indicating that fusion can occur without GTP hydrolysis.However,most of the Seylp dimers formed with GMP-PNP would be on the same membrane,i.e., cis-dimer,and are futile.Fusion is much more efficient when GTP is added,as GTP hydrolysis would allow Seylp cycling between dimer and monomer states.Consequently,more Seylp monomers would be available for trans-interactionsbetween different membranes. Such competition between cis- and trans-interactions has also been recently reported for ATL (Liu et al.,2015).

Seylp-and ATL-mediated fusion differs in that the power stroke occursat different steps of the GTP cycle.Stable trans-dimers of ATL(in form 3) are in a crossover configuration and would not be possible without GTP hydrolysis (Fig.6 B). To achieve the tethered state,ATL molecules from apposing membranes have to bind GTP and dimerize into form 2 first; the two GTPase domains can then rotate and recapture the 3HBs from the pairing molecule to adopt form 3.The GTP-bound ATL dimer may switch between the two conformations until GTP hydrolysis drives the equilibrium toward form 3.Consistent with these models,ATL dimer is most stable when in complex with $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ ,whereas Seylp dimer is strongest with GMPPNP. Such a difference would not be explained by the structures but is likely determined by residues that sense the subtle change in distance between $\beta \mathrm { - }$ and $\boldsymbol { \gamma }$ -phosphate.

The formation of punctae at the three-way junctions or alongER tubules is seen in some,but notall,GTPase-based ER fusogens.Our results suggest that the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis play a role in punctae formation.Slow GTPases,such as Seylp and ATL3,are prone to clustering.However, mutants with further reduced activity,which do not sustain fusion,will lose the punctate pattern and become evenly distributed on the ER membrane. One scenario would be that effective fusion requires the simultaneous participation of several GTPase molecules. Alternatively, slow hydrolysis would prolong the existence of a tethered complex,allowing the observation of punctae.

The proposed mechanism reveals that homotypic membrane fusion could be achieved by different approaches in Seylp and ATL but with a similar paradigm. Some of the mechanism could apply to RHD3 and its homologues in the fusion ofplant ER membranes,and to mitofusin/Fzolp (Hermann et al.,1998;Chen et al.,20o3),another member of the dynamin family,in the fusion of mitochondrial outermembranes.Three point mutations were previously identified in RHD3(Wang et al.,1997).Based on sequence alignment with caSeylp,I134T andD185N would reside near the GTPase dimer interface,and A575V would be placed in the hydrophobic core of 3HB-4 (Fig.S1 D).The localization of these mutations confirms that dimerization of the GTPase domain and integrity of the stalk domain is critical for these dynamin-like proteins.

# Materials and methods

# Constructs,strains,and antibodies

The N-terminal cytosolic domains of $C$ 、albicans Seylp (residues 1-692),codon-optimized S. cerevisiae Seylp (residue 1-680),or hsATL1 (residues 18-447)were inserted into the NheI-XhoI sites ofpET-28a (EMDMillipore),which includesa thrombin-cleavable, N-terminal 6xHis-tag.For fusion assay,codon-optimized full-length scSeylp and full-length dmATL were cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pGEX6p-1 vector witha GST tag followed bya PreScission protease digestion site at the N terminus.For mammalian expression, Myc-scSeylp,Myc-caSeylp,or Myc-hsATL1 wasPCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA4/TO(Invitrogen) byKpnI-BamHI,BamHI-Xhol, orKpnI-Xhol sites.Myc-hsATL3 wasPCR amplified andcloned into pGW1.For endogenous level expression of scSeylp and caSeylp in yeast cells,the coding region of scSeylp and caSeylp plus an N-terminal HA tag and 3Oo bp upstream and downstream sequences of scSEY1 wasamplified and inserted into the KpnI-NotI site of pRS316 (a URA/CEN plasmid).The plasmid pJK59,encoding Sec63-GFP was used to visualize ER morphology.All point mutations were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The truncations (△3/4 stalk,deletion of residues 378-675 in scSeylp;△1/2 stalk,deletion of 462-675;△Loop,deletion of 613- 636)were generated using overlap PCR primers.All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

The strain JHY4 (BY4741 sey1△::kanMX4 yop1△::HIS3MX6; Hu et al.,2Oo9) was used to visualize ER morphology.Mouse anti-Myc and rabbit anti-Calreticulin antibodies were purchased from Abcam, and mouse anti-HA and mouse anti-phosphoglycerate kinase antibodieswere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

# Protein expression and purification

The cyt-caSeylp,cyt-scSeylp,and cyt-hsATL1 constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3),and cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani media at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to an OD600 of 0.6.Protein expression was induced by the addition of $0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ IPTG for $2 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Cells were harvested,resuspended in lysis buffer ( $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, $\mathrm { p H } 8 . 0$ $1 5 0 \mathrm { m M N a C l }$ $4 \mathrm { m M } \mathrm { M g } { \mathrm { C l } _ { 2 } }$ ,and $2 0 \mathrm { m M }$ imidazole),and lysed byan ultra-high pressure cell disrupter (JN-3OOO PLUS;JNBIO). The lysate was centrifuged at $1 6 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $^ { \textrm { 1 h } }$ ,and the supernatant was collected. The protein was isolated by Ni-NTA chromatography(GE Healthcare)and further purified by ion-exchange chromatography (Resourse-Q orHiTrap Q;GE Healthcare) and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex-2Oo;GE Healthcare).For crystallization,corresponding nucleotides at $2 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ were included in the gel filtration buffer(Yan et al.,2011;Chen et al.,2012).

For expression of selenomethionine-substituted (Se-Met) Seylp, cells were grown in M9 medium at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to an OD600 of 0.6.Solid amino acid supplements (5O mg/literLys,Thr,andPhe; 25mg/literLeu,Ile,and Val; 3O mg/liter Se-Met) were added to the medium before induction.The Se-Met protein was purified by the same procedure as the native protein.

Full-length dmATL or scSeylp were expressed and purified with a GST tag.The proteins were solubilized and isolated in Triton X-100 (Anatrace),and the GST tag was cleaved before reconstitution (Bian et al., 2011; Anwar et al., 2012).

# X-ray crystallography

All native and selenomethionine-substituted proteins were concentrated to $8 \mathrm { \ m g / m l }$ and crystallized by vapor diffusion methods at $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Crystalsof Seylp with $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ were grown within days in $1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ lithium sulfate monohydrate, $8 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, $\mathrm { p H } 8 . 5$ $20 \%$ (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ ammonium acetate, $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, $\mathrm { p H } 5 . 6$ $6 \%$ (wt/vol) PEG 4000,and $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ spermidine.Crystals of Seylp with GMPPNP appeared around $6 \textup { d }$ in $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ DL-malic acid, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0$ ， $1 6 \%$ (wt/vol) PEG 3350, $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ bicine, $\mathrm { \ p H \ 9 . 0 }$ ， $4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m M }$ magnesium chloride hexahydrate,and $6 \%$ D- $\cdot ( + )$ -trehalose dihydrate.Crystals of Seylp with GDP complex appeared around $2 ~ \mathrm { m o }$ in $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, pH 8.5, $1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, $4 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ GDP,and $2 1 \%$ (wt/vol) PEG 3350.

All crystals were transferred to a cryo-protectant solution (4 M sodium formate) before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage.The native data for Seylp with GDP was collected in a beamline BL17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (China). Other data were collected at $1 0 0 \mathrm { K }$ using a charge-coupled device detector(Q27O;Area Detector Systems Corporation) on beamline BL1A at Photon Factory (Japan).All data were processed and scaled using HKL20o0 package 24 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997).

The structure of Seylp with $\mathrm { { G D P / A l F _ { 4 } } ^ { - } }$ was solved by single anomalous diffraction of Se-Met using SHELX (Schneider and Sheldrick,2Oo2).An initial model was built by the program coot and used in molecular replacement to determine the structure of Seylp with GDP or GMP-PNP (Emsley and Cowtan,2004). For model refinement,the Phenix refinement program (phenix.refine)was used (Afonine et al.,2O12).Interface and surface area Was calculated using PDBePISA.

# AUC

Purified cyt-scSeylp and cyt-hsATL1 were used for AUC ina buffer containing $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, $\mathrm { p H } ~ 8 . 0$ ，300 mMNaCl,and $5 \ \mathrm { m M \ M g C l _ { 2 } }$ Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a proteomeLab XL-1 Protein Characterization System (Beckman Coulter). $2 \mathrm { m M }$ GDP,2 mMGMP-PNP,or $2 \mathrm { m M G D P / 6 \ m M A l C l _ { 3 } / 3 0 \ m M N a F }$ wereadded to $4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ protein before centrifugation.All interference datawere collected at a speed of $4 2 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ in a rotor $\mathrm { \langle A n - 6 0 T i }$ ；Beckman Coulter) and analyzed by the program SEDFIT in terms of a continuous c(s) distribution.In sedimentation equilibrium experiments,the proteins were prepared at three different concentrations(O.2,O.3,and $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l }$ ).Interference data were collected at three different speeds (8,000,12,000,and $1 5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ for cytATL1;6,400,9,600,and12,000 rpm for cytSeylp) in a $\mathrm { A n } { - } 6 0 \ \mathrm { T i }$ rotor at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and analyzed by SEDPHAT using a model of monomer-dimer self-association.

# Cross-linking assays

$1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { M } }$ wild-type or mutant cytSeylp protein in $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Hepes, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 4$ $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m M \ N a C l }$ ,and5mM $\mathrm { M g C l } _ { 2 }$ with or without $1 \ \mathrm { m M }$ GDP, $1 \ \mathrm { m M }$ GMP-PNP, or $1 \mathrm { m M G D P / 3 \ m M A l C l _ { 3 } / 1 5 \ m M N a F }$ was incubated with $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ diamide at room temperature for 30 min $5 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { M } }$ $N \mathrm { . }$ -ethylmaleimide was used to quench the reactions.The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.

# Fusion assays

Lipid-mixingassays were performed as previously described (Bian et al.,2011).In brief,lipids were dried down to a film,hydrated with A100 buffer ( $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Hepes,pH7.4,100 mM KCl,1 mM2-mercaptoethanol,and $10 \%$ glycerol),and extruded through polycarbonate filters with a pore size of $1 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .Proteins were reconstituted at a protein/ lipid molar ratio of1:2OO,except dmATL,which was reconstituted at a ratio of1:1,OoO (Fig. S4 C).The flotation of proteoliposomes was done on a sucrose gradient to determine the reconstitution efficiency. $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ proteoliposomes was mixed with $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ of $1 . 9 { \bf M }$ sucrose and overlaid with $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of $1 . 2 5 \mathrm { M }$ sucrose and $3 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ of $0 . 2 5 { \mathrm { M } } { }$ sucrose (all sucrose solutions were in $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Hepes, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 4$ and $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m M \ K C l } ) ,$ 二 After centrifugation at $1 7 4 { , } 0 0 0 g$ for $7 5 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a rotor (TLS55;Beckman Coulter),the gradient was fractionated into five fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.Donor and acceptor liposomes were added ata 1:3 ratio.The initial NBD fluorescence was set to zero,and the maximum fluorescence was determined after addition of dodecyl maltoside.

# Visual tethering/fusion assays

Full-length wild-type scSetylp was reconstituted into preformed liposomeswithRhodamine-DPPE(1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) or Oregon green-DPPE(Invitrogen) in the same way as described in the methods of Fusion assays.The vesicles were mixed 1:1 in a reaction buffer containing 5 mM $\mathrm { M g C l } _ { 2 }$ Differentnucleotides were added and the samples diluted1:1OO in reaction buffer or buffer with $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EDTA. ${ 5 \mu \mathrm { l } }$ samples were spotted onto a glass coverslip and visualized by confocal microscopy. Oregon green and Rhodamine dyes were excited with 488- and $5 6 1 \mathrm { - n m }$ lasers(100 $\mathrm { m W }$ ),and their emissions selected with 53O/40-and $6 2 0 / 5 0 \mathrm { - n m }$ filters, respectively. All images were captured under room temperature on a basic stand confocal microscope(AxioObsever Z1;Carl Zeiss) with a $6 3 { \times } / 1 . 4 0$ numerical aperture Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective lens using ZEN2O12 software (Carl Zeiss). Changes were made linearly across the entire image using Photoshop (Adobe).

# GTPase activity assays

GTPase activity assays were performed with the phosphate assay kit (Enzchek;Invitrogen).Reactions were performed in a $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ volume with $1 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ wild-type or mutant protein as indicated by the addition of $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ GTP.The absorbance at $3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ was measured every minute over $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ using a micro-plate reader (Synergy 4；BioTek). The rate of phosphate release was calculated based ona standard curve.

# Mammalian cellculture,transfections,and microscopy

COS-7 cells were maintained at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with $5 \%$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in DMEM containing $10 \%$ fetal bovine serum and passaged every $2 { - } 3 \mathrm { ~ d ~ }$ For siRNA transfections, COS-7 cells were plated at $50 \%$ confluency and transfected the next morning with $1 3 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ of each siRNA oligonucleotide duplex using RNAiMAX(Invitrogen) for $6 \mathrm { h }$ Cells were then scraped for immunoblot analysis or fixed for immunofluorescence analysis $4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ after transfection. Specific siRNA oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) for ATL2 were targeted against the following sequences: $5 ^ { \prime }$ GGAGCUAUCCUUAUGAACAUUCAUA $3 ^ { \prime }$ and thatforATL3were $5 ^ { \prime }$ -GGUUAGAGAUUGGAGUUUCCCUUAU-3'.
