# Mutation in the gene encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 4 (CitACS4) led to andromonoecy in watermelon

Summary Although it has been reported previously that ethylene plays a critical role in sex determination in cucurbit species, how the andromonoecy that carries both the male and hermaphroditic flowers is determined in watermelon is still unknown. Here we showed that the watermelon gene 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 4 (CitACS4),expressed specifically in carpel primor dia, determines the andromonoecy in watermelon. Among four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and one InDel identified in the coding region of CitACS4，the ${ \mathsf { C } } 3 6 4 { \mathsf { W } }$ mutation located in the conserved box 6 was cosegregated with andromonoecy. Enzymatic analyses showed that the $\mathsf { C 3 6 4 W }$ mutation caused a reduced activity in CitACS4.We believe that the reduced CitACS4 activity may hamper the programmed cell death in stamen primordia， leading to the formation of hermaphroditic flowers.

It has been reported that 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic synthase (ACS),a key enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis,is important for sex determination in several Cucurbitaceae species (Boualem et al. 2oo8,2oo9). In cucumber and melon, mutations that cause reduced ACS activities lead to andromonoecy (Boualem et al. 20o8， 20o9). Modern watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) varieties have three common sex forms: monoecious (carrying both male and female flowers)，andromonoecious (carrying both male and hermaphroditic flowers） and gynoecious (carrying female flowers only) (Ji et al.2o15)，and a recessive locus (a) is associated with the andromonoecy (Ji et al.2o15). Eight ACS genes，Cla014652 (CitACS1)， Cla014057 (CitACS2)， Cla006634 (CitACS3),Cla011230 (CitACS4), Cla000483 (CitACS9), Cla011522 (CitACS10),Cla022653 (CitACS11),and Cla006245 (CitACS12) are present in the watermelon genome (Guo et al. 2o13,2015). Four genes in ACS family，CitACS1，2，3，and 4，were speculated to associate with sex determination (SalmanMinkov et al. 20o8;Prothro et al. 2013;Guo et al. 2015). Homology analyses showed that the CitACS4 shared $94 \%$ sequence identity with the CmACS-7 in melon at the amino acid level (Figure 1A). The 1,72o bp genomic region of CitACS4,containing three exons and two introns (Figure S1), encodes a polypeptide with 444 amino acids (Figure 1A). Therefore,it has been proposed previously that CitACS4 in watermelon is the ortholog of CmAcS-7,and might be the candidate gene for the a locus in watermelon (Prothro et al.2o13).To address this possibility,we used polymerase chain reaction (PcR) to amplify the genomic sequences of CitACS4 from 25 watermelon germplasm collections with different sex forms:19 monoecious,one gynoecious and five andromonoecious (Figure S1).This study enabled us to identify in total five polymorphic sites with either SNPs or insertion-deletion (InDels）in CitACS4.Among them，only the SNP of G1477C was co-segregated with the andromonoecy (Figure S1). The mutation caused a cysteine (C) to tryptophan (W） substitution at the residue $3 6 4$ (named C364W; Figure 1A).We constructed a $\mathsf { F } _ { 2 }$ population from a cross between the andromonoecious line AKKZW (aa) and the monoecious line XHB (AA) to test if the C364W substitution was associated with andromonoecy.A dCAPs marker dCAPs_FspBl was designed to detect the polymorphism of G1477C.Genotypic analyses in a population of 440 $\mathsf { F } _ { 2 }$ progenies showed that all 1o7 andromonoecious plants obtained were co-segregated with the aa genotype of dCAPs_FspBl,while none of the remaining 333 progenies showed andromonoecy，suggesting a tight link of the $\mathsf { C } 3 6 4 \mathsf { W }$ substitution with the a locus (Figure S2).ACS protein has 12 conserved boxes (Rottmann et al.1991)，and the $\mathsf { C } 3 6 4 \mathsf { W }$ is located in the box 6 (Figure 1B). It has been showed previously that the G33C， P209S and S399L mutations in cucumber ACS and the A57V mutation in melon ACS exhibited reduced ACS enzymatic activities,and plants carrying these mutations showed andromonoecy in flowers (Boualem et al.20o8,2009).

To determine if the $\mathsf { C } 3 6 4 \mathsf { W }$ mutation had compromised the enzymatic activity of ACS,three constructs, His6-CitACS4, His6-CitACS4C364W and His6-CmACS-7,were made and transformed into Escherichia coli.Fusion proteins were affinitypurified using Ni columns.The ACS enzymatic activity was measured using abuffer containing $1 0 \mu M$ pyridoxal $5 ^ { \prime }$ -phosphate（PLP）and $2 0 0 \mu { M }$ S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (Boualem et al.2oo8,2oo9). Results obtained showed that the ACS activity of His6-CitACS4 Was similar to that of His6-CmACS-7, while the ACS activity of His6-CitACS4C364W was significantly reduced, suggesting that the C364W mutation hascompromised the enzymatic activity of CitACS4 (Figure 2A). The $3 -$ dimensional modeling for CitACS4,which referred to the LeACS8 structure in tomato (Huai et al.2001), showed that the C364 residue is located in the $\alpha$ -carboxylate backbone (Figure S3A,B). In this model, the cysteine residue possesses a mercapto group that can potentially form a disulfide bond to maintain the protein stability (Figure $\mathsf { S 3 B } _ { . } ^ { \cdot }$ ） The C364W substitution may have disrupted the stability of CitACS4，and subsequently damaged the activity of the enzyme.

To examine the expression pattern of CitACS4,total RNA was extracted from different parts of watermelon plant. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed and results showed that CitACS4 was expressed specifically in female and Herhap flowers (Figure 2B). According to the stages defined for flower development in cucumber (Bai et al.2oo4), CitACS4

was expressed primarily instage 6 femaleand hermaphroditic flower buds,and lower levels of expression were detected in stage 10 and 14 flowers (Figures S4，S5).RNA in situ hybridization analysis revealed that CitACS4 was expressed specificallyin the carpel primordiaof femaleand hermaphroditic flower buds at stages 5 and 6 (Figure 2C,D),while no expression was detected in male flower buds (Figure 2E).The CitACS4 expression pattern is similar to that of the CsACS2 in cucumber,and the CmACS-7 in melon (Boualem et al. 2008, 2009).All primers used in this study were listed in Table S1.

The production of ethylene in female floral primordia, mediated by the ACS activity，triggers the programmed cell death (PCD) in male floral organs (Bai et al.2o04). In this study we showed that the andromonoecious sex form in watermelon was caused by a recessive mutation in CitACS4.The compromised enzymatic activity of CitACS4 inandromonoeciouswatermelonvarietiesmayhave caused a reduced ethylene production in carpel primordia, leading to the formation of flowers with both male and female organs.This result may potentially be used in breeding and genetic improvement of watermelon in the future.
