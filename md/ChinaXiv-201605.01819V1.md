Abstract The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) will begin its early-science operations during 2O16. Drift-scan pulsar surveys wil be carried out during this period using an ultra-wide-band receiver system (covering $\sim 2 7 0$ to $1 6 2 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ ).We describe a method for accounting for the changes in the telescope beam shape and the pulsar parameters when searching for pulsars over such a wide bandwidth.We applied this method to simulated data sets of pulsars in globular clusters that are visible to FASTand found that a representative observation would have a sensitivity of $\sim 4 0 \mu \mathrm { J } \$ v. Our results showed that a single drift-scan (lasting less than a minute) is likely to find at least one pulsar for observations of four globular clusters. Repeated observations willincrease the likely number of detections. We found that pulsars in ${ \sim } 1 6$ clusters are likely to be found if the data from 1OO drift-scan observations of each cluster are incoherently combined.

Key words:pulsars— drift-scan pulsar surveys — globular clusters

# 1INTRODUCTION

The ATNF pulsar cataloguel (e.g. Manchester et al. 2005） lists more than 2400 currently known radio pulsars.Even though the majority of these pulsars reside in our Galaxy,28 pulsars have been discovered in the Magellanic Clouds and more than 144 pulsars are associated with globular clusters (GCs).Most pulsar surveys belong to one of three categories: “large-area pointed surveys"(e.g. Manchester et al. 2001) in which an extensive region of the sky is surveyed by making many individual observations,“drift-scan surveys”(e.g. Hessels et al. 2008; Deneva et al. 2O13) in which the telescope remains pointing in one direction and surveys any sky that passes through the beam and “targeted surveys”(e.g. Manchester et al. 1982) in which the telescope observes objects that are likely to contain pulsars such as supernova remnants, high-energy sources,globular clusters,and/or nearby galaxies.

The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) is expected to revolutionise pulsar astronomy (e.g. Nan et al. 2011). It willbe the World's largest single dish radio telescope and willbe equipped with a suite of modern receivers. FAST should provide the highest quality pulsar profile observations and pulsar timing data, which willhave profound impacts on various fields of astrophysics.For instance,Hobbs et al. (2014) described how FAST observations willbe used in the search for ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves.

FAST willalso discover new pulsars.Smits et al. (2OO9) considered two surveys with FAST. The first was a search for pulsars in the Galactic plane.They assumed eight hours of observing per day over 2Oo days. Such a survey, using a l9-beam focal plane feed-horn array operating in the $2 0 \mathrm { c m }$ band,was expected to discover ${ \sim } 5 2 0 0$ currently unknown pulsars in the Galactic plane,including $\sim 4 6 0$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Smits et al. (2O09) also considered a search for extra-Galactic pulsars in M31 and M33. They showed that 470 hours of observing with a 19-beam receiver would lead to between 50 and 100 new pulsar discoveries. Yue et al. (2O13) considered a drift-scan pulsar survey using a low frequency ( ${ \sim } 4 0 0 \mathrm { M H z } )$ 7- beam receiver system. Such a survey was expected to discover $\sim 1 5 0 0$ new normal pulsars and about 200 MSPs.

The multibeam receiver systems described above will not be available for the very first science observations with FAST(expected late in 2016). Instead,the first observations will be made using a single beam, ultra-wide bandwidth receiver system with a frequency range between 27O and $1 6 2 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ and a receiver temperature of ${ \sim } 3 5 \mathrm { K }$ across most of the band. As described in this paper, carrying out a pulsar survey with such a large bandwidth provides many opportunities, but also leads to many challenges.

Early FAST observations will be carried out as drift-scans because of the need to minimise (for, at least,the first few months of observations) attrition of the actuator system and expected radio-frequencyinterference (RFI) from moving the hydraulic systems. Until these issues have been properly dealt with, observers willbe required to move the telescope pointing position to a specific part of the sky and then let the sky drift through the beam.As this is not a common observing mode and was not considered in the earlier publications relating to FAST surveys,it is now essential that we determine how best to carry out a drift-scan survey with an ultra-wide-band receiver system and to determine the expected number of pulsar discoveries that will be made during this early science period.The results from our analysis are presented in this paper. Even though our paper is based on an analysis of pulsar surveys using the FAST telescope, most major radio observatories are now using or commissioning ultra-wide-band receiver systems. Our analysis methods are applicable to any wide-bandwidth pulsar survey.

In this paper,we first describe a new method to optimise the detectability of a pulsed signal in a widebandwidth drift-scan survey. In Section 2, we describe the early science systems for FASTand demonstrate how FAST observations can be simulated.In Section 3, we discuss the expected survey sensitivity for early pulsar surveys with FAST and demonstrate how the sensitivity willincrease with multiple observations of the same source.In Section 4, we apply our results to searches for pulsars in globular clusters. We conclude in Section 5.

# 2WIDE-BAND,DRIFT-SCANSURVEYS

The sensitivity of any pulsar survey is a function of many factors including the receiver and sky background noise temperatures,the antenna gain,the observing bandwidth and observing time,the pulse period and its dispersion measure,the pulse duty cycle,data digitization effects,processing algorithms and interference levels. An estimate of the minimum detectable flux density for a pointed pulsar survey is given by (e.g. Lorimer & Kramer 2004)

$$
S _ { m i n } = \frac { \alpha \beta T _ { \mathrm { s y s } } } { G ( N _ { p } \Delta \nu T _ { \mathrm { i n t } } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } } \left( \frac { W } { P - W } \right) ^ { 1 / 2 } ,
$$

where $T _ { \mathrm { s y s } }$ is the system temperature, $G$ the telescope gain, $N _ { p }$ the number of summed polarisations, $\Delta \nu$ the observing bandwidth, $T _ { \mathrm { i n t } }$ the integration time, $P$ the pulse period and $W$ the pulse width. $\alpha$ is the minimum signal-to-noise ratio $( \mathrm { S } / \mathrm { N } )$ required to detect a source and $\beta$ is a factor that is close to unity and represents digitization and other processing effects.

For a drift-scan survey the $\mathsf { S } / \mathsf { N }$ of any individual source will be changing as a function of time.For a wide-band system many other parameters will be changing as a function of the observing frequency. These include parameters relating to the system and the noise levels,such as the receiver and sky temperatures, the intrinsic properties of the pulsar itself,such as its spectral index and pulse width,and phenomena caused by the interstellar medium, such as pulse dispersion, scintillation and scattering.

Pulsar survey data sets are recorded as follows:

- The signal from the telescope is channelised into $N _ { \mathrm { c h a n } }$ frequency channels evenly spaced through the observing band.   
- The signal in each channel is recorded (usually with 1,2,4 or 8 bit precision) with a sampling time of △T.   
- These data are archived. Each data file is then processed with a software pipeline that usually:   
- dedisperses the data in each frequency channel in a range of trial dispersion measures;   
·sums the frequency channels in the dedispersed time series to form a single time series for each trial dispersion measure;   
- Fourier transforms each trial time series and searches for significant periodicities;

-iterates the above steps to find optimized solutions for period and dispersion measure; - records these periodicities and the corresponding dispersion measures as possble pulsar candida

Throughout this paper we make use of the sIGPRoc software²(e.g. Lorimer et al. 2OO1). After Fourier transforming the dedispersed, single frequency time series,sIGPRoc forms an amplitude spectrum that has been normalised to give an rms of 1. The $\mathrm { { \cal S } / N }$ of a particular spectral channel is its normalised amplitude divided by the local root-mean-square value. sIGPRoc also attempts to improve the sensitivity to narrow pulses by a process known as harmonic summing. For each harmonic folding the root-mean-square values are scaled up by $\sqrt { 2 }$ The cut-off $\mathsf { S } / \mathsf { N }$ for a likely pulsar candidate depends upon the number of spectral chanels and the number of trial DMs.We discuss this for FAST later, but,for most of this paper, take a nominal cut-off value of $\alpha = 8$ =

# 2.1Early Science Systems for FAST

The methods described in this section can be applied to any telescope system. We focus here on the expected capabilities of FAST for its early science.The telescope size,position,and declination range are given in Table 1. The parameters for the ultra-wide band receiver system and the corresponding backend are also listed in the Table.It is unlikely that the entire band will be recorded.Even though the telescope site is relatively quiet, significant radio-frequency-interference (RFI) is known to exist around $9 0 0 \mathrm { { M H z } }$ Throughout this paper we therefore consider a low-band and a high-band that are divided by the known, strong RFI. These bands are parameterised in Table 2.

It will not be possble to centre the received signal frequency in the middle of band 1.Instead the backend will provide up to 8192 frequency channels over a band from O to $9 1 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ . The data between O and $2 7 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ and from ${ \sim } 8 5 0$ to $9 1 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ will be unusable. The former is due to the receiver cutoff and the latter the RFI environment.It is likely that the complete 91O to $1 8 2 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ band can be recorded with the full 8192 channels giving around 585O channels in the observing band between 970 and $1 6 2 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ . The pulsar and interstellar medium properties can significantly change across such wide bands.We therefore find it useful to divide each of these two observing bands into two sections.We thus have:

- band1a: from 270 to ${ 5 6 0 } \mathrm { M H z }$ with up to 2610 channels - band 1b: from 560 to 850 MHz with up to 2610 channels - band 2a: from 970 to 1295 MHz with up to 2925 channels -band 2b: from 1295 MHz to $1 6 2 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ with up to 2925 channels

# 2.2 Simulating a Wide-bandwidth,Drift-scan data set

In order to demonstrate and test our algorithms we simulated pulsar search data sets. Our code assumes a perfect pulse train with an unchanging pulse period and identical individual pulses3.Each pulse has, prior

to dispersion smearing or scattering effects,a Gaussian form and we assumed white, Gaussian radiometer noise.Our simulations account for the expected beam shape,the receiver noise and pulse dispersion.The sky temperature is modelled as:

$$
T _ { \mathrm { s k y } } ( f ) = T _ { 0 } \left( \frac { f } { f _ { 0 } } \right) ^ { - 2 . 6 } ,
$$

where $T _ { 0 }$ is the measured sky temperature in the specified sky position at a frequency of $f _ { 0 }$ ,estimated from an al-sky continuum survey(e.g. Haslam et al.1985). Over a smallband,or at high frequencies, the changes in $T _ { \mathrm { s k y } }$ over the band are usually negligible and ignored. However, for a wide-band survey it is necessary to account for the changing system temperature.The pulse flux density is assumed to follow a power law:

$$
S \left( f \right) = S _ { 0 } \left( \frac { f } { f _ { 0 } } \right) ^ { \gamma } ,
$$

where $S _ { 0 }$ is the flux density measured at frequency $f _ { 0 }$ . The spectral index, $\gamma$ ,can be modified by the user, but for this work is assumed to be $- 1 . 4$ (e.g. Bates et al. 2O13). The intrinsic pulse width is assumed to remain constant with frequency,but the measured pulse width will change because of scattring and dispersion smearing. Dispersion smearing is simulated by modeling the pulse shape with a much finer channel bandwidth than the user requested.The final output is summed over the fine channels to give the number of channels that was requested.The simulations produce either filterbank files or a single,dedispersed time series in the sIGPRoc filterbank format and therefore can be processed using the standard pulsar earch pipelines. The simulation software is available for download in a git repository hosted by https://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/simpulsetrain.

Fig.1 Simulated data sets in the two bands of the FAST early-science receiver. The left-hand panels show a simulated pulsar signal in the lowest observing band.The right-hand panels are the same pulsar in the highest observing band.The top panels show the pulsed signal strength (colour scale)as a function of pulse phase and time.Note that the lack of signal in the first second of data in the top-left panel is an artefact caused by the dedispersion (the dispersion time is ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { s }$ in this band. The bottom panels show the pulsed signal strength as a function of observing frequency across the band.The signal is dominated by inter-channel dispersion smearing and so scattering effects are not simulated for these figures.

# 2.3 Channel Weighted Dedespersion

For simplicity,we assume that the beam shape can be described as a sinc² function in which the first null occurs at $1 . 2 2 \lambda / D$ where $D$ is the effective telescope diameter and $\lambda$ is the observing wavelength.However, we note that the following analysis can be generalised to any beam shape.

The exact beam shape willdepend upon the receiver itself and tapering effects. We can write the receiver gain for a particular source as a function of the angular ofset between the pointing direction and the source and also on the observing frequency, $G ( \theta , \nu )$ . The time any particular source remains in the beam depends upon the cosine of the source declination and the beam shape. As an example we show, in Figure 1, a simulated data set. We simulated a pulsar with a pulse period of $5 \mathrm { m s }$ , a pulse width of $5 \%$ of the period, a dispersion measure of $3 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } \mathrm { p c }$ and a declination angle of $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ .For $T _ { 0 }$ and $f _ { 0 }$ in Equation 2 we chose 30K and $4 3 0 \mathrm { { M H z } }$ respectively. For this simulation we include the effect of dispersion smearing within each frequency channel, but do not simulate scatering.The left panels show simulated data in band la. The right-hand panels show simulated data in band 2b.In allpanels the individual pulses have been folded to produce an individual, pulse profile.The pulse intensity is indicated using the colour scale. In the top panels we indicate how the pulse intensity varies with time. Over the simulated 2O seconds the pulse remains almost constant in the lowest-band,but the beam shape is detectable in the high-frequency band.The bottom panels show the pulse profile as a function of observing frequency. The sky noise temperature increases as the observing frequency decreases whereas the pulsar's fux density increases.In the high-frequency band, very little change is detectable across the band.In the low-frequency band,the variation across the band becomes very noticeable because of the dispersion smearing.

For the FAST band 1a the drift time will be $\sim 6 8$ seconds (at $2 7 0 ~ \mathrm { M H z }$ ）whereas a source will drift through the beam in band 2b in only $\sim 1 1 \mathrm { s }$ (at $1 6 2 0 ~ \mathrm { M H z }$ ). If the observer chooses to observe for 60 s then the pulsed signal willbe undetectable during most of the observation in the high band, whereas if the observer only chooses to observe for $\sim 1 0 \mathrm { s }$ then the sensitivity at low frequencies will be reduced.Hence, if the observer wishes to maximise the survey sensitivity itis necessry to weight the data in each frequency channel by the beam shape for obtaining the frequency-summed,de-dispersed time series.For sample, $j$ ,in observing frequency channel $i$ , we can use the following, very simple, weighting

$$
X _ { i j } ^ { \prime } = X _ { i j } G ( \nu _ { i } , \theta _ { j } ) .
$$

Throughout this paper we assume that the drift-scan leads to variations in the telescope gain that follows4:

$$
G ( \nu _ { i } , \theta _ { j } ) = \left[ \frac { \sin \zeta _ { i j } } { \zeta _ { i j } } \right] ^ { 2 }
$$

where $\zeta _ { i j }$ is a function of time and observing frequency. This is set so that the first null in $G ( \nu _ { i } , \theta _ { j } )$ occurs at $1 . 2 2 \lambda / D$ where $\lambda = c / \nu _ { i }$ and $D$ is the telescope diameter.To convert this angular function into a drift time we scale by $\cos ( \delta )$ where $\delta$ is the declination of the source.

It would be straight-forward to update the sIGPRoc software to include this weighting during the dedispersion stage.However, we have included a dedispersion routine in our simulation software that can account for the weighting.The simulation software therefore outputs a file containing allthe flterbank channels without dedispersion and another, much smallr, file that has been weighted,dedispersed and summed across the frequency channels.To demonstrate the effctiveness of the weighting,we simulated a 2 minute drift-scan observation in band 2b,but for simplicity we only simulated 32 frequency channels.We simulated a pulsar with a period of $0 . 5 \mathrm { s }$ ,a width of $5 \%$ of the period and a dispersion measure of $3 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } \mathrm { p c }$ A pulse flux densityofO.2 mJyledtoasIGPROC $\mathrm { { } } S / \mathrm { { N } }$ of15.After weighting the dedispersed time series the $\mathrm { { \cal S } / N }$ value increased to 32. Of course, the improvement in $\mathsf { S } / \mathsf { N }$ depends upon the chosen band and the integration time.

# 3THE EXPECTEDSURVEY SENSITIVITYFOR EARLY PULSAR SURVEYS WITH FAST

In order to determine the expected survey sensitivity with FASTfor diferent types of pulsars, we simulated data sets in which each pulsar has a specific pulse period, $P$ ,a position in Galactic coordinates,and a dispersion measure.We assumed that the intrinsic pulse width $W = 0 . 0 5 P$ .We examined a wide range of pulse flux densities.For these datasets we provided the flux density for each simulated pulsar at $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ ， The actual flux density used was scaled,using Equation 3,to the relevant observing frequency.For each trial we produced a weighted,de-dispersed,frequency-summed time series.We then used the sIGPRoc software to measure the $\mathrm { { } } S / \mathrm { { N } }$ .We identified the flux density that gave a $\mathrm { { \cal S } / N }$ close to our nominal cutoff value of 8. This procedure was repeated for different periods and/or dispersion measures.

These simulations gave results that are similar(for smal periods) with analytic calculations based on Equation 1 (see also Zhang et al.2O15). However,for large pulse periods and short integration times the analytic equation breaks down5.In Figure 2 we show the expected survey sensitivity as a function of pulse period for different subbands and pulse periods.For the simulated band 1b results the sensitivity is given as the $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ sensitivity assuming a spectral index of -1.4.The blue dashed line is the scaled predicted sensitivity.The blue solid line is the predicted flux density sensitivity in the centre of the observing band $( 7 0 5 \mathrm { M H z } )$ ）without any scaling.Note that the simulation sensitivity is around a factor of 2 worse than the analytic prediction. This is not surprising. The simulation data is processed using actual search software and,in contrast with the analytic calculation,the simulation accounts for the changes in signal strength caused by the drift-scan and changes in the noise properties and pulse flux density over the observing band. The magenta (dashed), green (dotted) and yelow (dot-dashed) lines give the analytic flux density sensitivity for the centre of bands la,2a and 2b respectively. The solid lines theoretically extend to any large pulse period, but clearly a single pulse from a long-period pulsar would not be detectable using a periodicity pulsar search. We therefore cut the lines at a period corresponding to four pulses during the drift scan. For normal (i.e., non-millsecond pulsars) it is clear that the lowest frequency bands are the most sensitive to pulsars (away from the Galactic plane).For such pulsars surveys should be carred out in the low band with an observation time of ${ \sim } 6 0$ seconds.The lowest part of Band 1 is unsuitable for searching for millisecond pulsars because of the dispersion smearing across each frequency channel. The ideal observing strategy for milisecond pulsars is therefore to make use of the high part of band 1(e.g.,band 1b)or the low part of band 2 (e.g., band 2a) depending on an estimate of the periods and dispersion measures for the expected pulsars.

The open red circles in Figure 2 were obtained via simulation and are therefore affcted by the number of realisations carred out.In order to consider this further we show,in Figure 3,more details ofthe simulations used to determine the sensitivity for a pulse period of $0 . 1 \mathrm { s }$ .For a range of flux density values we create five simulated data sets. The $\mathrm { { \cal S } / N }$ of the pulsar as determined via sIGPRoc are shown as open circles (red after using our weighting and green for unweighted results).The average of these data points are shown using the triangle symbols (note for clarity the open circles are slightly offset from the actual flux value simulated).

![](images/2e34ace0f3173831d2d69f0fb566ef8d17e81084135de891597adc279118d26e.jpg)

Fig.2 The survey sensitivity for different observing bands assuming a pulsar with a dispersion measure of $2 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } \mathrm { p c }$ and a declination of $0 ^ { \circ }$ . The red circles give the survey sensitivity as obtained using our simulation software and the channel-weighted sigproc search pipeline in band 1b for a 3O s observation.The circles are direct measurements of the sensitivity whereas the red arrows indicate regions in which the simulated pulsar was undetectable at any flux density (and therefore represent lower limits to the true sensitivity). The blue solid line is the predicted, nonscaled flux density sensitivity in the centre of the 1b observing band. The magenta, green, and yellow lines give the analytic predictions for bands 1a, 2a and 2b respectively. The observation durations were 6O/3O/2O and 15s for the analytic determination in the four bands.The blue dashed line is the 1b observing band analytic sensitivity scaled to a frequency of $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { M H z }$

In the left-hand panel we show the results for simulations of $3 0 \mathrm { s }$ observations.In the right-hand panel we show the same,but for $6 0 \mathrm { s }$ observations. These results indicate,as expected,that the weighting becomes more important as the observing span increases.The exact value for the limiting flux density as shown in Figure 2 were obtained by determining the flux density value which leads to a weighted $\mathrm { { } } S / \mathrm { { N } }$ of 8.As shown in Figure 3 there is a small uncertainty on this value (typically $\textless 1 0 \mu \mathrm { J y }$ ）

Discussing the survey sensitivity is non-trivial as it depends on the band chosen,the pulse period,and the dispersion measure.The flux density results can also,if necessary, be scaled to the expected flux density at e.g., $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ assuming a given spectral index. However, it is clear from Figure 2 that we can expect a limiting sensitivity of $\sim 3 0$ to $6 0 \mu \mathrm { J y }$ . The drift-times will be short and therefore it is likely that many drift-scan observations willbe taken for the same source.Ignoring pulse intensity variations caused by e.g., scintilltion,the survey sensitivity will scale with the number of drift-scan observations of the particular source as $\sqrt { N _ { \mathrm { d r i f t } } }$ after incoherently stacking the power spectra.

# 4SEARCHINGFORPULSARSINGLOBULARCLUSTERS

As shown in the previous section, we can estimate the sensitivity of a FAST drift-scan survey in a particular observing band and for aparticular sky position. A drift-scan pointing directly upwards, or passing through a region of the Galactic plane may lead to the discovery of a few pulsars,but the FAST beam is narrow and unless prior information exists suggesting that a particular sky position is likely to contain a pulsar,a FAST drift-scan survey may require a very large amount of observing time before making a discovery6.

Fig.3 Signal-to-noise for a pulsar candidate as a function of flux density value for observations of length $3 0 \mathrm { s }$ (left panel) and $6 0 \mathrm { s }$ (right panel). The simulated pulsar has a pulse period of O.1 s. Five realisations are made for each simulation.The individual results are shown as open circles (red for the weighted algorithm and green is the unweighted algorithm). The vertical solid lines indicate the flux density value corresponding to $S / \mathrm { N } { = } 8$ .The vertical dashed line indicates the limiting flux density value presented in Figure 2.

For this paper we chose to examine the likelihood of pulsar discovery in globular clusters as such clusters are already known to contain relatively large numbers of pulsars, many of which are deemed “interesting”. For instance.many such pulsars are fast spinning,they are mostly in binary systems and it is possble that the first milisecond-pulsar-black-hole binary system willbe discovered in a globular cluster (e.g. Clausen et al.2014). Globular clusters are at known positions,can be observed with a single FAST observation and their distances/dispersion measures can be estimated from existing data.

The Milky Way Globular Clusters catalogue'contains 45 globular clusters that are observable by FAST. The number of potentially-detectable pulsars, $N _ { \mathrm { p s r } }$ , in any given globular cluster depends upon the properties ofthe cluster. Hui etal. (2O10)and Turk & Lorimer (2O13)showed that the numberof potentially detectable pulsars, $N _ { \mathrm { p s r } }$ , depends mainly upon the stellar interaction rate, $\Gamma$ , of the cluster:

$$
N _ { \mathrm { p s r } } \approx - 1 . 1 + 1 . 5 \log _ { 1 0 } \Gamma .
$$

The 4O globular clusters in the FAST sky that have measured $\Gamma$ valuesare tabulated in Table 3.The first five columns in the table provide the cluster name,right ascension and declination and Galactic coordinates. The“best” estimate of the dispersion measure (DM) of a pulsar in the cluster is given in column six. If a pulsar is already known in the cluster then this value is taken from the DMof that pulsar (or the mean value for a group of pulsars). If no pulsar is currently known then the Cordes & Lazio (2O02) electron density model is used to determine the DM in the direction of the cluster for the assumed distance (listed in column 7).The 8th column lists $\Gamma$ for each cluster. The number of known pulsars according to the ATNF pulsar catalogue, $N _ { \mathrm { k n o w n } }$ , and potential pulsars, $N _ { \mathrm { p s r } }$ ,as determined from Equation 6 are listed in the 9th and 10th columns respectively.

The number of pulsars that may actually be detected, $N _ { \mathrm { e x p e c t } }$ ,depends upon the sensitivity of the survey and the distance to the globular cluster. Turk & Lorimer(2O13) showed that

$$

$$

where $D$ is the cluster distance in kpc, $\mu = - 1 . 1$ $\sigma = 0 . 9$ and $S _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ is in the units of Jy scaled to $1 4 0 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ The prediction of $N _ { \mathrm { e x p e c t } }$ thus requires an estimate of $S _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ . Our simulations can be used to produce a prediction for $S _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ as a function of the pulse period for each cluster and assumed dispersion measure.However, the majorityof globular cluster pulsars have milisecond periods.We therefore assume a pulsar with a period of $1 0 \mathrm { m s }$ . The signal from such pulsars will be significantly smeared in band la and so we simply simulate the pulsar in band 1b. This allows us to estimate $S _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ accounting for the cluster position and dispersion measure. Of course, these calculations can be updated for e.g., much faster spinning pulsars (in which case the sensitivity willbe reduced)or for much slower-spinning pulsars in which case it would be possible to significantly increase $N _ { \mathrm { e x p e c t } }$ as a wider band would be usable.

$N _ { \mathrm { e x p e c t } }$ is listed in column 1 of the table.We emphasise that these predictions are only estimates, but it is likely that clusters with a large number of expected pulsars are better targets for earlyFAST observations than those clusters where the expected number of pulsars is zero.These results represent the likely number of pulsars detectable in a single drift-scan observation. Only four clusters contain a postulated pulsar that could be detected in a single observation. Because these drift-scan observations are short it will not be difficult to carry out repeated observations of the same cluster.If the telescope can be re-pointed relatively quickly to the cluster then it may be possble to keep the backend system running for multiple observations of the same cluster,allowing for a coherent analysis of the entire data set. However,it willnot be trivial to process such complex data sets.More realistically, it is likely that a single observation of a cluster willbe made,the backend recording system willthen be stopped and later (perhaps hours or days later another observation willbe made of the same cluster. We therefore calculated the number of incoherently added observations that would be necessary to discover around 1 new millisecond pulsar. These values are listed in the penultimate column of the Table.Equation 7 is a complex function that does not simply scale with the number of observations.In the last column of the Table we therefore also presented the number of FAST observations that would be required to detect, on average,three pulsars in each cluster9,for which the predicted number of pulsars is $\geq 3$ ）

Table 3 The $4 0 ~ \mathrm { G C s }$ in the FAST Sky（ $- 1 4 ^ { \circ } ~ \leq ~ D e c ~ \leq ~ + 6 6 ^ { \circ } )$ that were analysed in this paper. For each cluster we list the equatorial (RA, Dec.) and Galactic $( 1 , { \mathfrak { b } } )$ coordinates,the best estimate of the dispersion measure of pulsars in the cluster (DM),the distance to the cluster from the Sun (dis), the stellar encounter rate $( \Gamma )$ , the number of currently known pulsars in the cluster $( \mathrm { N _ { k n o w n } } )$ , the number that a single FAST observation is expected to detect $( \mathrm { N _ { e x p e c t } } )$ and the number of observations required to detect one $\mathrm { ( N _ { d r i f t \_ l 0 m s \_ l p s r } }$ ) or three $\mathrm { ( N _ { d r i f t \_ l 0 m s \_ 3 p s r } ) }$ pulsars.

\* determined from the mean DM of the known pulsars in the cluster $\dagger$ estimates from other properties of the cluster

We note that these estimates for the expected number of detections are pessimistic.For instance, we have assumed a $\mathsf { S } / \mathsf { N }$ cutoff of 8. This is a typical cutoff used for traditional pulsar surveys with long observations.The FAST observations will be relatively short and therefore it is possible that the $\mathrm { { } } S / \mathrm { { N } }$ cutoff could be reduced (hence,decreasing the minimum detectable sensitivity and increasing the number of expected discoveries). Analysing the results from multiple drift-scans willalso provide confidence in any candidate. For instance, if a low $\mathsf { S } / \mathsf { N }$ candidate was observed at the same period and dispersion measure in multiple drift-scans then it would likely be a pulsar.We note that for such short observations it will also not be necessary to carry out any acceleration searches and therefore these observations will be significantly more sensitive to pulsars in tight binary systems than previous surveys of globular clusters that typicall used long observations.

In this paper we have applied our drift-scan methodology to an example drift-scan survey of globular clusters using the FAST telescope. Ofcourse,there are many more types of source that could be observed. For instance,recent pulsar surveys of Fermi point sources have been extremely productive.Many of these newly discovered pulsars are in eclipsing systems and so it is necessry to carry out multiple observations (separated by many days) for their discovery. The experience gained from carrying out the FASTdrift-scan surveys described in this work will also benefit those studies as well.

# 5CONCLUSIONS

For this paper we have:

- developed a simulation code (which is publically available for download) to generate single pulse data sets.These data sets are similar to those that will be obtained by FAST in the near future.   
：demonstrated that the lowest part ( $2 7 0 \sim 5 6 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ of the early-science receiver band will not be useful for searching for fast millisecond pulsars.   
- presented a new channel-weighting scheme for accounting for drift-scans with wide-bandwidth receivers and demonstrated that the detectability of a pulsar with the SIGPROC software increases when using this scheme.   
- carried out trial pulsar searches on the simulated FAST drift-scan data to show that FAST will achieve be able to detect pulsars with a flux density of $\sim 4 0 \mu \mathrm { J y }$ This will scale down with the number of drifts s $\frac { 1 } { \sqrt { N _ { \mathrm { d r i f t } } } }$   
- examined expected detections in globular clusters based on empirical formulae of globular cluster pulsar populations and showed that FAST is likely to detect a few new pulsars in these clusters during the early science period.

We conclude that the FAST telescope willdiscover pulsars in the early science period, but caution that the 1000s of new discoveries predicted by e.g., Smits et al. (2O09) willrequire long-duration observations (and hence, the ability to track a source).We emphasise that pulsar searching has traditionally ben carried out with single dish telescopes with relatively smallfractional bandwidths.The advent of new telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array and FAST and new wide-band receivers for existing telescopes requires that search algorithms are updated in order to maximise the sensitivity of future surveys.
