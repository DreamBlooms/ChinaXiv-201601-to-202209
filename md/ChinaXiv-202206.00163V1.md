# Abstract

The behavior of nano-voids composed of vacancies (Vs) at grain boundaries (GBs) is fundamental to the design of the radiation tolerance of poly-crystalline metals (PCs) via GB engineering.In this study, based on differential evolution,a framework for determining the stable structure of GB nano-voids is developed. Combining the framework with multiscale simulations, we elucidate the vacancy-accumulation and GB void formation mechanism under irrdiation. A GB-structure dependent picture is revealed. At special coincidence-site-lattice (CSL) GBs of ∑5(310) and £5(210) with a medium V-GB binding energy, the V could be reemited from the GB and also has driving force to be clustered at the GB,developing particularly stable V-clusters from a linear configuration to a platelet and finally to three-dimensional void that has large strain fields in iron with smallbulk modulus and a bulk-void alike structure in the GB with large bulk modulus. A group of vacancies reconstruct their positions during the growth. The ripening is also mediated by the mobility of small V-clusters in addition to free Vs. General high-angle and low-angle GBs trap Vs efficiently, where V-clusters only align one-dimensionally or hardly nucleate. Based on the bonding among the vacancies and their neighboring atoms of a nano-void,we propose a high-accuracy predictive linear energetic model applied to the nano-void both at the iron/molybdenum/tungsten GBs and in the grain interior. The model captures the anisotropic feature of a nano-void and reproduces the oscilated vacancy energy level near a nano-void, showing distinct advantages over conventional continuum model and Wulff construction based energy model. Finally, the collctive behavior of multiple GBs plays a role in the GB void formation. The present work offers fundamental mechanistic insights to GB nano-void formation and growth and sets a key step towards GB-void prevention in PCs by reducing the fraction of special CSL-GBs.

# 1. Introduction

Nano-voids composed of vacancies (Vs) and their clusters $( \mathrm { V _ { n } s } )$ , one of natural native defects prevalent in materials under radiation [1-4],deformation [5],annealing[6],and high hydrogen pressure[7],playan important role in determining materials properties and performance, e.g. sweling [1-4,8,9], creep [10,11], impurity retention [12-15],and intergranular corrosion [16]. Notably,the interface e.g. grain boundaries (GBs) serving as sinks for defects appears to act as nucleation sites for vacancies to coalesce. The voids (or cavities containing a limited amount of gaseous impurities) have been observed to form preferentially along GBs and at triple junctions in poly-crystalline metals (PCs)[2-4,10-14,16,17]. Since the GB voids observed as early as 1954 [17], the thermodynamic models for vacancy accumulation and void growth at GBs have ben proposed [18,19]. However, the fundamental properties for the GB nano-void (e.g.its structure, energetics and kinetics) are still lacked except the properties of small $\mathrm { V _ { n } s }$ in bulk metals [20-25], which necessitate thorough studies on the behavior of GB nano-voids.   
Besides,the GB structure probably aects the nano-void formation mechanism in PCs [2-4,26,27] by providing diferent vacancy sink strengths and in-boundary properties of a nano-void. Experiments of the neutron and electron irrdiations to PC Fe-15Cr-15Ni stee and PNC316 stainlessteel at 749-775 K suggest that the void-denuded zone (VDZ) was formed only near a random GB, while voids were formed both in the grain interior and at coincidence site latice (CSL) GBs [3]. In electron irradiation experiments at $5 7 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ on Cu thin films [2], very few voids were observed around high-angle random GBs and low-angle GBs, while voids were preferentially observed to nucleate and grow in the regions with a high density of the coherent twin boundaries. The diference has been speculated to arise from the low sink strength of the low energy of the CSL-GBs [26]. On the other hand,however, the radiation response of NCs with high-density of GBs exhibits a scatered feature with respect to the GB character. For instance, VDZs were recently found to be independent of grain size, grain orientation,and GB misorientation angle in NC Fe [27]. Although the void size observed in these experiments is as large as tens of nanometers,the different large void formation

conditions are possibly related to the early period of the nano-void formation at the GBs with distinct structures.Therefore, the GB character complicates the GB nano-void behavior.

To obtain a fullpicture about a GB nano-void behavior, the first step is to find its stable structure, which acts as the basis of both the energetic and kinetic properties of the cluster. For this purpose, it in principle requires exploring the potential energy surface (PES) on the complex 3N-dimensional ( $N$ is the number of atoms in the system) configuration space and locating the global minimum of the PES. The challnging difficult exists as the cluster size is over a certain limit (e.g.10 inaccessible to the enumerative algorithm) since the posible number of configurations increases exponentially with the cluster size. There already exist several methods for PES exploring,e.g. enumeration search methods [20-22,28,29] and the autonomous basin climbing method [3O]. However, these methods may not be efficient enough to find the global minimum of the PES due to the exceptionally large configurational space of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . Alternatively, in recent years,the biological inteligent global optimization algorithm e.g., genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and diffrential evolution (DE) have been proved to be successful in optimizing atomic clusters structure [31],crystal structure [32,33],interface/boundary structure [34] in the material science community and solving complex optimization problems in other fields [35]. The GA has been used to investigate the structure and stability of defects clusters in quite limited systems [36-38]. Compared to other group intelligence methods,the DE algorithm as one of heuristic group intellgence approaches to solve global optimization problems has advantages of simplicity, robustness and high performance [35,39].

To address the aforementioned challenge, in the present work,an approach in the framework of the DE was developed to find the stable configuration of a nano-void at Fe/Mo/W GBs and also in their grain interiors.The choice of the three model systems is based on the consideration of their identical crystal structure in addition to the nuclear industrial application of Fe/Mo/W as structural materials in nuclear reactors [26,40,41]. Besides, we also tried to relate the formation energy of a nano-void to its geometrical parameters (e.g. the bonding between V-V and the bonding between the V and the surrounding atoms). And then,a predictive discrete model for the GB nano-void energetics was built.In addition,the kinetics of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in the vicinity of the GB was investigated by using latice kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) method [42]. Contrary to the object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) with a pre-constructed rate catalog for the events [42], therate catalog was rebuilt at every step of the LKMC.Furthermore,the energy barriers of all the transition paths of a nano-void were calculated in a paralll way by using nudge elastic band (NEB) method [43].

# 2.1.Atomic GB models

The interatomic interaction between Fe atoms was described by the empirical potential proposed by Mendelev et al. as part of their embedded-atom method (EAM) (Potential 2 in Ref. [44]). The EAM potentials were also used to describe interatomic interaction in Mo [45] and W [46] (EAM4 in Ref.[46]). Since the vacancy behavior at the GB relates to the GB structure, multiple GBs were modeled in this work, including 44 symmetric tilt GBs of $[ h \ k \ 0 ] / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ with tilt axis of [0 O1]（index $h$ and $k$ varies within the range of [2 13] and [1 11], respectively). The misorientation angle $( ~ \theta )$ for these GBs varies from 8.8 to 84.6 °； $\Sigma$ -value varies from 5 to 265.For comparison,several GBs with another tilt axis of[1 1 O] were also modeled, including $\Sigma 3 ( 1 \ 1 \ 1 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ] , \Sigma 3 ( 1 \ 1 \ 2 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ] , \Sigma 9 ( 1 \ 1 \ 4 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ] , \Sigma 9 ( 2 \ 2 \ 1 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ] , \Sigma 1 1 ( 1 \ 1 \ 3 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ] ,$

O], and $\Sigma 1 1 ( 3 3 2 ) / [ 1 1 0 ]$

2.2. Details for searching the ground state configuration of a $\boldsymbol { V _ { n } }$ at the GB by using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm

The life group intelligent algorithm DE [35,39] was employed to solve the global optimization issue related to finding the stable configuration of nano-void (Fig. 1(a). The system was divided into two regions: the core region Regl where the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ locates and its environment Reg2 (Fig. 1(b)). The space near a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in Regl was divided into mesh. Each site of the mesh denotes a state of the V composing a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in the un-relaxed space. Note that, the real structure of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ should be relaxed. Such notation of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ maps the relaxed space

to the un-relaxed space:

$$
n r e l a x e d ( V _ { n } ) \Leftrightarrow r e l a x e d ( V _ { n } ) ; R _ { r e l a x e d } = R _ { u n r e l a x e d } + \varepsilon ,
$$

where $R _ { u n r e l a x e d }$ and $R _ { r e l a x e d }$ isthe $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configuration before and after relaxation， respectively; $\varepsilon$ is relaxation-induced displacement of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . The individual $\mathrm { v }$ in a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ before relaxation was considered to locate at a site near a latice in the un-relaxed space (Eq. 1). For a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ,the $\mathrm { v }$ composing the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ was considered to locate at a crystal lattice site.Particularly, for the small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB, the space mesh was restricted to the position sites of a single $\mathrm { v }$ in the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ (the site with minimum $\mathrm { v }$ formation energy). Such restriction could significantly improve the search efficiency. The above approximation was found to be rational by comparing the configurations of the small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ found via the DE method with that found by enumeration search method. Furthermore, multiple runs of the optimizer lead to the same stable configuration of a nano-void. For the large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ，considering the possible expansion of the occupation range for the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ in the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ towards the bulk region from the GB,the mesh was also restricted to the region near the GB rather than only within the GB plane.

Based on above approximation, the problem of finding the global energy minimum on the PES of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ system containing $N I$ sites in Regl was transformed into to a combinatorial problem of choosing $n$ sites from Nl and minimizing the system energy:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \operatorname* { m i n } E = E ( x ) , x = [ x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ] , x i \mid _ { i = 1 , n } \in [ 1 , N 1 ] , } \end{array}
$$

where $x i$ is an integer denoting the individual site label in Regl. The DE was employed to solve this optimization problem over discrete integer space, including four steps of initialization, mutation, crossover, and selection, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c).

(a). Initialization

For a given calculated radius $r$ of Reg1, the candidate sites set $C { = } \{ \mathrm { C } _ { 1 } , \mathrm { C } _ { 2 } { , } _ { 2 } , \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { N } 1 } \}$ in Regl. Then, the basic parameters of the DE were set, including the population size $N p$ ， scale factor Fscale,and crossover probability Pcr. For each individual $\boldsymbol { x } ^ { j } \mid _ { j = 1 , 2 , \cdots , N p }$ , it was assigned to $n$ different integers randomly chosen from [1,N1]. After testing,Np was set to be approximately 30-10O depending on the size of the cluster. Fscale and Pcr were set to be 0.5 and O.1,respectively.The convergence of the defects configuration with respect to $r$ was checked by assigning $r$ to be several values,e.g. 5, 10, 15 and $2 0 \textup { \AA }$ . If the obtained configuration does not change with increasing $r$ ,a small $r$ is accepted. To reduce the number of candidate states for a $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { n } }$ ，the shape of Regl was also considered according to the possible shape of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ .For example, for a bulk $\mathrm { { V _ { n } } } .$ ， Regl could be assigned to be spherical, while it is a rectangle at the GB given its preferred growth direction along the GB.

(b). Mutation

For each individual, a mutant vector $( h ^ { j } \mid _ { j = 1 , 2 , \cdots , N p } )$ was generated according to (Fig. 1(c):

$$
h ^ { j } = r o u n d \{ x ^ { r 1 } + F s c a l e \times ( x ^ { r 2 } - x ^ { r 3 } ) \} ,
$$

where random indexes rl, r2, r3 were chosen from $[ 1 , \mathsf { N p } ]$ and round is a rounding off function. Since the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ energy was optimized over integer space (Eq. 2), $h ^ { j }$ in Eq. 3 was rounded off.

(c). Crossover

To increase the diversity of the population， crossover was introduced [39]. A trial vector $\boldsymbol \nu ^ { j } = [ \nu _ { 1 } ^ { j } , \nu _ { 2 } ^ { j } , . . . , \nu _ { n } ^ { j } ]$ was generated according to the following equation (Fig. 1(c):

$$
\nu _ { i } ^ { j } = \left\{ { h _ { i } ^ { j } , i f r a n d ( 0 , 1 ) \leq { \cal P } c r } \atop { x _ { i } ^ { j } , i f r a n d ( 0 , 1 ) > { \cal P } c r }  \right. ,
$$

where iand j refers to the certain single defect in the cluster and individual in the population,respectively. Their values lie in the range of $\mathrm { i } \in [ 1 , n ]$ and $\displaystyle \dot { \bf j } \in [ 1 , N p ]$ , and rand(O,1) is a uniform random number $\in [ 0 , 1 ]$

(d). Selection

Whether or not $ { \boldsymbol \nu } ^ { j }$ replaces $x ^ { j }$ as a new member of the population depends on the relative value of energy $E ( \nu ^ { j } )$ and $E ( x ^ { j } )$ (Fig. 1(c)). If $E ( \nu ^ { j } )$ is smaller than $E ( x ^ { j } ) , x ^ { j }$ is set to $ { \boldsymbol \nu } ^ { j }$ . Here, the energy of each offspring was defined to the system energy, which could be readily transformed into the corresponding $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy. After decoding a certain offspring,we obtained the corresponding unrelaxed $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configuration and created the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in an atomic system with an approximate size..

To improve the effciency for searching the ground state of the defects cluster, several methods were adopted.First,the individual with two identical components was avoided by means of penalty function. Equivalently, as the two Vs in a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ occupy the same state, the corresponding individual was given a very high energy. Second, the relaxation of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ expressed by an individual was performed every a specific steps. In principle, the system with a given initial rigid $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ has to be relaxed at $0 \mathrm { K }$ or at a finite temperature to get the accurate energy for the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . Nevertheless, we found it is very time consuming as the system was relaxed at each step.To achieve a balance between the algorithm efficiency and accuracy, the system was only relaxed at a certain intervals (Fig. 1(d)),e.g. 20 steps in the present calculations.As relaxing the system, the conjugate gradient method was used to minimize the system energy at $0 \mathrm { K }$ ; the optimal time-step that leads to the maximal reduction in the system energy during each relaxation step was determined by using the golden section search method. In certain case，after relaxing the system with a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ a $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ in the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ spontaneously jumps to other neighboring sites. Correspondingly, the mapping relation of the relaxed space to the un-relaxed space was modified. As finding the stable $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configuration at the Fe GB,we found that the system has to be relaxed at a finite temperature, e.g. $3 0 0 \mathrm { K }$ to obtain a low-energy V configuration. Third, to reduce the calculation time, the energies of allthe individuals in the population were calculated in a paralel way. Finally, once the stable configuration $\mathrm { { V _ { n 0 } } }$ has been obtained, a large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ was optimized based on a small "core parts” $\mathrm { { V _ { n 0 } } }$ (Fig. 1(b). In this case,only the configuration $\mathrm { { V _ { n - n 0 } } }$ was optimized by using the above DE algorithm (given the possible reconstruction of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ， $\scriptstyle \mathrm { n 0 = n - k }$ with $k { > } 1 0$ or other larger value). We also checked the parameter range of each individual and made periodical adjustment of the parameter to ensure that each component of the individual lies in the range of[1,N1]. We also tried to expressthe energy of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ by its geometrical parameters, e.g. the bonding between V-V and the bonding between the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ and the surrounding atoms. Once the express was obtained, the time-consuming relaxation of the system was avoided.

# 2.3. Energetics of $\textstyle V _ { n }$

To characterize the energetics of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ,we defined the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy in a normal way as:

$$
E _ { V _ { n } } ^ { f } = E _ { V _ { n } } ^ { t o t } - E _ { 0 } ^ { t o t } + n E _ { c o h } ,
$$

where $E _ { V _ { n } } ^ { t o t }$ is the energy of the system with a $\mathrm { V } _ { \mathrm { n } } , E _ { 0 } ^ { t o t }$ is the energy of a pure system without defects, $E _ { c o h }$ is the cohesive energy per atom in the bulk of $- 4 . 1 2 2 \ \mathrm { e V } .$ The clusters formation energy acts as an important parameter for determining the critical nucleation size of a cluster [26]. Particularly, $\Delta G _ { n } ^ { 0 } = - n k _ { B } T \ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } + E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V _ { n } } ^ { f }$ $d \Delta G _ { n } ^ { 0 } / d n = - k _ { s } T \ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } + \Delta E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } ^ { V _ { n } }$ [26]. For a given temperature $( T )$ and supersaturation concentration of the $\mathrm { v }$ （20 $( S _ { V } )$ , we can immediately obtain the critical nucleation size for a bulk void according to the energy level of a V near the void.

To characterize the binding tendency of a $\mathrm { v }$ to the nano-void, we also defined the $\mathrm { V } { - } \mathrm { V } _ { \mathrm { n } }$ binding energy

as:

$$
E _ { b } ^ { V - V _ { n } } = E _ { V } ^ { f } + E _ { V _ { n } } ^ { f } - E _ { V _ { n + 1 } } ^ { f } = E _ { V } ^ { f } - \Delta E _ { V _ { n } } ^ { f } ,
$$

Considering that $E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } ^ { { f } }$ is the energy level of the isolated V, the energy level of $\mathrm { v }$ near a cluster $( E _ { V } ^ { V _ { n } } )$ was thus defined as:

$$
E _ { V } ^ { V _ { n } } = E _ { V _ { n + 1 } } ^ { f } - E _ { V _ { n } } ^ { f } ,
$$

2.4.The kinetics of a nano-void near the GB determined by using latice kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) method

Given the complex local atomic environment near the GB,the kinetics of a V in the vicinity of the GB was investigated by using LKMC method [42]. Contrary to the OKMC with a pre-constructed rate catalog for the events,in the present study,the rate catalog was rebuilt at every step of the LKMC.Each transition of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ from the current state was assumed to involve only one jump of the V to its first- and/or second-nearest neighbor position. For each transition identified, the transition path was optimized by using the standard nudge elastic band (NEB) method [43],as illustrated in Fig.1(e). The energy barrersof all the transition paths were calculated in a paralel way. For a large nano-void, this could greatly improve the calculation speed. For the transition with the energy barrier of $E _ { a } ,$ its transition rate was calculated via $r = \nu _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } \exp ( \frac { - E _ { a } } { k _ { \scriptscriptstyle B } T } )$ ,where $\nu _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 }$ often in the range of $1 0 ^ { 1 2 } - 1 0 ^ { 1 3 } / s$ was assumed to be a fixed value of $1 0 ^ { 1 2 } / \mathrm { s } .$ The Boltzmann constant $k _ { B }$ has a value of $8 . 6 1 7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ eV/K. $T$ denotes absolute temperature. After the rate catalog was constructed, the transition pathway was selected according to the standard KMC algorithm, where the chosen probability of a transition is proportional to the transition rate. Then, one $\mathrm { v }$ of $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ jumps to the corresponding site.

The diffusion coefficient $( D )$ of a vacancy cluster at an elevated temperature was determined as the proportionally factor between the mean squared displacement of the masscenter of the void and the time. We found that a large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is easily trapped in a local basin at a low temperature. Therefore, the $D$ of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at a low temperature was extrapolated from the value at a high temperature once $\ln ( \mathrm { D } )$ and the reciprocal of temperature follows the Arrhenius relationship (Fig. 1(f)).

# 3.1. Formation, trap, leakage and emission of the V near Fe GBs

We begin with investigating the behavior of single V nearFe GBs although the energetics ofa V near Fe GBs has been studied systematically [47,48] and its kinetics near several GBs have also been studied [30,49-52]. By calculating the vacancy formation energy $( E _ { \mathit { V f } } ^ { G B } )$ at different sites near the GB, the site with the minimum $E _ { V f } ^ { G B } ( m E _ { V f } ^ { G B } )$ was found, which acts as the stable position of a $\mathrm { v }$ at the GB. The V distributes within several layers near the GB (supplementary Fig.S1). Figure4(a) presents $m E _ { \scriptscriptstyle { V f } } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle { G B } }$ as a function of misorientation angle $( \theta )$ . Although there is no obvious trend in $m E _ { \scriptscriptstyle { V f } } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle { G B } }$ with respect tc $\cdot \theta , m E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ for some special low- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \Sigma }$ CSL-GBs (e.g. $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ and $\Sigma 5 ( 3 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ } 1 ] )$ is noticeably larger than that for the GBs nearby. The twin boundary of $\Sigma 3 ( 1 \ 1 \ 2 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ]$ has the highest $m E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V f } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle G B }$ . The low-angle GB with $\theta$ less than $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { o w e s } m E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V f } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle G B }$ larger than that for the high-angle GB nearby, while the low-angle GB with $\theta$ higher than $7 5 ^ { \circ }$ has $m E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ smaller than thatfor the high-angle GB nearby.To reveal the distribution feature of the stable site for the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ at the GB, the spacing between these V-trapping sites (as marked by symbol $d$ in supplementary Fig. S2(a)) is also presented in Fig. 2(a) as a function of $\theta$ . It can be seen that $d$ basically exhibits a U-shape curve with $\theta$ , although it is scattered around a small value at the range of about $4 0 { - } 7 0 ^ { \circ }$ ：

In addition to the above static interaction parameters of the V with/within the GB, the LKMC and OKMC methods were further employed to explore the dynamic behavior of the V near the GB at an elevated temperature (mainly high temperature). Given the anisotropic strain field near the GB,latice kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) was firstly employed to study the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ trapping by the GB and reveal its dependence on the local atomic environment. It was found that the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ interacted with different GBs via three distinct mechanisms. The V near $\Sigma 5 ( 3 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ firstly followed a random walk and then moved straightforward towards the GB; it finaly located at the region of the several atomic layers near the GB (Fig.2(b)). Such behavior was readily understood based on the bulk-like migration energy curve in the region far away from the GB and a downhill shape of the curve near the GB (Fig. 2(b)). Near the low-angle GB of $\Sigma 8 5 ( 7 6 0 ) / [ 0 0$ 1]( $\theta { = } 8 1 . 2 ^ { \circ }$ , effective $\theta { = } 8 . 8 ^ { \circ }$ ), the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ in a wider range underwent a non-random walk drift towards the GB. The longer-ranged strain field near the low-angle GB could give rise to such behavior, consistent with the finding in Ref.[53] that the low-angle copper GB has large sink strength due to the effect of GB stress. However, as the misorientation angle further decreases (e.g.£1741(30 29 0)/[0 0 1] with effective value of $1 . 9 ^ { \circ } )$ , the V near the region lying between the dislocation cores passed through the GB (Fig. 2(c)); similar phenomenon was observed for the V near $\Sigma 2 2 1 ( 1 1 1 0 0 ) / [ 0 0 1 ]$ (supplementary Fig. S3). Such behavior was termed as the leakage effect. The V near the dislocation core of $\Sigma 1 7 4 1 ( 3 0 \ 2 9 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ exhibited similar migration-trapping behavior to that near $\Sigma 8 5 ( 7 6 0 ) / [ 0 0 1 ]$

To measure the effect of the leakage on the $\mathrm { v }$ trapping,we further calculated the probability of a V moving away from the GB as a function of its distance normal to the GB at several GBs at 300 K (Fig. 2(d) and (e)). Initially, a V was put at the site in the bulk region about $2 5 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ from the GB.As there is no a sink near the V, the V has the same probability moving forward and backward. As expected, near a sink, the probability for the V moving away from the GB is less than O.5 due to the trapping of the V by the GB.The probability curves for the three GBs of $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ] , \Sigma 5 ( 3 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ and $\Sigma 3 ( 1 \ 1 \ 2 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ]$ are similar. However, the probability in a wider range is less than O.5 for the low-angle GBs of $\Sigma 8 5 ( 7 6 0 ) / [ 0 0 1 ]$ and $\Sigma 2 2 1 ( 1 1 ~ 1 0 ~ 0 ) / [ 0 ~ 0 ~ 1 ]$ . Yet, at an identical position near the GB,the moving-out probability for the $\mathrm { v }$ near the low-angle GBs (particularly near the GB of $[ 1 7 4 1 ( 3 0 ~ 2 9 ~ 0 ) ) / [ 0 ~ 0 ~ 1 ] )$ is larger than that near the high-angle GBs of $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ] , \Sigma 5 ( 3 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ and $\Sigma 3 ( 1 \ 1 \ 2 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ]$

To investigate the segregation of the V/SIA to the GB and their re-emission out of the GB,object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) method was also employed. For this purpose,the atomic processes embedded in the OKMC model only include the V/SIA migration near the GB,trapping by the GB and emisson from the GB. Figure 2(f) presents the V motion trajectories near several GBs at several temperatures of 30o, 400 and 600 K. At 300 K, the V was observed to be occasionally reemitted from the twin GB of $\Sigma 3 ( 1 \ 1 \ 2 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ]$ at 300 K after segregation to the GB (Fig. 2(f)). As temperature increases to $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ , the V was frequently remitted from the twin GB (Fig. 2(f)). At a high temperature of $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ , the V trapped at the GB of $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 )$ was found to be reemitted frequently out of the GB,while the emission is just an occasional event at the GB of ∑85(13 1 O)(Fig. 2(f).The observed behavior is consistent with the magnitude of the V-GB binding energy in different GBs (the energy difference between $E _ { V f } ^ { b u l k }$ and $E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ in Fig. 2(a). Therefore, the single V behavior near the GB is related to both the local GB structure and the V-GB interaction parameters (e.g. V-GB binding energy).

To further investigate the defect accumulation in NC/PC Fe, the stochastic cluster dynamics (SCD [54])/OKMC was used. The atomic processs within the GB were thus not allowed to occur, while in the grain interior all the atomic processs including diffusion,annihilation, binding,dissociation were allowed to occur. We calculated the trapping amount of the defects flowing into the GB.The typical values of V-GB binding energy ( $E b$ or $E b _ { t r a p . }$ ） were adopted to represent several types of GBs. For the twin boundary of $\Sigma 3 ( 1$ $1 ~ 2 ) / [ 1 ~ 1 ~ 0 ] , E b _ { t r a p }$ for the $\mathrm { v }$ is $0 . 1 8 \mathrm { { \ e V } }$ (Fig. 2(a)). For the special CSL-GB, $E b _ { t r a p }$ for the $\mathrm { v }$ in $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 )$ of （20 $0 . 4 9 \mathrm { e V }$ was chosen as a representative value. For general high-angle GB or low-angle GB, $E b _ { t r a p }$ for the V was given of $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { e V }$ (the V-GB binding energy for $\Sigma 8 5 ( 7 ~ 6 ~ 0 ) \$ ). As the leakage process was taken into consideration, the leakage rate was given of O.5. Figure $2 ( \mathrm { g ) }$ presents the net trapping flux of the V/SIAs as a function of radiation dose under the condition of ${ \cal T } { = } 6 0 0 \mathrm { \ K }$ ， $L { = } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and $\tau { - } 1 0 ^ { - 2 } d p a { \bullet } s ^ { - 1 }$ . It can be seen that the accumulated V at the GB depend on $E b _ { t r a p }$ for the V. Compared to the other GBs, the net V concentration at the GB $( C _ { V } ^ { G B } )$ of $\Sigma 3 ( 1 \ 1 \ 2 ) / [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 ]$ is exceptionally lower. It implies that the twin boundary could not trap defects efficiently.For a low dose (e.g. O.005 dpa)，there is no significant difference in the defect accumulation in the other GBs due to the rarity of defects emission at a low dose. The $C _ { V } ^ { G B }$ in the general GB/low angle GB is highest and becomes smaller as the V was leaked. The $C _ { V } ^ { G B }$ in the CSL-GB has an intermediate level in these systems. Therefore, the GB trapping efficiency for the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ is sensitive to the V-GB binding energy. Consequently,as abundant Vs are present in the materials (e.g.under radiation), the quantity of Vs that segregate to the GB and compose the nano-void largely depends on the GB character.

# 3.2.V-clustering at Fe GB at high temperature

In addition to the relation of the trapping amount of the defects flowing into the GB to the local GB structure and V/SIA-GB binding energy,the determination of the defect accumulation at the GB also relies on the information of the defects within the GB,including the V kinetics at the GB,and V-Vbinding at the GB; of course,the V formation at the GB (Fig.2(a))also contributes the V accumulation within the GB (Fig. 2(g), although it also determines the V segregation via providing the V -GB binding energy (Fig. 2(a)).

For the V kinetics at the GB,we calculated the V migration energy barrier at the GB by using the standard NEB method [43]. Figure 3(a) shows the V migration energy barrier $\left( E _ { a } \right)$ along two nonequivalent paths within the GB as a function of the misorientation angle $\theta$ . It suggests that $E _ { a }$ along one path is much lower than that along the other one,as indicated by the V migration potential energy surfaces along the two types of paths at the GBs of $\Sigma 5 ( 3 \mid 0 )$ and $\Sigma 8 5 ( 7 6 0 )$ (supplementary Fig. S4). It implies that the V prefers to migrate on a certain low-energy barrier direction. Such speculation is supported by the quasi-one dimensional trajectory of the Vmotion at the GB drawn from the OKMC simulations of the V/SIA difusion at the GB plane at 300 and $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ (supplementary Fig. S5). Only at a high temperature, e.g. $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ ，the V/SIA at the special CSL-GBs of $5 5 ( 2 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } ]$ and $5 5 ( 3 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ and also £11(3 3 2)/[1 1 0] diffuses two dimensionally. In addition, $E _ { a }$ for the $\mathrm { v }$ along the GB exhibits U-shape dependence on $\theta$ . Basically, it could conclude that the V migration energy barrer is lower for the high-angle GBs compared to that for low-angle GBs. Different kinetics of the $\mathrm { v }$ at GBs may affect their clustering within the GB.

For V-V clustering/binding at the GB,we calculated V-V binding energy ( $( E _ { b } ^ { V - V } )$ ） (Eq. 6),which acts as an indicator for their clustering tendency. As shown in Fig. 3(b), $E _ { b } ^ { V - V }$ does not heavily depend on $\theta$ ： Nonetheless, $E _ { b } ^ { V - V }$ in most investigated GBs is positive and higher than that for a Fe bulk V-V pair except that in several GBs with the tilt axis of[1 1 O],indicating the atraction of Vs at the most GBs.Figure 3(c) presents the relation of $E _ { b } ^ { V - V }$ 0 $E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ .A positive corelation between the two variables was observed, indicating that the GB with high $E _ { \scriptscriptstyle { V f } } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle { G B } }$ has more stable V clusters within itself. The formation energy of small V clusters and the corresponding binding energy of the $\mathrm { v }$ with the V-cluster were also further calculated in several typical GBs (Fig. 3(d) and 3(e)). It could be seen that $E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { G B }$ approximately show a linear relation to the cluster size of $n$ , implying that the energy level of a $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ near the small V-cluster (the slope of the curve of the formation energy with respect to cluster size as defined by Eq. 7) basically remains a constant, diffrent from the quick change of the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ energetics near a bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ [20]. Furthermore, $E _ { b } ^ { V - V _ { n } }$ exhibits a weak dependence on the cluster size of $n$ , which arise from the linear configuration of the small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ within the GB. Nonetheless,the capillary law describes a different relation of the cluster energy to its size [54]. The $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ that repels to each other willbe annihilated or locate at the GB randomly.In face-centered cubic (fcc) systems [55],the Vs randomly generated at GBs induced the GB phase transformation. In the present Work, the emphasis is on the alternative path for Vs at the GB as formating Vclusters and GB voids. These energetic results guide the modeling of theV accumulation at different GBs.

Given the net flux of the V into the GB and the Vs properties at the GB (Fig. 2(g), the special CSL-GB acts as a candidate that probably develops a void structure under cumulative irrdiation. Considering the V attracting each other (e.g. the GB of $\Sigma 5 ( 3 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ } 1 ] )$ , the trapped Vs could nucleate at the GB and grow to a GB void,as observed in experiments [3].To explore the GB nano-void formation mechanism,the structure, morphology and energetics of nano-V clusters at Fe GB of $\Sigma 5 ( 3 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ were further explored by using the DE method, although the structures of small $\mathrm { V _ { n } s }$ $( \mathrm { n } { < } 5 )$ in bulk Fe are well-known [20,26]. Figure 3(f) presents the energetics of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB. The energetics of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ have unique features. At the GB, from a single V to the 1D and then 2D configurations, the V has several typical energy levels corresponding to the specific folding configuration. The energy level oscillates with the size as $n$ is larger than certain value, which is similar to the energetic behavior of small W bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } / S I A _ { n } }$ in Ref. [56] ( $\mathrm { \acute { n } } { } ^ { < 1 0 }$ for $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ and $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { n } } < 2 0$ for $\mathrm { S I A _ { n } }$ ). It arises from the formation of the interface between the defects and the atoms nearby. To understand the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configuration transition during its growth at the GB,a mathematical setting for examining this transition was proposed (illustrated in supplementary Fig. S6(h)). The mode was based on the bonding among defects and the atoms nearby with a core idea to increase the shared area of the defect clusters and further increase the bonding strength. The formation energy for a defect cluster $\mathrm { V } _ { 2 \mathrm { n } } / \mathrm { S I A } _ { 2 \mathrm { n } }$ with a 1D and folding configurationis $E _ { 1 } = n E _ { V / S L A } ^ { f 1 } - ( 2 n - 1 ) E _ { b } ^ { x } + E _ { s 1 } \mathrm { a n d } E _ { 1 } = n E _ { V / S L A } ^ { f 1 } - [ 2 ( n - 1 ) E _ { b } ^ { x } + ( 2 n - 1 ) E _ { b } ^ { y } ] + E _ { s 2 } \mathrm { a n d } E _ { 2 } .$ ， respectively. Here, $E _ { s 1 } / E _ { s 2 }$ is the energy increase in the configuration energy due to the formation of the interface between the cluster and the surrounding atoms; $\boldsymbol { E } _ { b } ^ { x }$ and $E _ { b } ^ { y }$ denotes the V-V binding energy in the two directions parallel and nonparallel to tilt axis, respectively. We assume that each isolated V/SIA in the twoconfigurations hasthesame formationenergyo $\cdot E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 1 } , E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 2 } ( E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 1 } = E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 2 } )$ and $E _ { s 1 } = E _ { s 2 }$ .It is energetically favorable for the cluster to be folded as $E _ { 1 } \geq E _ { 2 }$ ，which leads to the condition $2 n \geq \frac { E _ { b } ^ { x } } { E _ { b } ^ { y } } + 1$ +1.For a difern ai of $E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 1 } , E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 2 }$ ,we have h condionon $2 n \geq \frac { E _ { b } ^ { x } + E _ { b } ^ { y } } { E _ { b } ^ { y } + ( E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 1 } - E _ { V / S I A } ^ { f 2 } ) / 2 } .$

As displayed in Fig. $3 ( \mathrm { g ) }$ , a single $\mathrm { v }$ resides at the GB in the form of V-I-V complexes (I denotes an interstitial) along[3 1 O] with the SIA located nearly on the GB plane and acting as the center of the two Vs siting at the two symmetric sites on the two GB sides (Fig.3(g)). Such complex has energy lower than the point-alike V structure found based on MS method [30,47-52]. Clusters $\mathrm { V } _ { 2 } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { V } _ { 7 }$ are composed of such V-I-V complex growing along [0 0 1] (Fig. 3(g). Then, $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { 8 } }$ is folded from 1D configuration along [0 0 1] to a 2D platelet configuration composed of the same complex (Fig. 3(g) for $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { 8 , } }$ ); two columns of $( \mathrm { V } { - } \mathrm { I } { - } \mathrm { V } ) _ { 4 }$ complex are parallel to each other. During the above each stages of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ growth, the configuration folding decreases the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy effectively (Fig. 3(f)). The mode of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ growth along [O O 1] and then undergoing folding repeats as $n$ increases (Fig. 3(g)). As a result, $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ grows two dimensionally within the GB. Yet,the direction of the complex shifts from [3 1 O]to[111]. Inaddition,it was also found that the lattice surrounding the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ of the V-I-V complex is heavily strained approximately in the direction normal to the GB. With $n$ increasing, more atoms contract towards the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . The maximal displacement is as large as 0.7 A. Compared to the small strain around a bulk spherical void [57] (the present EAM potential predicts the displacement around a bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is less than $0 . 1 \textup { \AA }$ after relaxation),the strain here observed near a GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is significantly large, which may arise from the fact that the compress of a bulk 3D void needs more work compared to the compress of a 2D GB void. A bulk void is a neutral sink because of a lack of associated strain fields [8,26]. Therefore,the Fe-GB nano-void could act as a preferential sink.The strain filed pattern also changes with $n$ . The contraction strain field around the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in the form of V-I-V complex is probably an intrinsic feature in the 2D defect GB system. It may be related to the elastic modulus. Since the greater the elastic modulus, the greater the stress needed for a given strain, the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at a W CSL-GB may not have such low-energy V-I-V complex structure (the preliminary MS calculation of the two types of structures suggests that the V-I-V structure is unstable at W GB of $\Sigma 5 ( 3 ~ 1 0 ~ 0 ) / [ 0 ~ 0 ~ 1 ] )$ （号

As $n$ further increases,the size of the cluster in the direction of [O O 1] is so large that the DE fails to optimize the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configuration as viewing the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ as a collection of single Vs. We turn to optimize the GB structures with diferent columns of Vs along [O0 1] by the DE method. By such approximation, it implies an infinite size of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in the [O O 1] direction, which may be rational only for a sufficiently large GB void. In this way, the optimized problem is finding the low energy configuration as creating Nc columns of Vs from Mc columns of atoms along [0 O 1] in the optimized region (equivalent number of Vs is $N x \times N c$ with Nx as the number atoms of a atom column along [0 O 1]). The optimization was carried out within a rectangle region with a maximal size of about $6 0 \textup { \AA }$ in the direction of $[ 1 ~ \overline { { 3 } } ~ 0 ]$ and half-width of $1 0 \textup { \AA }$ in the direction of [3 1 0](the pink rectangle in supplementary Fig. S6(a)). It was found that for different values of $N c$ ， the Vs at the GB developed to two types of structures. For a small $N c < { N c } ^ { * }$ (or equivalently the void height $h$ in supplementary Fig. S6(c) is smaller than a specific value), the vacant region is unstable. During the structural relaxation of a GB system with a void, a group of atoms surrounding the region rearranged their positions,accompanied by the contraction of the atoms in the grain interior towards the GB.As a result, the metastable GB phase was formed (supplementary Fig. S6(a) and S6(b)), which has a different structural unit to the pure GB. Actually, the sign of the transition of a large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ to the metastable GB phase also found during optimizing the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ structure at the GB.For a large $N c \geq { N c } ^ { * }$ ， the vacant region no longer collapsed, but formed a stable GB void phase with naked low-energy surfaces decorated with steps (supplementary Fig. S6(c) and S6(d)). Meanwhile, the strain near the GB recovered from the contraction strain (supplementary Fig. S6(e) and S6(f)). The void structure at the GB is similar to that in a bulk iron.

We also found that the V-V binding energy at the GB and V kinetics at the GB are insuficient to determine the GB void morphology.For instance,the migration energy barrier of the single V along the GB and particularly V-V binding energy in some GB: $\ G \ ( \Sigma 5 ( 2 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ] , \Sigma 5 ( 3 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ] , \Sigma 1 3 ( 5 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ] , \ G \$ （204号 ∑13(3 2 0)/[001],∑25(4 30),£85(7 60), £85(13 10)/[001],£11(3 3 2)/[1 1 0]) have similar level. As the input parameters to the OKMC model were chosen from these GBs， we obtained similar $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ （204号 nucleation/growth behavior for these GBs (supplementary Fig. S7). However,the DE calculation of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configuration within theses GBs reveals two types of $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ morphology at the GB. Only at the GBs of £5(3 1 0) and £5(2 1 0) does the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ have 1D-2D configuration, which further extends to the bulk region. The $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the remaining GBs possesses a 1D configuration along the tilt axis except that has V-V repulsion interaction. These results suggest the important role of the GB character n coarse-grained modeling defect accumulation in PCs/NCs. Besides, the information of the large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ structure plays a role in predicting damage structure evolution at the GB in addition to the energetic and kinetic properties of point defects and smal clusters.

# 3.3. Structure and energetics of the W/Mo GB $\textstyle { V _ { n } }$

We have simulated V accumulation in Fe GBs (Figs.2 and 3), finding that the behavior of clusters at the GB is essential to predicting radiation response of the GB.To explore the generalization of the results (mainly the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation at the GB and its relation to the local GB structure), we further calculated the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ （20 configuration at Mo/W GBs by using the DE method. Figure 4(a-d) presents the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ energetics at several Mo/W GBs (the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configuration in bulk W is shown in supplementary Fig. S8; some of $\mathrm { V _ { n } s }$ in bulk Mo have ientical configurations). It is found that the GBs could be divided into two categories according to their $E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { G B }$ as separated by the orange dash line in Fig. 4(a) and (c). The $E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { G B }$ at the GB of £5(3 1 0) and £5(2 1 0)/[0 0 1] is significantly higher than that at the other GBs. The single V formation energies at the two GBs are also higher than that at the other GBs. Furthermore, the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy follows a different power law with respect to cluster size compared to that for a bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . It is well-known that the formation energy for a bulk 3D $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ has a dependence of $\mathrm { n } ^ { 2 / 3 }$ [26] and the calculated values for bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in W/Mo indeed obey such relation. However, $E _ { V n f } ^ { G B }$ was found to be expressed by the linear combination of ${ n ^ { 1 / 2 } }$ and $n ^ { 1 }$ ， which ensures the convergence of $E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { G B } \to E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k } | n > n 0 ( 1 / 2 < 2 / 3 < 1 )$ , implying that a GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ finally extends to the grain interior and becomes a bulk-alike void as its size is sufficiently large (supplementary Fig. S6(c) and S6(d)). Besides, the coefficient for $n ^ { 1 / 2 }$ is much larger than that for $n ^ { 1 }$ (e.g. for $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at W GB of $\Sigma 5 ( 3 \mid 0 )$ ，the two coefficients for $n ^ { 1 / 2 }$ and $n ^ { 1 }$ are 4.21 and 0.46, respectively), suggesting that a small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB could be considered as a planar loop. The differentiation formation energy was clearly divided into two stages (Fig. 4(b) and (d). Both $\Delta E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { G B }$ and $\Delta E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k }$ decline quickly from 1 to about 5and then oscilate between several typical levels. Such behavior could not be captured by the above n-power law continuum model which predicts that $\Delta E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k / G B } = \Delta E _ { Y } ^ { b u l k / G B } [ n ^ { 2 / 3 } - ( n - 1 ) ^ { 2 / 3 } ] / [ 2 ^ { 2 / 3 } - 1 ] \qquad ( \mathrm { n o t e } \qquad \mathrm { t h a t } \qquad \mathrm { i n } \qquad \mathrm { R e f . } \qquad \mathrm { R e f . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . } \qquad \mathrm { R e . }$ [20], $E _ { b } ( n ) = E _ { f } + [ E _ { b } ( 2 ) - E _ { f } ] [ n ^ { 2 / 3 } - ( n - 1 ) ^ { 2 / 3 } ] / [ 2 ^ { 2 / 3 } - 1 ]$ ; here we have modified some symbols according to Eqs.

(6) and (7)). In the following section，we will see that the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ with a low $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ energy level is more thermodynamically stable which serves as void nucleation center (the $n$ that satisfies $k _ { \scriptscriptstyle B } T \ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } = \Delta E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k }$ （20 determines the critical nucleation size [26]).

Correspondingly, the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ configurations at the investigated nine GBs are clearly classified to two categories. In the W/Mo GBs of $5 5 ( 3 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } ]$ and $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ } ]$ (Fig. 4(e-h)), the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ initially adopts a linear configuration along the tilt axis on one side of the GB (note that the small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the two Fe GBs has a V-I-V complex configuration). The $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ occupies the stable site for a single $\mathrm { v }$ at the GB, except for $\mathrm { V } _ { 2 }$ at W GB of $5 5 ( 2 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ (Fig. 4(f)). Then, the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ develops to a 3D structure centered at the GB plane, occupying additional sites in addition to the $\mathrm { v }$ stable site. During the development of a large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ , it did not always grow on the basis of $\mathrm { { V _ { n - 1 } } }$ , the reconstruction of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ was accompanied (e.g. from V4 to V5 in Fig. 4(e) and for some bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } s }$ in iron as suggested in supplementary Fig. S9). For some special clusters with a certain $n$ ， its configuration is mirror-symmetric about the GB plane,which may arise from the intrinsic symmetry of the CSL-GB.With the highly symmetric cluster as a center, the newly arriving Vs were absorbed at one side of the center until another symmetric $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ was formed. Through such growth process, the （204号 $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ extends in the three directions. We also found that the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB of $5 5 ( 3 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ 1 ]$ more frequently develops to a symmetric structure than the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB of $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \ 1 \ 0 ) / [ 0 \ 0 \ ]$ . In the remaining GBs, the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ was aligned along the tilt axis one-dimensionally with a V-I-V complex configuration.

We then examined the relation of the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ morphology (3D versus 1D structure and point structure versus V-I-Vcomplex) to the local GB structure. We note that a bulk Vhas equivalent neighboring sites with identical vacancy formation energy. Besides, the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ with cluster formation energy close to bulk values possesses a 3D configuration. Therefore, the configuration of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ could be related to the fluctuation degree of the potential energy surface near the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . Figure 5(a) presents the $\mathrm { v }$ formation energy distribution at several GBs of W. Indeed, in the GBs of $5 5 ( 3 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } ]$ and $5 5 ( 2 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } ]$ ,the stable sites for the V with minimum formation energy are very near to each other not only in the direction along the tilt axis but also in the other direction.In the other GBs,the stable sites are aligned along the tilt axis.Furthermore, there are several atom columns with high V formation energy between the stable sites in the other direction along the GB.To further measure the flat degree of the potential energy surface at the GB,we calculated the standard error of vacancy formation energy $( E _ { V } ^ { f } )$ for the group of GB atoms with low $E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } ^ { { f } }$ as a function of the GB type in W. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the standard error well indicates two categories of the GBs with 3D/1D $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ morphology. A small error implies that the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ prefers to condense along a certain direction, forming a 1D structure, while a large error implies that the local environment varies gently and the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ easily extends towards the surrounding sites via a 3D manner.

In addition to the 3D/1D configuration of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB, we further analyzed the strain around a GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ and its relation to the GB structure (Fig. 5(c-e)). We found that the configuration of the V at the GB as a point or V-I-V complex is related to both the GB excess volume and the bulk modulus.The system either with low bulk modulus (e.g.Fe) or with smallexcess volume (e.g. W/Mo) has low energy V configuration in the form of V-I-V complex, while the Vbehaves like a point at the GB latice site with large excess volume and high bulk modulus.

# 3.4.Discrete model for the energetics of a GB $\textstyle V _ { n }$

As mentioned in the above section,the continuum model fails to capture the oscillated feature in the differential formation energy. Consequently, the thermal stability of a nano-void could not be welldescribed by the model; the further formation and growth mechanism of the nano-void predicted by the model could be different to the real path. Next,we built discrete energetic models for GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ by using the locally structural information of a cluster rather than only using the cluster size as in the continuum model. As observing the configuration of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ (Fig. 6(a))， we found that the Vs within the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ were naturally connected by a series of bonds. Considering the interaction among Vs of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ and interaction between the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ with the surrounding atoms, the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy was represented as the linear combination of the V-V and V-atom bonding: $E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k / G B } = \sum _ { i } ( n _ { V - V i } I _ { V - V i } + n _ { V - A i } J _ { V - A i } )$ (Fig: 6(b),erethemextedstallhe neighboring V-V and V-atom pairs; $n _ { V - V i }$ is the number of $i$ -th nearest V-V neighboring pair, $I _ { V - V i }$ is the bonding strength for the V-V pair, $n _ { V - A i }$ is the number of $i$ -th nearest V-atom neighboring pair, and $J _ { V - A i }$ .is the bonding strength for the V-atom pair. Note that, for a specific neighboring distance, $I _ { V - V i }$ and $J _ { V - A i }$ are constants.Such a linear model leads to the representation of the first-order diferentiation of the formation energy as $\Delta E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k / G B } = \sum _ { i } \left( \Delta n _ { V - V i } I _ { V - V i } + \Delta n _ { V - A i } J _ { V - A i } \right)$ . For the bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ，theV-Vc nearest neighbor, while V-A pair was only set to be the first nearest neighbor. For the GB $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { n } }$ , the all the V-V and V-A neighboring distances were firstly calculated. According to their distribution, the typical values were chosen. In the discrete model, the parameters $I _ { V - V i }$ and $J _ { V - A i }$ could be obtained by fitting the calculated void formation energy to its structural variables $n _ { V - \hat { V _ { l } } }$ and $n _ { V - A i }$ ，By considering the contribution of different neighboring V-V and V-atom pairs, the model naturally distinguishes the anisotropic feature of a nano-void with different facets.Besides,the model gives a discrete expression for the surface energy per area.The iron ${ < } 1 0 0 { > }$ surface is taken as an example. For this surface, $E _ { { \scriptscriptstyle V _ { n } } f } = n ( 2 I _ { { \scriptscriptstyle V } - V 2 } + 4 J _ { { \scriptscriptstyle V } - A 1 } )$ , while the surface area is （20 $S = n s _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ with $s _ { 0 }$ asthe area of an atom. We could obtain the surface energy per area as （20 $\gamma = E _ { { \scriptscriptstyle V _ { n } } f } \mathrm { \Delta } / S = ( 2 I _ { { \scriptscriptstyle V } - V 2 } + 4 J _ { { \scriptscriptstyle V } - A 1 } ) \mathrm { \Omega } / s _ { 0 }$ . Such model gives y a value of $1 . 7 1 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ ，well consistent with the calculated value of $1 . 7 8 ~ \mathrm { J / m } ^ { 2 }$ by using molecular statics.

As presented in Fig. 6(c), such discrete bonding formula could describe both formation energy and its first-order differentiation with a very high precision (e.g. the maximum residual error for Fe bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy is as low as $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { e V }$ in the discrete model based on V-V and V-atom bonding, which is as high as $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { e V }$ in the continuum model). Consequently, the oscillation in the V energy level (Fig. 6(c)) was well reproduced by the discrete model,while the continuum model [54] neglecting the topology of the cluster and its structural relation with the underlying latice fails in describing such oscilation feature (Fig. 6(c)). In addition,the discrete model also naturall predicts a limited number of energy levels of the V near a void since the $\Delta n _ { V - V i }$ and $\Delta n _ { V - A i }$ present in its energetic model have limited number of integer values. Besides, we could understand the discrete energy level of V based on such discrete model. A specific energy level in

Fig. 6(c) corresponds to a local atomic environment that a new V occupies near a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . Figure $6 ( { \mathrm { e - g } } )$ suggests that the discrete model also applies to describe the energetics of the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . Magana et al. [58] also proposed a modified Ising model to describe the clustering of Vs in bulk silicon voids.Although their model succeeded in describing the oscilation of V-voids binding energy,the model precision is lower than our model (e.g. the predicted binding energy for the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ with ${ \mathrm { V } } _ { 1 } { \mathrm { - } } { \mathrm { V } } _ { 3 }$ is identical in Fig.1 in Ref. [58]). Our discrete model also has predictive property. With the discrete model,the energy of the population in DE optimization of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ structure (section 2.2） was directly calculated by only counting the number of neighboring V-V and V-atom pairs. Compared to the relaxation of the system with a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ， the optimization speed was significantly improved. For a large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ (e.g. $\mathrm { \tt m } { > } 1 0 0 \$ ), such discrete model based calculation of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ energy could efficiently leads to the ground state of a void.

The alternative discrete model was built based on the geometrical surface units of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . A bulk Fe $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ contains two types of geometrical surface units with area of $s _ { a }$ and $s _ { b }$ , respectively (as illustrated in Fig. 6(a) by $\mathrm { V } _ { 1 5 } \mathrm { \dot { \Omega } }$ ). The $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy was thus represented by $E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k } = \sum _ { i } n _ { i } \gamma _ { i } s _ { i }$ , where $n _ { i }$ is the number of surface unit $i , \gamma _ { i }$ is its surface energy per area and $s _ { i }$ is its area. But such model has a precision of only $0 . 7 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ to describe the bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ formation energy. The precision is too low to describe the differentiation formation energy that is on the order of $0 { - } 3 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ (Fig. 4(b) and (d)). Actually, a similar expression was employed in the Wull construction based energetic model for a void polyhedron [59], where the ratio of the surface energy pre area of different surfaces of the void determines the equilibrium shape of the void. The failing of these models to describe the energy of a nano-void arises from the neglected contribution of the junction between diferent surfaces to the total energy of the void. Compared to a very limited fraction of the junction in a meso-/macro-scopic void, the junction in a nano-void could play an important role in its energy. In a more approximated model based on spherical assumption of the shape of a void, the energy of a void is expressed 8 $E _ { V _ { n } f } ^ { b u l k / G B } = \gamma s$ [26],heresifaceeed $s$ isits area.Such modelneglectsthe anisotropic surface tension for diffrent surfaces ofthe void in addition to the aforementioned the role of the junction in the total energy of the void.Therefore,these surface-based models do not apply to describe the formation energy of a nano-void, particularly its differential formation energy.

# 3.5. Stability of a GB $\textstyle { V _ { n } }$

We finally investigated the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of a GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ A $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at a high temperature will dissociate. Correspondingly, the time for the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ to emit a $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ at an elevated temperature was used to characterize its thermodynamic stability (supplementary Fig. S10(a). An emitted V from the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ could locate at the GB or in the bulk (the corresponding time is $\mathbf { t } _ { 1 } / \mathbf { t } _ { 2 }$ ). Due to the low V energy level at the GB (Fig. 2(a), Fig. 4(b) and 4(d)) and migration energy barrier along the GB (Fig.3(a)), a smaller time $( t _ { I } )$   
I was employed to characterize the lifetime of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the interested GBs of £5(3 1 0) and ∑5(2 1 0) where the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ develops three dimensionally (Fig. $3 ( \mathrm { g ) }$ and Fig. 4(e-h). As for the dynamic stability of the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ,the   
diffusion coefficient of the ${ \mathrm { V } } _ { \mathrm { n } } \left( D \right)$ within the GB was selected as an indicator. A small $D$ implies that the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ （204号   
remains immobile at a specific temperature. The $D$ was calculated either directly via calculating the mean   
squared displacements of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB at an elevated temperature or via the extrapolation from the   
:high-temperature Arrhenius diffusion coefficient $( D )$ (Fig. 1(f) and supplementary Fig. S10(b), section 2.4). Figure 7(a-c) shows the lifetime for a GB/bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in Fe/Mo/W. We found that the lifetime of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$   
）depends heavily on the cluster size and its location (GB or bulk) in addition to temperature. It can be seen that although the lifetime for a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ exhibits an increasing trend with the cluster size, the increasing trend is non-monotonous. Some $\mathrm { V _ { n } s }$ with the special size (e.g. $\mathrm { { V } } _ { 6 } , \mathrm { { V } } _ { 8 }$ and $\mathrm { V } _ { 1 5 } , \mathrm { V } _ { 5 9 }$ in bulk Fe; $\mathrm { V } _ { 2 4 }$ $\mathrm { V } _ { 3 1 }$ at Mo GB of £5(3 1 0)/[0 0 1]; $\mathrm { V } _ { 1 3 }$ and $\mathrm { V } _ { 2 1 }$ at W GB of $\Sigma 5 ( 2 \mathrm { ~ l ~ } 0 ) / [ 0 \mathrm { ~ } 0 \mathrm { ~ } 1 ] )$ have longer lifetime compared to the adjacent ones,acting as stable centers for void nucleation/growth. With the temperature increasing, the lifetime for both GB and bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ reduces greatly， indicating the instability of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at a high temperature thermodynamically. Yet, $\mathrm { V } _ { 5 9 }$ in bulk Fe is still stable at a high temperature of $7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ ， as indicated by a lifetime of over one day. The thermodynamic stability may be related to the structural symmetry of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ (Fig. 4(e-h), Fig. 6(a)). At a low temperature of $3 0 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ ，most of $\mathrm { V _ { n } s }$ are stable except $\mathrm { V } _ { 1 }$ and $\mathrm { V } _ { 2 }$ . At an

intermediate temperature of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ , only large cluster $( \mathrm { n } > 2 5 )$ ） and some small $\mathrm { V _ { n } s ( V _ { 6 } , V _ { 8 } , V _ { 1 3 } , V _ { 1 4 } , V _ { 1 5 } ) }$ are stable thermodynamically. We also found that the lifetime for a GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at a certain temperature is much smaller than that for a bulk $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { n } , }$ implying that the bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is much stable than a GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . In other words, the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ has to nucleate either on a large $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ or under high supersaturation of Vs at the GB, while a relatively small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ could at as the nucleation sites for a bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ . Of course, the gaseous impurities also stabilize a void [7-9].

Next, the dynamic stability of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ was obtained based on its $D$ . Figure 7(d-f) displays the $D$ for small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB/bulk in Fe/Mo/W. We found that the $D$ for a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ exhibits a decreasing trend with $n$ ，which however does not decrease monotonically with $n$ and shows a discrete feature. The lower the temperature is, the more obvious the discretization in the $D$ is (e.g. ${ \mathrm { V } } _ { 6 }$ and $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { 8 } }$ have exceptionally small $D$ at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ ). The small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ still has a considerable mobility,as suggested by its moderate $D$ . Similar relation of the cluster mobility to its structural symmetry was also found for bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ in iron (supplementary Fig. S11). The theoretical formula of a bubble $D$ derived based on the surface diffusion [60] (the $D$ is proportional to the reciprocal of $R ^ { 4 }$ or $n ^ { 4 / 3 }$ ，where $R$ is the radius of a bubble) does not apply to a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ ， particularly at a low temperature. The $D$ for a GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is not necessarily higher than that for a bulk $\mathrm { { V _ { n } } . }$ ，although GBs have been considered as high-diffusivity paths [26]. For the GBs of $\Sigma 5 ( 3 \mid 0 )$ and $\Sigma 5 ( 2 1 0 )$ in Mo and GB of £5(2 1 0) in W, the GB $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ has a higher $D$ compared to that for a bulk $\mathrm { { V _ { n } } ; }$ ，while the diffusion is slower along the Fe/W GB of ∑5(3 1 0) than in bulk $\mathrm { F e / W } .$

Considering both the thermodynamic and dynamic stability, the stability of a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is summarized,as illustrated in Fig. 7(f). At regime $\jmath$ ,the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is unstable both thermodynamically and kinetically (e.g. $\mathrm { V } _ { 1 } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { V } _ { 5 }$ at Mo GB of £5(3 1 0)). The $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ with $n { < } n O$ falls into such regime, which contributes to the growth of a void via its dissociation $( n { > } 1 )$ and diffusion. Such mechanism is different to the classic Ostwald ripening mechanism, where the large void grows only by the dissociation of small voids. Besides, the $n O$ for bulk $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is larger than that for a GB $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { n } , }$ implying that a GB void quickly becomes ripened compared to a bulk void. At regime 2, the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ with $\scriptstyle n = n ^ { * } > n I$ acts as a stable center for the $\mathrm { v }$ to nucleate both thermodynamically and dynamically (e.g. $\mathrm { V } _ { 1 5 }$ and $\mathrm { V } _ { 5 9 }$ in Fe bulk and $\mathrm { V } _ { 1 3 }$ and $\mathrm { V } _ { 2 1 }$ at W GB of £5(2 1 0)). At regime $3$ ，the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ $( n 0 { < } n { < } n I )$ is thermodynamically stable but could diffuse (e.g. bulk ${ \mathrm { V } } _ { 6 }$ and $\mathrm { \Delta V _ { 8 } } ^ { \mathrm { \prime } }$ ） to bind with other stable clusters.At regime $^ { 4 }$ ，the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ is immobile but could dissociate，which could be the large cluster composed of some unstable branches and a stable center.

# 4. Discussion

4.1. Effect ofthe discretization nature of the energetics and kinetics on void formation and ripening

We have shown that both the energetics and kinetics of the GB/bulk void exhibit a discretization feature (Fig.3(e) and 3(f),Fig. 4(b) and 4(d),Fig. 6(c)and 6(e-g),Fig.7,supplementaryFigs. S10 and S11). Next we examine its effect on the void formation and ripening by using diferent binding models for the description of vacancy agglomeration. In the first case, we compared the model predicted average void size during SCD annealing to that detected in positron annihilation spectroscopy experiments on neutron irradiated single-crystal bccFe [61]. Results suggest that our discrete model leads to the average cluster size of 9 after annealing the system initially containing a concatenation of $1 0 ^ { 2 5 } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 3 }$ Vs at $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 50 minutes (Fig. 8(a),consistent with the experimental value, while the continuum model underestimates the average size. The further annealing simulations at high temperatures of $1 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ suggest that small clusters also drive the ripening process of the void in addition to free vacancies (Fig. 8(b)and 8(c).For the GB void formation,there are no direct experiments as benchmarks to simulations.Yet, results indicate the significant diferences in cluster size distribution predicted by the two diferent models (Fig.8(d) and 8(e), while the difference is small at a low temperature (Fig. 8(d). The discrete model correctly reproduces the formation of particularly stable cluster centers, as predicted by the V energy level near a $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ (Fig. 3(f), Fig. 4(b) and 4(d)) and also the cluster lifetime (Fig. 7(a-c)). Meanwhile,the maximum cluster size is smaller predicted by the continum model than by the discrete model due to the underestimated energy level of the V near the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$

with low thermal stability (Fig. 3(e), Fig. 6(e-g))

4.2. Vacancy accumulation and void formation mechanism at GBs under radiation At a high temperature in a PC system, the GB response mechanism to irradiation depends on the GB structure [2-4,26,27]. The first determinate factor of the GB radiation response is the quantity of the Vs segregated to the GB,which is related to both the V-GB interaction strength and the distribution of the trapping sites at the GB (Fig.2). Such factor dominates the vacancy concentration near the GB and further formation of the void-denuded zone near the GB. As illustrated in Fig. 9,the V energy level at the GB （20 $( E l - E 4 )$ varies significantly with the GB type (Fig. 2(a), Fig. 4(b) and (d). These energy levels define two decisive variables of the V-GB binding energy $( E b _ { t r a p } )$ ）and the energetic driving force of the Vs to be clustered at the GB $( E b _ { c l u s t e r i n g } )$ . Depending on the magnitude of $E b _ { t r a p }$ ，the $\mathrm { v }$ either permanently resides at the GB after segregation or is reemitted out of the GB (Fig. 9). The reemission of the trapped $\mathrm { v }$ at the GB is closely associated with the GB structure due to the scattered but relative small $E b _ { t r a p }$ for the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ in different GBs (Fig. 2). The experimentally observed difference in the radiation response near different types of GBs, e.g. void-denuded zone formation and non-denuded zone mainly relies on the diffrence in the V-GB binding strength in these GBs. The twin boundary could not effctively trap the V due to the high Venergy level $( E I )$ and exceptionally small $E b _ { t r a p }$ (Fig. 2(a),Fig. 9); no sufficient defects could survive at the GB (Fig. 2(g). The low-angle GB and high-angle general GB could effectively absorb Vs from the grain interior (Fig. 2(a), 2(e),2(f)) due to the low energy level of the $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ at the GB ( $\cdot { } E 3$ and $E 4$ ） and the corresponding large $E b _ { t r a p }$ (Fig. 2(a). The larger strain field near the low-angle GB also promotes the trapping of the V (Fig. 2(b) and 2(c)). Depending on the distribution of the trapping site along the GB,the trapping efficiency of the extremely low-angle GB is however lower compared to the general high-angle GB due to the leakage of the defects from the bulk-like region between the dislocation-centers (Fig. 2(d) and 2(g)). The special CSL-GB has an intermediate V energy level (Fig. 2(a),Fig. 9); correspondingly, the net quantity of Vs trapped at the GB lies between the values for the twin boundary and low-angle/general high-angle GBs (Fig. 2(g)).

The additional determinate factor of the GB radiation response is their topology at the GB after the segregation. The relevant defects properties within the GB include migration style along the GB, migration energy barrier, binding energy between defects, and nucleation and growth processes of the $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ at the GB. The parameters for the nucleation (e.g. $\mathrm { V } { - } \mathrm { V } _ { \mathrm { n } }$ binding energy） are scattered with misorientation angle (Fig. 3(b)), while the structure and kinetics of small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ depend on the GB structure (Figs.3-5). The Vs collected at the GBs of E5(3 1 0)and £5 (2 1 0) develops to a compact 3D structure from a linear structure (Figs. 3 and 3) via the migration of the single V (Fig. 3(a)) or/and small $\mathrm { V _ { n } }$ (Fig. 7(d-f)). The Vs at the other GB either could not bind with each other due to the repulsion between Vs or develop to a 1D structure lying within the GB with low thermodynamic stability (Fig. 3(b). Besides, the growth of a GB void largely relies on $E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ .A bulkVsegreatesteegeticallyriveyedieeten $E _ { V f } ^ { b u l k }$ and $E _ { \scriptscriptstyle { V f } } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle { G B } } ( E b _ { \scriptscriptstyle { t r a p } } )$ . Once the segregated $\mathrm { v }$ contributes to the growth of the stable GB void, it is energetically driven by the energy difference between $E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ and $E _ { V f } ^ { G B \nu o i d } ( E b _ { c l u s t e r i n g } )$ . Near a void of a certain size, $E _ { V f } ^ { G B \nu o i d }$ remains a small scattered value(Fig. 3(f))and is close to zero averagely as predicted by the capillary law [26,54]. Therefore, （20 $E b _ { t r a p }$ and $E b _ { c l u s t e r i n g }$ is mutually restrictedby theequatio of $E b _ { t r a p } + E b _ { c l u s t e r i n g } \leq E _ { V f } ^ { b u l k }$ . Meanwhile, compared to other GBs, the special CSL-GB has a relative small $E b _ { t r a p }$ (Fig. 2(a) and also as illustrated in Fig. 9). As a result, the defects accumulated at the low-angle GB and general high-angle GB with high $E b _ { t r a p }$ would have a small energetic driving force of $E b _ { c l u s t e r i n g }$ to grow (Fig.9).Incontrast, the defects collected at the special CSL-GB have a large $E b _ { c l u s t e r i n g }$ to further grow (Fig.9).The Vs couldfinallyagglomerate to the3DGBvoid that is visible under TEM [3].

# 4.3. Effect of the coupling of grain size with GB character on vacancy accumulation at the GB

The results in Figs. 2-8 are obtained in a single bi-crystal model. The real material contains the GB network composed of different types of GBs,connected by the triple junctions as observed in experiments [2,27,62]. Under certain kinetic conditions,radiation defects trapped at the GB could migrate along the GB network (the small migration energy barrier in Fig. 3(a) provides the kinetic condition), flowing about from one GB to another. Equivalently,the potential wells with diffrent depths are connected (as illustrated in Fig. 9 by the light yellow curve). The V coming from the grain interior initially occupy the wells with a high V energy level tend to move towards the wellwith a low V energy level (as illustrated in Fig. 9 by the yellow arrow).Correspondingly, the V accumulation in the material would be the collective consequence of multiple GBs.

To support such speculation, we designed a system containing two sinks Aand B with two energy levels of the V,as ilustrated in supplementary Fig. S12(a). Sinks A and B could exchange defects with each other via emission, difusion and trap processes in the OKMC model (supplementary Fig. S12(b)). The V was randomly produced in the two sinks at a rate. We found that the Vs in A with a high energy level flowed towards B before its reemission out of A. Moreover,the shorter the distance between Aand B is,the more Vs finally flowed to B (supplementary Fig. S12(b)), implying the grain size effect in the process. Another SCD model where only the emission and trap processes were allowed to occur also confirmed the flow of Vs from A to B (supplementary Fig. S12(c)). Initially, the A and B were loaded with an equal number of Vs. As time passed,the Vs flowed from A to B with a lower energy level, as indicated by the decrease in the V percent in A and the increase in the V percent in B (supplementary Fig. S12(c). Therefore, before the V could be emitted out of a local GB parts with small V-GB binding energy (or equivalently a $\mathrm { h i g h } E _ { V f } ^ { G B } .$ ), the V finds its more stable site at the other GB (Fig.2(a)).We termed this emisson-inhibition behavior as the defects cruise within the GB,which significantly affects the Vaccumulation and distribution in a PC under irradiation.

Next, the cruise condition was derived. As the time for V emission out of the GB $\big ( t _ { e m i s s i o n } = t _ { 0 } e ^ { ( E _ { V f } ^ { b u l k } - E _ { V f } ^ { G B } + E _ { V m } ^ { b u l k } ) / ( k _ { B } T ) } \big )$ islonger thanthatfortedefets movingalongtheGBtofidalowey site in the other GB nearby $\stackrel { \prime } { t } _ { c r u i s e } = L _ { m } ^ { 2 } / \left( 2 D \right) = L ^ { 2 } / \left( 2 D \right) = L ^ { 2 } / \left( 2 D _ { 0 } e ^ { - E _ { V m } ^ { G B } / \left( k _ { B } T \right) } \right)$ with $L _ { { \scriptscriptstyle m } }$ as the distance that a V has wandered during its diffusion process at the GB; here it was given of a typical value of grain size $L$ )， the V emission is inhibited. Thisleads to the followingemission-inhibitioncondition:

（20 $L ^ { 2 } e ^ { ( E _ { V f } ^ { G B } + E _ { V m } ^ { G B } ) / ( k _ { B } T ) } < 2 D _ { 0 } t _ { 0 } e ^ { ( E _ { V f } ^ { b u l k } + E _ { V m } ^ { b u l k } ) / ( k _ { B } T ) }$ . Thephysical insightmaifestlyenompasedinthiseqatiisthe coupling of the grain size $( L )$ with the GB character (the characterization parameters $E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ and $E _ { V m } ^ { G B }$ ） Specifically, the cruise is easy to occur within the GB with a small $E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } ^ { f }$ and $E _ { V m } ^ { G B }$ for a given $L$ or under the condition of a small $L$ for a given GB with certain V properties (supplementary Table S1). For a large $L$ and large $E _ { \scriptscriptstyle V } ^ { { f } }$ and $E _ { V m } ^ { G B }$ , the emission tends to occur compared to the cruise (supplementary Table S1). For the other combinations of $L , E _ { V f } ^ { G B }$ and $E _ { V m } ^ { G B }$ ,it is noteasytoariveatadefinitiveconcusiononterelativeateofcuise and emission (supplementary Table S1). For instance, the V at $\Sigma 5 ( 2 ~ 1 0 ) / [ 0 ~ 0 ~ 1 ]$ tends to cruise along the GB at $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ as the grain size is less than $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ due to its small migration energy barrier of $0 . 3 6 \ \mathrm { e V } ,$ although its formation energy is as high as $1 . 2 2 \mathrm { e V }$ (supplementary Table S1).

The V cruise along the GB network would affect the relation of radiation-performance to the V-GB binding strength in PCs/NCs. The V emission plays a critical role in distinguishing the role of diffrent GBs under irradiation by reducing the trapping efficiency of the GB for the defects in addition to the leakage (Fig. 2(g). As the V emisson is inhibited under a certain condition, a definitive energy-space relation of the magnitude of the V-GB binding energy to the formation of the void-denuded zone near the corresponding GB (e.g. a large V-GB binding energy corresponds to the formation of the void-denuded zone) is broken. This brings about the uncertainty about the GB binding strength and radiation performance, as observed in NC Fe where diferent GBs of the same type exhibit difference in radiation performance at a high temperature[27]. Therefore, at a certain materialparameterand radiation condition， the radiation-microstructure at a local region (particularly for a small grain size) is probably the result of collective behaviors of multiple GBs within a segment of the GB network.

4.4. Implication of the V accumulation mechanism for designing the radiation resistance of a nano-structured metal

Reducing the grain size is a well-known strategy for enhancing the radiation resistance of a poly-crystal metal. Our results provide new atomic insight into radiation damage reduction in NC metals from the view of the GB structure and have implications for designing and optimizing radiation-resistant NCs. The present work reveals several compromise approaches to tailor radiation performance of NCs and juggle the stability of the GB by taking advantage of the character of the GB itself.

To improve the trapping effciency of the defects by the GB, it qualitatively requires the increase in the binding energy of the defects with the GB.For example, the twin boundary binds with the V/SIA weakly compared to other GBs, and consequently the defect accumulation rate in the grain interior is larger than in other GBs at a high temperature due to the V/SIA emission from the GB.To obtain better radiation resistance of NCs at a high $T _ { \mathbf { \delta } }$ ，the fraction of the twin boundary in the nano-structured system should be decreased. At a high radiation dose, the special CSL-GB is not recommended to have a large volume fraction. given the formation of the 3D void at the GB under irradiation (Figs.3 and 4) because of the large energetic driving for the V to be clustered due to the relative high energy level of the Vat the GB (Fig. 2(a) and the flat vacancy potential energy surface at the GB (Fig. 5(a)). Besides, the void would further trap gaseous impurities, forming bubble and promoting boundary embattlement [8,63,64]. The general high-angle GB is recommended to give high volume fraction to improve the radiation-tolerance considering the difficulty in the GB voids formation. The large $E b _ { t r a p }$ gives rise to the high trapping capacity of the GB for the defects. Moreover, together with small $E b _ { c l u s t e r i n g }$ ,the trapped defects are hard to nucleate at the GB or difficult to grow. Meanwhile,in view of the coupling of the grain size with the GB character (supplementary Fig. S12) and Table S1),the GB trapping eficiency is enhanced via the flow of the defects trapped at a CSL-GB with high defects formation energy to the general high-angle/low-angle GBs with low defects formation energy. Therefore, for high temperature application, the general GB with large defects-GB binding energy is suggested to have a large fraction together with a certain fraction of the CSL GB that stabilizes the GB network and meanwhile absorbs defects via defects transport towards the general GB,as pointed in Ref.[2].

There is a balance between the trapping and leakage of the defects near low-angle GBs. Although the low-angle GB shows good trapping ability for the defects (Fig. 2)，the leakage efect emerges in the extremely low-angle GB,resulting in a low trapping eficiency in such system (Fig. $2 ( \mathrm { g ) }$ ). Therefore,the system with a high fraction of the low-angle GB with appropriate angle should have high radiation resistance.

# 5. Conclusions

To sum up, based on the differential evolution, we developed a framework for determining the stable structure of a nano-void. Combining the framework with multiscale simulations, the structure, energetics and kinetics of both the point vacancy (V) and vacancy-cluster at iron (Fe), tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) grain boundaries (GBs) have been systematically studied. We found that the void formation condition at GBs is closely related to the GB structure. At special coincidence-site-latice (CSL) GBs of £5(3 1 0) and £5(2 1 0),the V-GB binding energy is at a medium level, which although causes the Vto be reemitted from the GB but also provides the driving force V-V binding at the GB. V-clusters with discrete size act as stable nucleation centers, developing from a linear configuration to a platelet and finally to a three-dimensional void with low thermodynamic stability. The growth is accompanied by the structural reconstruction of a group of vacancies. The smallvacancy clusters with a relative mobility also contribute to the void formation in addition to the free Vs. The morphology of the V-clusters at the GB relates to both the excess volume and bulk modulus. General high-angle and low-angle GBs trap Vs effciently (the V could be leaked from the exceptionally low-angle GB)，where V-clusters only align one-dimensionally or hardly nucleate.A high-accuracy predictive linear model for the energetics of a nano-void both at the Fe/Mo/W GBs and in the grain interiors has been proposed based on the bonding among the vacancies and neighboring atoms of a nano-void. The model captures the anisotropic feature of a nano-void and reproduces the oscilation in the vacancy energy level near a nano-void, exhibiting superb advantages over widely used continuum model and Wulff construction based model for the energy of a meso-/maco-scopic void. Considering the flow of Vs from the GB with high V formation energy towards the GB with low formation energy,the collctive behavior of GB networks plays a role in GB void formation. To render the poly-crystal Fe/W/Mo more radiation-resistant at a high temperature, the general GB with large defects-GB binding energy is suggested to have a large fraction. The present work provides new knowledge in understanding the GB void formation and enables sound basis for tailoring poly-crystal's radiation resistance to void formation by reducing the fraction of special CSL-GBs.
