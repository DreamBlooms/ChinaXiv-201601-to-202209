Abstract Recent fieldwork at Pleistocene cave sites in the Chongzuo area in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has yielded 33 isolated teeth of fossil hylobatids. Comparisons indicate that the teeth can all be referred to a single species of Nomascus,but the material is insuffcient to assign it to a particular species.The molars are slightly larger on average than those of extant species of Nomascus, but unlike contemporary great apes from the Pleistocene of southern China, the hylobatids do not seem to have undergone a change in dental size through time. Nomascus is not present in the Chongzuo area today, but historical records indicate that the genus may have been widely distributed across southern China in the recent past.

# 1 Introduction

Extant hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs) are currently included in four genera: Hylobates,Hoolock,Nomascus,and Symphalangus (Mittermeier et al.,2013;Roos,2016; Rowe and Myers,2O16). The phylogenetic relationships between these taxa have not been fully resolved (Meyer et al.,2012; Wall et al.,2013; Carbone et al.,2014; Harrison, 2016), but the molecular clock estimates indicate a date of ${ \sim } 2 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 7 \ \mathrm { M a }$ for the divergence of hylobatids from the other hominoids,and ${ \sim } 9 { \mathrm { - } } 5 \ \mathrm { M a }$ for the divergence of the crown hylobatid lineages (Fabre et al.,2009; Matsudaira and Ishida 2010; Thinh et al.,2010; Chan et al.,2010,2012; Perelman et al.,2011; Israfil et al.,2011; Springer et al.,2012; Finstermeier et al.,2013; Carbone et al., 2014; Pozzi et al., 2014).

However, the fossil record of hylobatids is meager (Harrison, 2O16). The family appears to have originated some time during the Early Miocene,but the only known stem hylobatid is Yuanmoupithecus xiaoyuan from the Late Miocene $( \sim 7 - 9 \ \mathrm { M a } )$ ）of Yunnan (Pan,2006; Harrison,2010,2016). Otherwise, fossil hylobatids are known from Pleistocene localities in China,Vietnam, Thailand,Laos,Borneo,Sumatra,and Java (Harrison,2O16).These are mostly isolated teeth, making their taxonomic positions and phylogenetic afinities difficult to determine, but they can generally be assigned to extant genera. Today, gibbons in China (Hylobates,Hoolock,and Nomascus) are restricted to the southwest of the country including Tibet,Yunnan, Guangxi, and on the island of Hainan (Ji and Jiang,2Oo4; Geissmann, 2007; Fan and Huo,2009; Mittermeier et al.,2013; Fan et al.,2017), but during the Pleistocene, and even in historic times, they were widely distributed across southern and central China (van Gulik, 1967; Groves,1972; Gao et al., 1981; Gu, 1989; Geissmann, 1995; Gu et al., 1996; Jablonski et al.,2000; Jablonski and Chaplin,2009; Harson, 2016), gibbons have been largely extirpated in China within the last several hundred years because of the high level of anthropogenic pressure (Turvey et al., 2015).

The best-known hylobatid from the Pleistocene of China is a partial mandible with m2 and m3 from Yanjinggou in Chongqing Municipality (formerly part of Sichuan Province), described by Matthew and Granger (1923) as Bunopithecus sericus.A recent reanalysis of the specimen (Ortiz et al., 2O15) has shown that Bunopithecus represents a distinct genus and is possibly the extinct sister taxon of Hoolock. Other Pleistocene hylobatids from China have been recovered from Yunnan, Guangxi, Hainan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong,and Hunan (Gu et al.,1996; Jablonski and Chaplin, 2009).

Gu (1986,1989) published an account of hylobatid finds from Guangxi obtained under the direction of Pei Wen-Zhong (Pei Wen-Chung) in 1956-1957. The 37 isolated teeth, consisting primarily of upper molars, came from at least eight different cave sites, as well as medicinal supply companies. Gu concluded that the majority of the upper molars resembled Nomascus concolor (sensu lato) in retaining a lingual cingulum, while three upper molars lacking a lingual cingulum were more similar to Hoolock.Extant Hoolock species are distributed west of the Salween River from Bangladesh to western Yunnan, while N.concolor is distributed in Yunnan as well as in Laos and Vietnam.Neither species is currently found in Guangxi, although N. nasutus occurs in western Guangxi.

Recent fieldwork in the Chongzuo area in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (ZAR) has yielded a sample of isolated teeth of fossil hylobatids from eight cave sites that date from Early to Late Pleistocene (Fig.1). Gibbons appear to be a rare component of the Pleistocene primate community in Chongzuo,constituting less than $1 \%$ of specimens (Takai et al., 2014). The aim of this contribution is to describe the newly discovered hylobatids from Chongzuo and to determine their taxonomic positions.

# 2 Materials and methods

The new fossil hylobatid specimens were recovered from cave sites in the area of Chongzuo in Guangxi ZAR. They consist of 33 isolated teeth,mostly upper and lower molars (Fig.2; Table 1). All of the specimens are housed in the collctions of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IVPP). The ages of the specimens range from late Early Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene. The oldest specimens are from Baikong Cave,with an estimated age of ${ \sim } 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (Jin et al., 2014; Takai et al.,2014). The fossils were compared with extant hylobatids from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the Natural History Museum in London, the Kunming Institute of Zoology in Kunming,the Institute of Zoology in Beijing,and the Biology Museum, School of Life Sciences at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou. Metrical and morphological comparisons indicate that the fossils can all be referred to a single species within the genus Nomascus.

Isolated upper and lower first and second molars of hylobatids are difficult to discriminate from each other, and in these instances the fossils are described as M1 or M2 and ml or m2 (see Table 1). In other cases,however, it is possble to assign molars,with reasonable confidence, to their appropriate serial position based on morphological criteria. Measurements of the specimens are presented in Table 1. Molar terminology follows Harrison and Gu(1999) (Fig. 3).

Nomascus (crested gibbons) currently includes seven species, found today in China,

Vietnam, Laos,and Cambodia (Mittermeier et al.,2Ol3). Four species occur in the subtropical and tropical evergreen forests of southwestern China: N. concolor and N. leucogenys in Yunnan, N. nasutus in Guangxi,and N. hainanus in Hainan (Ma and Wang,1986; Fooden et al.,1987; Groves and Wang,1990; Ni and Ma, 2006).

The hylobatids from the Pleistocene cave sites of Chongzuo can be assigned to Nomascus based on the morphology of the upper and lower molars.The small sample of isolated teeth does not permit identification to species.

# 4 Description

Upper premolars are represented by one P3 and two P4s (Fig. 2). P3 is a broad ovoid tooth, with a length-breadth index of 74.2.The protocone is low and rounded,and less elevated than the paracone (the apico-basal height of the protocone is $8 6 . 0 \%$ that of the paracone). The paracone is pyramidal in shape. There is a low transverse crest connecting the paracone and protocone. The mesial fovea is short and relatively broad. The distal fovea is expansive, with slight wrinkling of the enamel surface. There is no lingual cingulum. P3 has two roots.

P4 has a broad ovoid crown, with a length-breadth index of 68.1. The two main cusps, the protocone and paracone, are relatively low. The protocone is only slightly less elevated than the paracone (the apico-basal height of the protocone averages $89 . 9 \%$ that of the paracone). The paracone is pyramidal in shape, whereas the protocone is more conical. The two cusps are situated transversely opposite to each other and are connected by a low and rounded transverse crest. There is no lingual cingulum. The mesial fovea is mesiodistally short, but relatively broad. The distal fovea is more expansive. A shallow median groove transects the transverse crest to connect the mesial and distal foveae. The floor of the distal fovea is smooth and lacks secondary wrinkling. A small rounded tubercle is present on the distolingual margin of the crown in PA 1649.The P4 has two buccal roots and one lingual root.

The fossil sample includes 26 upper molars (Fig. 2). M1 is broader than long and subrectangular, with subparallel mesial and distal margins, a distally receding buccal face, and well-rounded corners. The mean length-breadth index of the M1 is 87.1. The tooth is low-crowned with low and rounded cusps and crests.The protocone is the most voluminous cusp,but less elevated than the paracone and metacone.It occupies most of the mesiolingual quadrant of the occlusal surface. The paracone is a low pyramidal cusp with a bluntly rounded apex.The metacone is subequal in height to the paracone.The apices of the two buccal cusps are located close to the buccal margin of the crown.The hypocone is well developed,but considerably smaller than the protocone.A narrow C-shaped lingual cingulum passes around the mesial and lingual base of the protocone,but it does not continue around the hypocone. A lingual cingulum is present on all Mls,except in PA 1656.The preprotocrista is short and rounded and terminates at the mesial margin. Midway along its length, where it meets the hypoparacrista, there is a low swelling that corresponds to a paraconule. The postprotocrista is low and indistinct.A low,and often poorly developed, crista obliqua links the protocone and metacone. There is no metaconule.A fine groove transects the crista obliqua and passes obliquely from the trigon basin into the distal fovea. The preparacrista is represented by a short and sharp crest that passes mesiolingually from the apex of the paracone to terminate at the mesial marginal ridge. The postparacrista is also sharp and is subequal in length to the preparacrista. The hypoparacrista passes lingually from the paracone to meet the paraconule, where it forms the low distal margin of the mesial fovea. The mesial fovea is small and pitlike.The mesial marginal ridge is low and il-defined. The premetacrista is sharp and passes mesially to meet the postparacrista. The latter two crests are separated by a fine groove that passes from the trigon basin through the buccal notch. A narrow ledge or tiny tubercle on the buccal face of the crown represents a trace of a buccal cingulum in $2 / 3$ of specimens. The postmetacrista is low and arcs distally and lingually to become continuous with the distal marginal ridge. The trigon basin is shallow, but quite expansive,and slightly broader than long.It has traces of a barely discernable Y-shaped fissure pattern, of which the transverse arm passing through the buccal notch is the best developed. Otherwise, the floor of the trigon basin is smooth and has no crenulation.The prehypocrista is low and short and passes mesiobuccally to meet the postprotocrista/The distal fovea is a large triangular basin distal to the crista obliqua.It is about 2/3 of the size of the trigon basin. An oblique groove crosses the floor of the distal fovea from the distal margin of the metacone, passes between the prehypocrista and postprotocrista, to join the groove of the lingual cingulum. The posthypocrista is rounded and arcs distally and buccally to join the distal marginal ridge.M1 has three short roots.

M2 is very similar in morphology to M1. It differs in being larger (the occlusal area is almost $30 \%$ larger on average than M1), the crown is mesiodistally longer in relation to its breadth (the mean length-breadth index is 90.9), the lingual cingulum tends to better developed, and the hypocone is relatively larger and separated from the trigon by a more pronounced groove. The lingual cingulum is present on all M2s, but in a few specimens it is rather weakly developed and not continuous around the protocone (e.g., PA 1642 and PA 1661). In PA 1651, the lingual cingulum continues distally onto the mesiolingual aspect of the hypocone.A trace of the buccal cingulum is present on $40 \%$ of M2s.

M3 has the same basic morphology as M1 and M2.However, it is more variable in shape and size than the other upper molars,and tends to have a relatively shorter crown (with a mean length-breadth index of 83.5),with strong distal tapering,and a hypocone and metacone that are reduced in size compared with the mesial cusps.A well-developed lingual cingulum is typically present, but it is absent in PA 1637.A trace of the buccal cingulum is present in half of the M3s.The crista obliqua is poorly developed or lacking.M3 has three roots,as in M1 and M2,but they are often fused together.M3 is subequal in size to M1,but has a mean area that is about $30 \%$ smaller than M2.The size differential between the upper molars (area of M1:M2:M3) is 77:100:77.

Lower molars are much less common than upper molars in the collection. Only four specimens are represented: one ml or $\mathrm { m } 2$ (Fig. 2: 21, PA 1652), tw0 m2s (Fig. 2: 12,PA 1643;

23, PA 1654), and one $\mathbf { m } 3$ (Fig. 2: 22, PA 1653). PA 1652 and PA 1654 are heavily worn, so details of the $\mathrm { m } 2$ and $\mathrm { m } 3$ are largely based on PA 1643 and PA 1653,respectively. The $\mathrm { m } 2$ is mesiodistally longer than broad (with a mean breadth-length index of 8O.3), subrectangular in outline, tapering mesially, with well-rounded corners.The crown shows a moderate degree of buccolingual waisting (i.e., the crown narrows midway along its length). The buccal and lingual walls of the crown are convex and bulging. The five main cusps are arranged around the periphery of the crown. The protocone is low, rounded and conical. It has short but welldeveloped preprotocristid, hypoprotocristid,and postprotocristid. The size of the hypoconid is similar to the protoconid,and like the later cusp the hypoconid is low and rounded. The prehypocristid and posthypocristid of it are short. The hypoconulid is much smaller than the other buccal cusps.It is situated on the distobuccal margin of the crown, to the buccal side of the longitudinal midline of the crown. There is a slight trace of a buccal cingulid between the hypoconid and hypoconulid in PA 1643,but it appears to be absent in PA 1654. The metaconid and entoconid are pyramidal in shape, and are slightly more elevated than the buccal cusps. The premetacristid arcs mesially and buccally to become continuous with the elevated mesial marginal ridge. The hypometacristid is well developed, and together with the hypoprotocristid, forms the distal wall of the mesial fovea. The two crests are interrupted by a fine longitudinal groove that passes from the talonid basin into the mesial fovea. The mesial fovea is well defined and forms a broad lenticular-shaped furrow. The metaconid and entoconid are widely spaced, with a relatively long postmetacristid. The lingual notch,between the postmetacristid and pre-entocristid, is shallow. The talonid basin is shallow, but expansive. The floor of the basin is smooth and unwrinkled, but indistinct grooves separate the hypoconid from the protoconid and hypoconulid, and pass through the lingual notch, to form a weakly developed Y-shaped groove system. A low, but well-developed crest links the hypoconulid and entoconid to delimit the distal fovea. The D-shaped distal fovea forms a short heel to the crown that protrudes distolingually. The distal marginal ridge bears a prominent tuberculum sextum in PA 1643.

The $\mathbf { m } 3$ is subequal in size to $\mathrm { m } 2$ ，but larger samples and/or associated specimens are needed to confirm whether this is the typical pattern of size differential. The crown is subrectangular, narrowing slightly distally, with a moderate degree of buccolingual waisting,and a V-shaped distal heel. The five main cusps are low and rounded. They are peripherally arranged around the margin of the crown, with only a slight degree of buccal flare.The protoconid is the largest cusp. The preprotocristid is short and rounded,while the postprotocristid is longer and better developed. The hypoconid is slightly smaller than the protoconid. The prehypoctristid and posthypocristid are well developed.A fine groove separates the postprotocristid and the prehypocristid. There is a trace of a cingulid on the buccal face between the protoconid and hypoconid. The hypoconulid is small and situated almost in the midline on the protruding distal margin of the crown. The metaconid and entoconid are widely spaced. The metaconid is slightly more elevated than the protoconid, but it is not as voluminous.The premetacristid arcs mesially and buccally to join the mesial marginal ridge.The hypometacristid meets the hypoprotocristid to form a well-developed distal wall to the mesial fovea.The mesial fovea is broad.The postmetacristid is relatively long and bows lingually. The entoconid is relatively small, with rounded and poorly developed cristids. The pre-entocristid is separated from the postmetacristid by a transverse groove that passes through the shallow lingual notch.The talonid basin is shallow but extensive.Apart from a slight trace of a Y-shaped groove system, the floor of the talonid basin is smooth and lacks secondary wrinkling.The distal fovea is indistinct and restricted to a small pit-like depression on the margin of the crown between the hypoconulid and the entoconid. There is a single root, with mesial and distal lobes.

# 5Comparisons

The isolated teeth from Chongzuo exhibit a marked degree of uniformity in both morphology and size that indicate that they all belong to a single species.The size variation in the upper and lower molars does not exceed the range of intraspecific variation seen in extant hylobatids (Table 2). Unlike some of the other hominoid taxa from the Pleistocene of southern China, such as Pongo and Gigantopithecus (Harrison et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhang and Harrison, 2O17), the hylobatids do not appear to have undergone a change in overall dental size through time.

The fossils share a specialized suite of features of the molars that are characteristic of extant hylobatids. These include: low crowned molars; subrectangular in occlusal outline with rounded corners and buccolingual waisting, low and rounded cusps and crests; peripherally arranged cusps; expansive and shallow talonid and trigon basins; simple groove system with no secondary wrinkling; lower molars much longer than broad; buccal cingulid on lower molars weakly developed; relatively small and distally displaced hypoconulid; widely separated metaconid and entoconid; poorly defined distal fovea on lower molars; M1 and M2 only slightly broader than long; low and poorly developed crista obliqua; relatively small hypocone; moderate degree of size differential between M and M2; M3 relatively small.

Nevertheless, the dentitions of extant hylobatids differ in size and in a number of morphological traits that allow the genera to be discriminated from each other (see Frisch, 1965).These provide a basis for identifying the genus to which the fossils can be assigned. Extant hylobatids display a progressive increase in dental size in the order of Hylobates, Nomascus,Hoolock and Symphalangus.Based on the combined mean areas of the upper molars (the most commonly represented teeth in the fossil sample),the Chongzuo hylobatid is $2 9 . 9 \%$ and $3 2 . 9 \%$ larger than Hylobates moloch and $H y .$ ，lar,respectively,and $1 8 . 5 \%$ smaller than Symphalangus syndactylus.The fossil upper molars have a substantial overlap with the size range of Nomascus concolor,N. leucogenys,and Hoolock hoolock,but they are slightly larger on average ( $6 . 6 \%$ and $6 . 7 \%$ larger, respectively）) than those of $N .$ concolor and $N .$ leucogenys and slightly smaller $( 4 . 0 \% )$ than those of Ho. hoolock. We can estimate,using the Gingerich et al.(1982) formula for average $\mathrm { m } 2$ area, that the Chongzuo hylobatid had an average body mass of about $8 . 7 { \pm } 1 . 0 \mathrm { k g }$

The size difference between M1 and M2 is greater in the Chongzuo hylobatid (the average area of Ml relative to M2 is $7 7 . 2 \%$ ）than the average in extant hylobatid taxa $( 8 4 . 4 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 . 0 \% )$ .It is most distinct from Hylobates spp.,which have a small size differential between M1 and M2 compared to other genera. Sampling is a potential issue,but the M3 also appears to be relatively small in the Chongzuo hylobatid in relation to M2 when compared to extant hylobatids. The mean mesiodistal length of M3 is subequal to the mean mesiodistal length of M1 (with an index of 97.6).This is similar to the proportions in N. concolor (103.4), Ho. hoolock (95.5),and S. syndactylus (94.7). Hylobates spp. have a more reduced M3 ( $( H \nu .$ （20 moloch,93.0; Hy. lar, 93.0; Hy.agilis, 91.5; Hy. klossi,74.1). Unfortunately, the sample of lower molars from Chongzuo is too small to analyze relative size.

The mean breadth-length index of the M1 and M2 (87.1 and 90.9, respectively) indicates that the upper molars of the Chongzuo hylobatid are relatively broad compared with those of extant hylobatids. Nevertheless,M1 is most similar in proportions to those of N. concolor (with a mean index of 89.7), while M2 is most similar in proportions to those of N. leucogenys (with a mean index of 90.5). The mean length-breadth index of $\mathrm { m } 2$ (80.3） in the Chongzuo hylobatid indicates that the lower molars are relatively narrow compared with those of most extant hylobatids, but are comparable to those of S. syndactylus (79.3), N. concolor (80.6), and N. leucogenys (83.3). 2

An important characteristic of the Chongzuo upper molars is the high incidence of a lingual cingulum and the occurrence of a trace of the buccal cingulum. A well-developed lingual cingulum is present in $8 1 . 8 \%$ (18 of 22) of upper molars. According to data compiled by Frisch (1965) for extant hylobatids, this high incidence of occurrence is comparable to that seen in Nomascus spp.(N. gabriellae, $87 . 5 \%$ ; N. leucogenys, $7 2 . 2 \%$ and ${ \dot { H } } { \bar { y } } .$ pileatus $( 7 4 . 2 \% )$ ， whereas in other hylobatid species the cingulum is less fully developed and occurs much less frequently. A trace of a buccal cingulum is present on $5 2 . 4 \%$ of upper molars from Chongzuo (11 of 21).Frisch (1965) reported the occurrence of a buccal cingulum on the upper molars of Symphalangus $( 5 2 . 2 \% )$ and Nomascus $( 6 1 . 7 \% )$ .A vestige of a buccal cingulid is present on three out of the four lower molars from Chongzuo.As noted by Frisch (1965),only Nomascus among extant hylobatids retains a trace of a buccal cingulid on the lower molars.

# 6 Discussion

Given the degree of metrical and morphological uniformity in the sample of hylobatid teeth from Pleistocene cave sites in Chongzuo,the specimens can all be atributed to a single species.Although sample sizes are small, there is no indication that there was any change in dental size through time.The teeth exhibit a suite of specialized features that are characteristic of extant hylobatids, implying that the fossils belonged to a crown member of the clade. The combination of features that the fosils share uniquely with Nomascus indicates that the

Chongzuo hylobatid should be assigned to this genus.As described above, these features include: upper and lower molars similar in size to Nomascus (also Hoolock); M3 subequal in length to M1 (also Hoolock and Symphalangus); upper molars relatively broad; high incidence of a well-developed lingual cingulum on the upper molars (also Hylobates pileatus); trace of a buccal cingulum on the upper molars common (also Symphalangus); lower molars relatively narrow; and presence of a trace of a buccal cingulid on the lower molars.

Unfortunately, the material from Chongzuo is insufficient to assign it to a particular species,so it is referred here to Nomascus sp. It can be distinguished from N. concolor and N. leucogenys, both of which occur today in southwestern China, in having slightly larger teeth and in the proportions of the molars.However, larger samples from Chongzuo,and more extensive comparisons with extant species of Nomascus,especially $N .$ hainanus (from western Hainan) and N. nasutus (from northern Vietnam and western Guangxi), are needed to determine its species affinities.

Currently， Nomascus is not present in the Chongzuo area, but it does occur in nearby areas,including western Guangxi (N. nasutus), Yunnan, Vietnam, and Laos (N. concolor and N. leucogenys), as well as on the island of Hainan (N. hainanus) (Fig. 4). In addition, historical records show that gibbons were more widely distributed in China in the recent past than they are today (van Gulik,1967; Gao et al.,1981; Gu,1989; Geissmann,1995; Zhou and Zhang,2013; Ortiz et al., 2015). Records of hylobatids south of the Xijiang River, are likely atributable to Nomascus,and suggest that the genus was previously widely distributed across southern China (Wang et al.,20o0; Zhou and Zhang,2013).Historical occurrences north of the Xijiang River in central and eastern China possibly represent Bunopithecus,an extinct genus of hylobatid most closely related to Hoolock (Ortiz et al.,2015).

# 7 Conclusions

Recent fieldwork in the Chongzuo area in Guangxi ZAR has led to the recovery of 33 isolated teeth of hylobatids from eight cave sites ranging in age from Early to Late Pleistocene. Morphological and metrical comparisons indicate that the teeth do not exceed the range of intraspecific variation in extant hylobatids,and that they can all be referred to a single species. A combination of features shared uniquely with Nomascus indicates that the Chongzuo hylobatid can be assigned to this genus. These features include relatively broad upper molars with a high incidence of a lingual cingulum and a trace of a buccal cingulum, M3 subequal in length to M1, and narrow lower molars with a vestige of a buccal cingulid. The molars are slightly larger on average than those of extant species of Nomascus. The material from Chongzuo is insufficient to assign it to a particular species of Nomascus. Unlike contemporary great apes from the Pleistocene of southern China, such as Pongo and Gigantopithecus, the hylobatids do not seem to have undergone a change in dental size through time. Although Nomascus is not present in the Chongzuo area today, it is likely that the genus was widely distributed across southern China during historical times. 6

摘要：近年，在对广西崇左地区第四纪洞穴堆积调查的过程中，从年代贯穿更新世的八个地点采集到了33颗长臂猿游离牙齿化石。本文对这些新发现的长臂化石进行了记述，并初步确定了其分类位置。形态和测量的对比表明，这些牙齿不超过现生长臂猿种内变异的范围，且都可以归入一个种内。它们与冠长臂猿属(Nomascus)共有的特征组合表明，这些化石可以归入该属。这些特征包括：上白齿相对宽，舌侧齿带及唇侧齿带痕迹保留率高；M3长度几乎与M1相等；下白齿狭窄，并保留唇侧齿带退化痕迹。崇左地区的化石长臂猿的臼齿平均比冠长臂猿属中现生种类稍显大。但是崇左地区的游离牙齿化石材料提供的证据并不足以支持将其归入该属中的某一具体种类。与中国南方更新世其他同时代的大型猿类猩猩(Pongo)和巨猿(Gigantopithecus)不同，长臂猿的牙齿大小并没有随时间发生变化。尽管冠长臂猿属在现今的崇左地区并没有分布，但是在历史时期该属曾经广泛分布于中国南方地区。 OB
