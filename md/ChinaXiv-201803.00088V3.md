# 1Abstract:

2It has been demonstrated that visual attention is guided by information actively maintained in   
3working memory (WM). However, it remains unknown whether other operations (e.g. inhibition)   
4on WM contents influence selective attention. This issue was investigated in a visual search task   
5where WM contents with either operation (maintenance or inhibition) appeared as distractors in   
6the search display. Behavioral results showed that search performance was slowed down for   
7presenting the maintained contents,but speeded up for the inhibited contents.These results   
8suggested an operation-directed selection of WM contents that visual attention was distinctively   
9influenced by contents with different operation. These observations were further confirmed by the   
10indexes of event-related potentials (ERPs). The inhibited WM contents were suppressed at sensory   
11gating stage (i.e., suppressed Pl amplitude), while the maintained WM contents guided visual   
12attention (i.e., enhanced N2pc amplitude).It seems that results from ERPs and behavior are   
13integrated. The maintained contents guided visual attention that hindered performance of   
14searching a target, while the inhibited contents screened attention that facilitated target searching   
15in the other space. Besides, P3 component indexing updating of WM, which revealed comparable   
16latency both for the maintained and the inhibited WM contents,but with longer latency than the   
17neutral contents. These results suggested that the WM contents with distinct operations were   
18expelled from the focus of executive attention after the onset of the search task, which might be   
19necessary for the WM contents influencing selective attention. The current study reveals that   
20operations of WM contents distinctively affect early selective attention to the matching contents,   
21which sheds some light on the interaction between WM and visual atention.

# 21Introduction

3 Working memory (WM) and attention are closely related. As we know, information   
4maintained in WM has been demonstrated to influence selective attention . However, other studies   
5have revealed no evidence of the influence of WM contents on attention .Thus, further   
6investigation is required to fully understand the controversy over the influence of WM contents on   
7attention and its underlying mechanism.   
8 The finding that the visual attention of a search task is biased to the content maintained in the   
9concurrent WM task, suggests a guidance effect driven by memory content . Additionally, the   
10guidance effect is automatic (Soto,Heinke, Humphreys,& Blanco, 2005) and robust even in   
1lpresence of a salient search target (Soto, Humphreys,& Heinke, 2006). However, other studies   
12have showed no guidance effect of the maintained WM contents when the task of selective   
13attention requires active representation .As we know, the number of items processed with the   
14executive attention is limited (Menneer et al.,2007; Oberauer, 2002), thus in the dual task the WM   
15contents and the search target would compete for attentional focus. In these studies,the target was   
16actively represented , which occupied attentional focus. In the meanwhile,the WM contents that   
17were stored but not under executive atention resulted in diminished or disappeared guidance   
18effect. Above all there were two different (stored and executive) states of WM that the contents   
19under executive state influence visual attention while do not affect attention when merely stored .   
20It seems that the ongoing processing of WM contents with executive attention may be critical in   
2linfluencing visual attention.   
22 As we know, the executive function of the WM involves two distinct operations, maintenance   
23and inhibition .As previous studies focused on the influence of the maintained WM contents on   
24attention,little is known about the selective attention influenced by inhibitory operation of the   
25contents. The inhibitory operation excludes irrelevant information and suppresses distractors,   
26which has been emphasized in numerous studies .Moreover, the top-down suppression of   
27irrelevant information is essential and always online to obtain optimal performance .As an   
28important executive function, the inhibitory operation is an indispensable part to reveal the   
1mechanism of the interaction between selective attention and WM contents.Notably, the   
2investigation whether the inhibited WM contents have an influence on attention can directly   
3examine the previous view, which suggests WM contents under executive attention do affect   
4selective attention (. Additionally, comparison between the selective attention influenced by the   
Sinhibited contents and that by the maintained contents will shed some lights on the relationship   
6between selective attention and WM contents with distinct operations.   
7 As we noted above, it is probably the executive attention operated on the WM contents that   
8influence selective attntion to the matching information in a task of selective attention. However,   
9it still unclear whether the contents under executive attention or contents with specific operation   
10affect selective attention. Herein, two alternative predictions are proposed to resolve this question,   
11the attention-directed guidance and the operation-directed selection. As we mentioned, operations   
12(maintenance and inhibition) of the WM contents involves executive attention, thus that the   
13contents are processed within the attentional focus and easily gain control of visual attention .   
14Based on this view, the attention-directed guidance suggests that the matching contents under   
15executive attention willbe more accessible and attract visual attention in the other task. Therefore,   
16the attention-directed guidance predicts that both the maintained and the inhibited WM contents   
17capture visual attention, demonstrating analogous pattern of selective atention. However, the   
18operation-directed selection acknowledges the accessibility of contents under executive attention,   
19and further posits that the specific operation (maintenance or inhibition) on executive attention   
20determines the selective attention of perceptually matching contents. In other words, the   
2lmaintained content is attended and the inhibited content is suppressed when they appeared in the   
22visual field. This view predicts that the contents with maintained operation and the contents with   
23inhibitory operation have distinct pattern of selective attention.   
24 In the current experiment, a dual-task incorporating WM task and visual search task was   
25utilized, modified from Olivers et al. (2006).In the WM task, two colors were memorized first,   
26and then a cue pointed the color to be maintained and the other to be inhibited.The stimuli were   
27presented on the bilateral visual fields in the search array, which enabled an examination on   
28lateralized processing indicative of the selective attention (Heinze et al.,1990; Luck and Hillyard,   
291994a). Additionally, the cued or uncued WM contents might appear on the opposite field to the   
1search targets.A baseline (neutral condition) was established when there was no memory item in   
2the search array. Applying a moderate duration between the WM task and the search task suggest,   
3the cued and the uncued WM contents were supposed to be differently operated (maintained and   
4inhibited, respectively) under executive atention. If the attention-directed guidance determines the   
5influence of WM contents on attention,both the maintained (cued) and the inhibited (uncued) WM   
6contents wil guide attention and impair search performance. Alternatively, the operation-directed   
7selection forecasts an adverse efect for the presence of the maintained WM contents and a   
8beneficial effect for the inhibited WM contents in the search task.   
9 In addition to the behavioral measurement, electrophysiological method was also employed   
10to further reveal the neural mechanism of selective attention influenced by WM operations.   
11Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded while healthy human participants were   
12performing the dual-task. Early ERP (event-related potential) components (e.g., P1 and N1) were   
13adopted to index the selective attention influenced at sensory gating stage .The attentional   
14guidance effect could be reflected by the N2pc component ， which is sensitive to spatially   
15selective attention .Additionally,P3 was also examined as the late attentional components .

# 162Method

# 172.1 Participants

18 Twenty-four (11 females,aged between 18 and 25 years) right-handed college students at   
19Southwest University were recruited in return for a monetary reward. Allparticipants reported   
20normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal color vision. Informed consent was   
21obtained from them all. This study was approved by the Review Board of Southwest University   
22(Chongqing, China) for Human Participant Research.

# 232.2 Apparatus, stimuli and procedure

24 E-Prime software (version 1.1, Psychology Software Tools Inc.Pittsburg, USA) was used to   
25control the stimuli and collect responses. The stimuli were displayed on a 17-inch monitor with a   
26resolution of $1 , 0 2 4 \times 7 6 8$ pixels and a refresh rate of $8 5 \mathrm { H z }$ . The distance between the monitor and   
27participants was approximately $7 0 \mathrm { c m }$

1 Stimuli were presented on a gray background (RGB values: 128,128, 128). The color patch 2was $1 . 6 ^ { \circ } \times 1 . 6 ^ { \circ }$ visual angle.Ten colors were chosen from the Munsell's color system consisted 3of five principal hues (red, yellow, green, blue and purple). The hue,brightness and chroma of 4these colors were listed in Table 1. The specific hue and value were kept nearly constant. The 5chroma of each color varied between 8 and 12. Note that these colors used in the present 6experiment were only approximations of Munsell's original colors due to screen limitations. The 7vertical line was $0 . 8 ^ { \circ } \times 0 . 1 ^ { \circ }$ visual angle, and the target was tilted $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ . In the search array, four 8lines were presented and each was put on the middle of the color patch as an object. 9 The trial sequence of this experiment was shown in Figure 1. Each trial began with a black 10 cross presented for $5 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ . After that, a memory array with two colors was presented for 1500 $1 1 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ , and participants were required to remember both colors.The color patches were presented on 12 the middle line that deviated $1 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ up and down from the center fixation. Following that, a mask 13 array of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ contained two Mondrian patches, which presented on the same locations as color 14 patches in the memory array. At the last $2 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$ of the mask array, an arrow was added on the 15fixation,introducing distinct attentional operations (i.e.,maintenance and inhibition)on the 16 memory colors.The arrow pointed to the color to be tested and was maintained,but the uncued 17 color was irrelevant and supposed to be inhibited. The inter-stimulus interval between the mask 18 array and the search array was randomized between $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$ and $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ . The search array 19 contained four objects on separate quadrants in an imaginary clock face with a radius of $6 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ 20 The colors of objects were different in the left and in the right visual field, but identical in each 21 visual field. Participants responded to the position of the target (i.e., in the left or right visual 22 field). After an interval of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ , the test array with two different color patches was displayed 23 horizontally, in which a response about the presence of the cued color was required.Both the 24 search array and the test array was presented until a response or $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ . The inter-trial interval 25 was 500 ms.

# 262.3 Assignment of stimuli

27 Locations of stimuli were controlled with balance. In the mask array, an upward arrow   
28 appeared on half of the trials and a downward arrow appeared on the remaining half trials. In the

1 search array, the targets presented on four quadrants evenly. The cued color and the uncued color 2 were located in the left and the right visual fields for equal probability.The directions of the cue 3 corresponding to the top and botom locations of the target were counterbalanced and so were the 4 left and right positions of the search target corresponding to that of the cued color in the test. 5 The colors presented in an array were controlled for some purposes. In the memory array, 6 colors were chosen from two adjacent hues (red, yelow, green,blue and purple) to ensure visual 7 similarity. Thus, the memory colors were supposed to be maintained with visual representation. 8 In the search array, when one of the colors in the memory array appeared, the other color was the 9 most dissimilar one to it. Otherwise,the two colors dissmilar to both memory colors were lO displayed. Additionally, the luminance contrast and color distance in the search array were 11 approximately equated to avoid difference in physical attributes. In the memory test, two similar l2 colors were chosen to ensure visual representation of the memory colors .

# 13 2.4 Design

14 Since the interaction between operation of visual WM content and visual attention is our   
15 main concern, the relationship between the WM contents with distinct operations (the maintained   
16 and the inhibited contents) and the search target was manipulated. Specifically, one of the   
17 memory colors appeared in the search array on half trials,among which the cued color (cued   
18 condition) and the uncued color (uncued condition) was presented in the opposite visual field to   
19 the target in equal probability. On the other half of trials, other colors displayed in the search   
20 array as neutral condition. Therefore, the Search condition (cued condition, uncued condition and   
21 neutral condition) was established. The proportions of the cued condition, the uncued condition   
22 and the neutral condition was 1:1:2, to avoid any bias to the memory items.   
23 For the memory test, the cued color and the unced color was presented with equalization   
24 and independent of each other. Thus, four combinations constituted by Cued color (presence,   
25 absence) and Uncued color (presence, absence) were generated.   
26 Participants in the practice session did 24 trials with feedback of the memory test. After the   
27 practice, the experiment with 24 blocks of 24 trials was performed. Trials were assigned with   
28 pseudo randomness. Each block took 2-3 minutes,and participants had a self-determined rest.   
1 The whole experiment requires 60-70 minutes.The data from the practice sesson were excluded   
2 from analysis.

# 32.5 EEG recordings and pre-processing

4 The electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded using a Brain Products system (band 5pass $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { H z }$ , sampling rate: ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { H z }$ , notch off), connected to a 60 scalp Ag-AgCl electrodes 6placed according to the international 10-20 system. All inter-electrode impedances were kept 7below $5 \mathrm { k } \Omega$ with the references on $\operatorname { F C z }$ and a ground electrode on AFz. The electro-oculograms 8(EOGs) were simultaneously recorded from four surface electrodes, which were placed over the 9upper and lower eyelids and next by the outer canthus of the left and right eye to monitor ocular l0movements and eye blinks. The EEG and electro-oculograms (EOGs) signals were amplified l 1using a DC voltage.

12 EEG data were pre-processed using EEGLAB 11.0 (Delorme & Makeig, 2004). Continuous   
13EEG recordings band-pass filtered between l and $4 0 \mathrm { H z }$ .EEG epochs were segmented in 1200 ms   
14time-windows (pre-stimulus 200 ms and post-stimulus $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } } \mathrm { { . } }$ ）on the search task,and baseline   
15corrected using the pre-stimulus time interval. EEG epochs were then visually inspected and trials   
16with considerable artifacts resulting from gross movements were removed. Trials contaminated by   
17eye-blinks and other movements were corrected using an independent component analysis (ICA)   
18algorithm (Delorme & Makeig,2004; Delorme, Sejnowski, & Makeig,2007). In alldatasets, the   
19individual eye movements, which showed a large EOG channel contribution and a frontal scalp   
20distribution, were clearly seen in the removed independent components (ICs). After ICA and an   
2ladditional baseline correction,EEG trials (at least 110 trials in each condition) were re-referenced   
22to the bilateral mastoid electrodes.

# 23 2.6 Data analysis

24 Analyses of behavior data.In the analyses of the search task, data from one participant was   
25excluded due to excessive errors (exceeding three standard deviations). Trials with wrong   
26responses or RTs exceeding $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ , were removed (about $4 \%$ of all trials) in the analysis of   
27mean RTs. The one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carred out on the   
1mean RTs and accuracies for the Search condition.All data were analyzed in the memory test with   
2a 2 (Cued color: presence,absence) $\times 2$ (Uncued color: presence, absence) repeated-measures   
3ANOVA.   
4 Analyses of ERP data. The statistics were based on 23 participants with normal errors.   
5Single-participant averaged waveforms in each condition were averaged to get the grand averaged   
6waveform, which were used to obtain the group-level scalp topographies for each condition. The   
7P1, N1, N2pc and P3 components were analyzed in the search task.   
8The P1 showed a max activation around $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ at the lateral parietal-occipital scalp   
9topography. At these electrodes (P1/2, P3/4, PO3/4,and PO7/8),P1 peak amplitudes were detected   
10as the max positive deflection in the time window of 60-130 ms. The 4 (Electrode: P1,P3,PO3,   
11and $\mathrm { P O } 7 ) \times 2$ (Hemisphere: left,right) $\times 3$ (Search condition: cued, uncued and neutral) repeated  
12measures ANOVA was executed on peak amplitudes and latencies.   
13N1 peak amplitudes were detected at the occipital electrodes (Oz, O1/2,POz and PO3/4),   
14with negative reflection within the time window of 160-200 ms.A 6 (Electrode: Oz, O1/2, POz   
15and $\mathrm { P O } 3 / 4 ) \times 3$ (Search condition: cued, uncued and neutral) repeated-measures ANOVA was   
16carried out on N1 peak amplitudes and latencies.   
17 The N2pc component was sourced at the pooled occipital electrodes (PO7/PO8) and obtained   
18by subtracting the ipsilateral waveforms from the contralateral waveforms of the target.For   
19statistical purposes, the N2pc waveforms were computed with a 100-ms pre-stimulus and $4 0 0 \mathrm { - m s }$ （20   
20post-stimulus interval with the pre-stimulus period as a baseline (Figure 4). The mean area   
2lamplitudes across 170-250 ms were compared between the contralateral and ipsilateral electrodes   
22with paired-sample t test for each condition. And the N2pc amplitudes in Search condition were   
23obtained by averaging area amplitude across170-250 ms, which was analyzed with the one-way   
24ANOVA.   
25The P3 peak amplitude were detected at four posterior midline electrodes (CPz,Pz, POz, and   
26Oz) in a 280-400 ms time range. The two-way (Electrode $\times$ Search condition) repeated-measures

27ANOVA was executed.

28 The above statistical analysis was carried out with Statistical Product and Service Solutions   
29(version 13.0, SPSS Inc.). Greenhouse-Geisser correction for degrees of freedom was used   
1 whenever the assumption of sphericity was violated $( \mathfrak { p } < . 0 5 )$ . For multiple comparisons, p values   
2were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction.

6 Figure 2 depicted the mean RTs and error rates in the search task. Mauchly's test of sphericity   
7on RTs was statistically significant $( \chi ^ { 2 } _ { 2 } = 1 2 . 6 8 , p = . 0 0 2 )$ on Search condition, so that a validated   
8degrees of freedom was used. There was a significant main effect of Search condition $\cdot F _ { 2 , 4 4 } =$   
$9 3 5 . 0 0 , p < . 0 0 1$ ， ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { = } 0 . 6 1 \$ ） on the measures of RTs. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the RTs in   
10the cued condition were $3 9 \mathrm { m s }$ slower than those in the neutral condition $( t _ { 2 2 } = 5 . 3 7 , p < . 0 0 1 , d =$   
111.12),and 49 ms slower than those in the uncued condition $( t _ { 2 2 } = 7 . 0 2 , p < . 0 0 1 , d = 1 . 4 6 )$   
12Interestingly, performance in the uncued condition was significantly better for $1 0 \mathrm { m s }$ than that in   
13the neutral condition $( t _ { 2 2 } = 2 . 6 0 , p = . 0 4 8$ $d = 0 . 5 4$ ). These results indicated that the appearance of   
14the cued color opposite to the target hindered the selection for the target, while the presence of the   
15uncued colors opposite to the target facilitated visual search. Otherwise,variances were equal in   
16accuracies $( \chi ^ { 2 } _ { 2 } = 2 . 2 8 , p = . 3 2 )$ , and no main effect was observed because of high accuracy (over   
$1 7 9 9 \%$ in all conditions $( F _ { 2 , 4 4 } = 1 . 7 0 , p = . 1 9 )$ ：

# 183.1.2 Memory test

19 The overall mean accuracy in memory task was $8 4 . 5 \%$ , and the mean reaction time was 831 $2 0 \mathrm { m s }$ . Analyses on the mean accuracy showed main effects of the Cued color $( F _ { 1 , 2 3 } = 2 9 . 9 7 , p < . 0 0 1$ $2 1 { \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 5 7 )$ with better performance for the presence than the absence of the cued color ( $\stackrel { \ r } { t } _ { 2 3 } = 5 . 4 7$ ， $2 2 p < . 0 0 1$ ， $d = 1 . 1 2 \$ ),and the Uncued color $( F _ { 1 , 2 3 } = 1 7 . 5 8 , p < . 0 0 1$ ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { = } 0 . 4 3 )$ with worse 23performance for the presence than the absence of the uncued color $( t _ { 2 3 } \mathrm { = } - 4 . 1 9 , p = . 0 0 1 , d = - 0 . 8 6 )$ 24Moreover, the interaction between the Cued color and the Uncued color was significant $\stackrel { \cdot } { F _ { 1 , 2 3 } } =$ 257.49, $p = . 0 1 2$ ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { = } 0 . 2 5 )$ . The breakdown of this interaction showed a simple effect of the

1Uncued color when the cued color was absent in the test $( F _ { 1 , 2 3 } = 1 5 . 8 2 , p = . 0 0 1$ ， ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { = } 0 . 4 1 \$ ).But 2no simple effect of the Uncued color was observed when the cued color was present ( $F _ { 1 , 2 3 } = 2 . 7 5$ $3 p = . 1 1 \rangle$ . These results demonstrated that uncued color might be mistook as the cued color for its 4absence.

5 Correct responses were entered in analysis of the mean RTs.A main effect of Cued color was   
6observed $( F _ { 1 , 2 3 } = 1 6 . 0 2 , p = . 0 0 1$ ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { = } 0 . 4 1 \$ ） with faster response for the appearance than absence   
7of the cued color $( t _ { 2 3 } { = } - 4 . 0 0 , p { = } . 0 0 1$ ， $d = - 0 . 8 2 \$ ). The main effect of the Uncued color was also   
8observed $( F _ { 1 , 2 3 } = 4 . 2 9 , p = . 0 5$ ， ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { = } 0 . 1 6 )$ that RTs were slower with its presence than RTs with its   
9absence $( t _ { 2 3 } { = } 2 . 0 7 , p = . 0 5 , d = 0 . 4 2 )$ . An interaction between the Cued color and the Uncued color   
10was also demonstrated $( F _ { 1 , 2 3 } = 1 8 . 9 2 , p < . 0 0 1$ ， $\eta _ { p } { } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 5 )$ . The follow-up tests revealed   
1l significant simple contrasts of the Uncued color, reversed for the presence $( t _ { 2 3 } = - 2 . 5 0 , p = . 0 2 ,$ （20 $d =$   
12-0.51) and the absence of the cued color $( t _ { 2 3 } = 4 . 5 1 , p < . 0 0 1$ ， $d = - 0 . 9 2$ ). In accordance, the results   
13of accuracy and RT were consistent, which indicated that the presence of the uncued color had an   
14influence on the detection of the cued color. Even though, the two colors were clearly   
15distinguishable.

19and all interactions $( p < . 0 5 )$ , the significant values were reported based on the validated degrees

# 104Discussion

11 The current study examined the influences of WM contents with distinct operations on   
12selective attention. In this experiment, one of two memorized colors was cued to be maintained   
13and the uncued one was supposed to be inhibited. These different processes exerted on WM   
14contents have shown to differently modulate behavior and ERP indices of selective attention in a   
15concurrent visual search task. Specifically, the behavioral responses to the search task were   
16slowed down when the distractors were the maintained (cued) WM contents while speeded up   
17when the distractors were the inhibited (uncued) WM contents, relative to performances in neutral   
18condition. Consistently, these results were reflected in the results of ERPs indexing selective   
19atention at early stage. An inhibitory process marked by smaller Pl amplitude was observed in the   
20search task with the inhibited WM contents.Furthermore, the N2pc amplitude was larger with the   
21maintained WM contents, indicative of a guidance efect. Herein, taking results of behavior and   
22attention senstive ERPs together, we found that the selective attention was influenced by both the   
23maintained and the inhibited WM contents. However, these influences by the maintained and the   
24inhibited contents were different, corresponding to their separate operations during WM   
25processing. Therefore, the operation-directed selection was supported that suggests the   
26perceptually matching content is selected depending on its operation under executive attention.   
27Interestingly, we found that the selective attention reflected in P3 as an attentioanl updating at late   
28stage was equally modulated by the maintained and the inhibited WM contents.

1 Behavioral performance showed that the selective attention was separately modulated by the 2maintained WM contents and the inhibited WM contents because of different operations. Note 3that, both of the WM contents were memorized initially but then were cued to distinct operations. 4Thus, it was the operation of the contents that made them under executive attention and easily 5accessible, which is assumed to influence the attentional selection .Moreover, the influences by 6the maintained contents and the inhibited contents were different, demonstrating an adverse effect 7with the maintained WM content and a beneficial effect with the inhibited WM content. The 8distinct patterns of attentional effects were in line with the prediction of the operation-directed 9selection but not the attention-directed guidance. Therefore, we suggest that contents under lOexecutive atention affected visual atention depending on their ongoing operations. The present l1 study goes beyond previous views by demonstrating that distinct operations of information l2separately determined selective attention to the matching content.

13 The results of ERPs further provided evidence to elucidate the mechanisms of the operation  
14directed selection.As for P1 component, it reflected inhibitory process of selective attention at the   
15sensory gating stage .The inhibitory mechanism to filter out interference has been suggested in   
16previous studies (Luck et al.,1994: Hillyard et al.,1998), with smaller P1 amplitude for targets   
17presenting in the suppressed area. In current experiment, a smaller amplitude was observed in   
18search array with the inhibited WM contents relative to that with the maintained WM contents and   
19the neutral contents. The suppressed P1 component for the inhibited WM contents indicated that   
20the contents were filtered out from visual attention in the search array. As the suppression of the   
2linhibited WM contents, searching scope was narrowed down, facilitating search and showing a   
22beneficial effect. Therefore,the electrophysiological modulation of the inhibited WM contents   
23was consistent with the beneficial effect on behavior. Furthermore,the inhibitory mechanism to   
24filter out specific content has also been observed during WM representation or utilizing a   
25template for rejection ,the processes of which resemble to the transfer of inhibitory operation of   
26WM contents to perceptually matching contents. Thus, the P1 modulation implies that the   
27inhibited WM contents were suppressed like the operation during WM.   
28 Notably, the attentional guidance by the maintained WM contents was indicated by the N2pc   
29amplitude, as what the previous studies have demonstrated . Here, the N2pc component was much

llarger in search array with the maintained content than that with the inhibited content and neutral 2contents, without difference between arrays with the inhibited contents and neutral contents. Thus, 3the guidance effect has been observed for the maintained WM contents but not for the inhibited 4WM contents. The guidance effect implies that the maintained WM contents captured visual 5attention,replicating the result of a related study by Kumar et al. (2009). As a result of attentional 6guidance, the maintained WM contents induced more distraction, hindering search for a target in 7the opposite place and resulting in an adverse efect on behavior. According to Desimone (1996), 8the search template is also kept in WM, thus that the attentional guidance by the maintained WM 9contents may resemble the selective attention directed by an active search template.Actually, the 10attentional guidance by the WM contents in the current dual task is different from that by a search 1ltemplate, because the former could be detrimental to the search task.Hence, in current study there 12might be a competition for selective atention after the guidance as Duncan and his cooperators 13have revealed .It is worthy to mention that a preliminary inhibition of the memory-relevant 14contents is inapposite in a dual task .Thus, the larger N2pc amplitude elicited by the maintained 15contents should reflect a competition for selective attention between the search target and the 16maintained WM content, revealing a re-deployment of atention to search target after a prior 17guidance in a neuroimaging study . In the meanwhile, it was reasonable with no sign of atentional 18guidance of the inhibited WM contents, since they were just suppressed at the sensory gate (P1 19component). Taking together, the behavior performance is in accordance with the early ERP 20evidence,ilustrating that it is the operation of the WM contents determines the selective attntion 2lof matching contents. We suggest that the operation-directed selection is probably due to a transfer 22of the inner operation to the perceptual selection on the same contents.

23 Moreover, findings of P3 amplitude provided convincing evidence to support that both the   
24maintained and the inhibited WM contents were under executive attntion. The P3 component is   
25suggested to reflect a revision of mental representation induced by previous exposures in   
26memory .The present results showed that the P3 amplitudes with the maintained and the inhibited   
27WM contents were equal, but larger than that with the neutral contents. The larger P3 amplitude   
28indicated that the visual scene with WM contents were updated, without distinction between the   
29maintained and the inhibited contents. The updating of visual attention might be attributed to a

lrequirement of shifting attentional focus , which had been occupied by WM contents previously. 2Hence, we considered that both the maintained and the inhibited WM contents were under 3executive attention,and that the different influences on selective atention of these contents can be 4resulted from their distinct operations. Notably, the attentional shifting,resulted from refreshing 5the visual context in atentional processing ,helped to focus on the current search task. 6 However, the conclusion of operation-directed selection obtained here seems contradictory 7with a similar experiment by . Their results demonstrate an atentional guidance by the maintained 8WM items but no influence on selective atention by the inhibited WM items.The disrepant 9results between ours and could be due to difference of difficulty of the WM task. As we see, the 10WM stimuli used by Qlivers et al.(2006) were of great similarity, which required precision visual 11representation and enhanced cognitive load. Thus, the high cognitive load leads to a loss of 12cognitive control, which may have hindered appropriate suppression of the task-irrelevant 13information (Lavie,2000; Lavie et al.,2004; Rissman, Gazzaley, & D'Esposito,2009; Roberts, 14Hager,& Heron,1994; Sandrini,Rossini,& Miniussi,2008).In the case, insufficient inhibitory 15operation of the uncued contents might account for the null effct on visual atention. 16Nevertheless, in the current study we utilized relatively easy task and ensured the maintaining and 17inhibitory operation of the WM contents,showing distinct patterns of influence on selective 18attention and supporting the operation-directed visual selection. 19 The view of operation-directed visual selection contains two aspects, an influence of WM 20contents under executive attention and a selective attention determined by the operation of the 21contents. Firstofall,the attentional allocation is influenced bycontents under executiveatttion, 22even for memory being retrieved .In other words,the once maintained contents or priming items 23cannot influence visual atention, since they are not under executive attention at that moment . 24However, executive attention is not so obvious in dual task, since the limitation of capacity and 25competition between goals,usuall allwing the immediate goal to be attended in the focus of 26attention .Thus, facing an immediate search task,this influence occurs only when the attentional 27focus is dominated by the WM contents; otherwise, it wil be absent. Secondly, we go beyond this 28view and propose that the direction of the attentional influence (attend vs.suppress) is determined 29by operation on the executive attention of the WM contents.
