# Summary

Conversion of nongrain biomass into liquid fuel is a sustainable approach to energy demands as global population increases. Previously,we showed that iron can act as a catalyst to enhance the degradation of lignocelllosic biomass for biofuel production. However,direct addition of iron catalysts to biomass pretreatment is diffusion-limited,would increase the cost and complexity of biorefinery unit operations and may have deleterious environmental impacts. Here,we show a new strategy for in planta accumulation of iron throughout the volume of the cell wall where ironacts as a catalyst in the deconstruction of lignocelllosic biomass.We engineered CBM-IBP fusion polypeptides composed of a carbohydrate-binding module family 11 (CBM11)and an iron-binding peptide (IBP)for secretion into Arabidopsis and rice cellwalls.CBM-IBP transformed Arabidopsis and rice plants show significant increases in iron accumulation and biomass conversion compared to respective controls.Further, CBM-IBP rice shows a $3 5 \%$ increase in seed iron concentration and a $40 \%$ increase in seed yield in greenhouse experiments. CBM-IBP rice potentially could be used to address iron deficiency,the most common and widespread nutritional disorder according to the World Health Organization.

# Introduction

As the world population continues to increase and fossil resources are finite,alternative feedstocks for fuels and other chemicals are being developed to meet this growing demand (Hill et al.,2006). Nongrain lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks,such as rice straw, aresustainable resources because theyare renewable,abundant and are not used as human food (Himmel et al.，2oo7).In addition to fuel，low-cost lignocellulosic biomass can be converted into high-value products in selective biorefinery processes. Unfortunately，thermal and chemical conversions require highenergy inputs and the efficiency of biochemical conversion is limited by biomass recalcitrance.A strategy to reduce initial energy inputs and facilitate the deconstruction of cell walls (Wei et al.，2O11) involves use of transition metal catalysts，such as $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ .However，pretreatments in which the metal catalysts are directly added to biomass will increase unit operations and costs, and the high concentrations of metal required to penetrate the cell walls present potential environmental problems of water usage and disposal.

Furthermore,a method that increases iron accumulation in rice grain is important to combat iron deficiency in human populationswhich rely on this low-iron grain for subsistence (Meng et al.，2005;Goto et al.，1999). Transition metal uptake,transport and homeostatic mechanisms are tightly coordinated,and efforts to engineer iron-enriched crops for food and metal hyperaccumulating plants for phytoremediation have achieved limited success after 25 years of research (Palmer and Guerinot, 2009)．Translation of ${ \mathsf { N i } } ^ { 2 + }$ hyperaccumulation mechanisms to $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ 1 ${ \mathsf { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\mathsf { M n } ^ { 2 + }$ accumulation is limited as cytosolic $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ ${ \mathsf { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\mathsf { M n } ^ { 2 + }$ levels required for effective cell wall catalysis are toxic to living plants.Therefore, the challenge is to avoid cellular toxicity and，at the same time，accumulate transition metals throughout the volume of the cell wall,both to reduce biomass recalcitrance in vegetative tissues and to increase iron concentration in grain.Here,a combination of strategies was used to tailor plants for increased transition metal concentration to facilitate direct catalysis of cell wall deconstruction.An unexpected consequence of this approach was enhancement of iron in rice grains.

# Results and discussion

# Design and synthesis of CBM-IBP constructs

Figure 1a shows the approach used to increase transition metal concentration in planta for efficient cell wall deconstruction by fusing an iron-bindingpeptide (IBP)，a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) to bring the IBP near carbohydrate bonds in the cell wall and a signal peptide (SP) so that the SP-CBM-IBP polypeptide would be secreted to the cell wall. Several constitutive and inducible constructs were designed that contained the SP-CBM-IBP polypeptide and different tags,for example haemagglutinin (HA) or a fluorescent protein (Figure 1a and Figure S1a). Two iron-binding peptides (IBP) were synthesized and analysed formetal binding:a minimal ferritin-binding peptide based on the ferritin monomer and a synthetic iron-binding motif based on the blood iron-binding peptide that we had previously isolated and found that it bound iron across a wide range of pH.Both the synthetic blood IBP DLGEQYFKG (Lee and Song,2009) and the ferritin IBP LAEEKREGYER (LaWSOn etal.，1991) bound iron in vitro at cytosolic pH ${ \sim } 7 . 0$ and apoplastic pH ${ \sim } 5 . 5$ (Figure 1b,c). An extensin secretion signal peptide (SP) (De Loose et al.,1991) Was chosen for secretion of the SP-CBM-IBP polypeptide into the cell wall.Signal peptides have been used to successfully secrete carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) in poplar,Arabidopsisand rice (Cho and Cosqrove,200o; Choi et al.,2003).

Clostridium thermocellum CBMs were used to target the IBPs to carbohydrate components of the cell wall.The pool of CBMs is diverse,with each CBM targeting different polysaccharides in the cell wall (Boraston et al.，2004; Shoseyov et al.,2006).Five CBMs with an SP N-terminal fusion and a C-terminal pHinsensitive fluorescent protein mCherry (Shaner et al.，2005) were expressed in Arabidopsis under control of a constitutive promoter (SP-CBM-mCherry)and analysed for secretion (Figure S1b).Of the five，three showed intracellular fluorescent signals,and CBM11，which binds primarily 1,4-β and 1,3-1,4-β mixed linked glucans,and CBM22，which binds primarily 1,3-β and 1,4-β glucans (Hashimoto,2oo6),showed signals localized to the cell wall， indicating that these two CBMs were successfully secreted，although some intracellular signal was observed (Figure S1b).Higher fluorescent signalswere observed inthe SP-CBM11-mCherry plants compared to SP-CBM22- mCherry plants (Figure S1b); therefore，CBM11 was used for further analyses. IBPs were then fused to the secreted CBM11 (SP-CBM11-IBP) to target the iron to carbohydrate bonds in the cell wall as shown in Figure 1a.Modelling of SP-CBM11-IBP docking to cellulose microfibrils suggests that iron targeting to cell walls is possible (Wu et al.,2013),although this remains to be demonstrated in planta.CBM11 fused to the minimal ferritin iron-binding peptide (SP-CBM11-FIBP) did not show obvious signals in the cell wall in Arabidopsis thaliana (data not shown）and was not analysed further.Secreted CBM11 fused to the synthetic blood iron-binding peptide and HA (SPCBM11-IBP-HA)，hereafter called CBM-IBP，showed a range of relative expression levels (Figure S1c).Whereas metal hyperaccumulating plants often show reduced growth (Palmer and Guerinot，20o9)，a wide range of CBM-iBP expression levels had no detrimental effect on plant growth when expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 1d and Figure S1d).

# CBM-IBP localizes to cell walls in Arabidopsis

To determine whether CBM-IBP was secreted to the cell wall, CBM-IBP localization was analysed under the control ofa tamoxifen-inducible promoter (CBM-IBP-Dendra2）or a constitutive promoter (CBM-IBP-HA).No autofluorescence in roots andonly chlorophyll autofluorescenceinhypocotylsand cotyledons were observed in uninduced plants (Figure 2a,d,g). Afterinduction， CBM-IBP-Dendra2 signals were observed in roots(Figure 2b,c)， cotyledons (Figure 2e,f） and hypocotyls (Figure 2h),and apoplastic localization was observed following plasmolysis(Figure 2c,f,h).Uponinduction， theintracellular localization was most pronounced in younger tissue， that is cells close to the root tip (Figure 2c)，compared to mature tissue，consistent with the greater activity of the secretory system in actively growing cells (De Loose et al.，1991;Hall and Cannon,2002; Lamport et al.,2011); unsecreted CBM-IBP may bind to the cell wall during senescence.Immunohistochemistry of constitutively expressed CBM-IBP-HA also showed apoplastic localization (Figure 2j,l)，and no signal was detected in plants transformed with the empty vector (Figure $2 \mathrm { i } , \mathrm { k } ,$ .Further，X-ray fluorescence microscopy，in which each pixel is analysed for elemental fluorescence,showed that iron signals were localized to the cell walls of the epidermis as well as the vascular tissue in mature stems (Figure $2 \mathsf { m } , \mathsf { n } ,$ ；calcium(Figure 2m,n)and zinc (not shown) signals were observed in the cell walls throughout the stem.Iron quantification using an absolute scale could not be obtained due to variations in section thickness.These data suggest that CBM-IBP could bind the iron at the cell wall and suggested the possibility of iron deposition in the cell wall may haveoccurred via the secretory pathway.Whereasboth inducible and constitutive expression resulted in CBM-IBP accumulation at the cell wall， plants with constitutively expressed HA fusion polypeptides were chosen for further analyses due to tamoxifen toxicity.

# CBM-IBP enhances iron concentration in Arabidopsis

ArabidopsisthalianaplantsexpressingCBM-iBPshowed increased iron concentration in shoots and seeds and enhanced biomassconversion in shoots(Figure 3). CBM-iBPshoots contained $6 0 \% - 7 0 \%$ more iron compared to wild-type control plants $\cdot P < 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 3a).Perls' Prussian blue stainingwas used to visualize iron accumulation directly in planta.CBM-IBP Arabidopsis leaves showed more staining than controls,indicatingincreased iron accumulation (Figure 3b).To determine whether the iron-binding peptide was responsible for the increased iron concentration,the DLGEQYFKG residues in CBMIBP Were mutated to VLGVIYIVG(CBM-IBP4)which abolishes the iron-binding motif $\underline { { \mathsf { E } / \mathsf { D } \times \mathsf { X E } } }$ (Fang and Wang,2o02;Lawson et al.，1991)．CBM-IBP△ Arabidopsis lines with a range of expression levels comparable to the CBM-iBP lines were analysed (Figure S2a and Figure S1c).CBM-IBP4 plants had iron concentrations comparable to wild type (Figure 3a and Figure $\mathsf { S 2 b } )$ ；therefore，the CBM-IBP，but not CBM-IBP△，binds ironand increases iron amounts in planta.

The iron accumulation in seeds was analysed to assess whether CBM-IBP could also enhance iron accumulation in other tissues. Iron isnaturally highin Arabidopsis seeds,and CBM-/BP-2 seeds showed increased iron accumulation compared to wild type ${ ' } P = 0 . 0 0 2 { \mathrm { . } }$ ，and CBM-IBP-1and CBM-IBP-3weresimilartowild type $( P = 0 . 0 9$ 、 $P = 0 . 1 1$ ，respectively；Figure 3c)． However, significantly more iron accumulated in seeds when CBM-IBP wasexpressed in the oligopeptide transporter 3-2 (opt3-2) mutant background $\langle P < 0 . 0 1$ ，Figure 3c) which has reduced iron concentration in seeds (Stacey et al.，2oo8).These results indicate that CBM-IBP-mediated iron increases are distinct from OPT3-dependent iron accumulation in Arabidopsis seeds (Stacey et al.，2oo8)，and indicate that CBM-IBP can increase iron accumulation in plants that have low amounts of iron.

# CBM-IBP enhances biomass conversion in Arabidopsis

Previously，we developed a dilute acid/Fe²+ pretreatment for biomass that increased the yield of sugar monomers (Wei et al., 2011)． Moreover，the hot water/F $\mathsf { \bar { e } } ^ { 2 + }$ and hot water/Fe³+ pretreatments were also effective in releasing more simple sugars than hot water alone pretreatment (Kamireddy et al., 2013；Liu et al.，2009；Zhao et al.，2011).Arabidopsis plants expressing $C B M - 1 B P$ orCBM-IBP& were analysed using this process，that iswithout adding exogenous $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ CBM-IBP shoots yielded $20 \%$ more glucose and $1 5 \%$ more xylose comparedtocontrols $\langle P < 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 3dand Figure S2c).The enhanced release of sugar monomers can be attributed to iron bindingby IBP,as CBM-/BP4 shoots showed glucose and xylose release comparable to wild type $\langle P > 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 3d and Figure S2c)．Total cellulose and ethanol-soluble and ethanolinsoluble sugars in CBM-iBP biomass were not different from wild type and CBM-IBP△ controls $\cdot P > 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure S2d-f). Therefore，afunctionaliron-bindingmotifinCBM-IBPis necessary to enhance cell wall hydrolysisin $C B M - 1 B P$ plants. Thisisalso consistent with iron reduction in biomass recalcitrance under acidic conditions in pretreatments (Wei et al., 2011）and demonstrates that iron accumulated in planta appears to function in the same manner.

# CBM-IBP enhances iron concentration and biomass conversion in rice

There is some question whether the success of iron accumulation inincreasing monomer sugar release in Arabidopsis would transfer to grasses.Arabidopsis cell wallsare typical of dicotyledonous species,but the cell walls of grass species such as rice contain additional noncellulosic polysaccharides.Further，Arabidopsis uses a reduction strategy for iron uptake,while rice uses a combination of reduction and chelation (Palmer and Guerinot, 2009).Wild-type rice was transformed with CBM-iBP to test whether the same in planta technology can be translated to crop rice.Homozygous transgenic rice lines that expressed CBM-IBP wereselected foranalyses (Figure 4aand Figure S3a).CBM-IBP rice shoots had ${ \sim } 6 0 \%$ increase in iron accumulation compared to wildtype $( P < 0 . 0 5$ ,Figure4b),similar to the increase observed in CBM-IBP Arabidopsis.Perls' Prussian blue staining also showed increased iron levels in CBM-IBP rice rootsand leaves (Figure 4c), withstaining most pronounced in xylem cells (Figure 4d). Without exogenous $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ in the pretreatment,release of glucose and xylose from CBM-IBP-2 rice shoots Was comparable to CBMIBPArabidopsis plants，yielding $2 5 \%$ more glucose and $1 5 \%$ more xylose compared to controls $\langle P < 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 4e).Total cellulose，ethanol-soluble and ethanol-insoluble sugars in CBMIBP rice biomass were similar to wild type ( $\cdot P > 0 . 0 5$ Figure $\mathsf { S 3 b } , \mathsf { c } ,$ d).Further, the amount of glucose released was greater in the 2M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-soluble fraction and reduced in the nonsoluble pellet $( P < 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 3c).As rice and Arabidopsis have similar cellulose structuresand differential effects of CBM11 expression in rice and Arabidopsisare unlikely, CBM-IBP△analyses werenot repeated in rice.These results demonstrate that iron accumulated in planta efficiently facilitates biomass deconstruction，although the effects of iron on the synthesis of other polymers to enhance saccharification cannot be ruled out.

# CBM-IBP increases yield and iron concentration in rice seeds

As iron hyperaccumulation may reduce growth and/or yield,the growth of CBM-iBP rice plants Was analysed in detail.Rice expressing CBM-/BP senesced slightly earlier than wild type based on the colour and chlorophyll levels of older flag leaves when the panicles were fully filled (Figure 4a; Figure S3f).The CBM-IBP rice homozygous lines had reduced height compared to wild type (Figure 4aand Figure S3e).Whereas short stature isa favourable trait for grain production in rice,it is not for biomass production. However，CBM-IBP rice plants developed more tillers $\langle P < 0 . 0 5$ Figure 5a),and,offsetting their short statures，the shoot dry weight of CBM-IBP-1 and CBM-IBP-2 rice Was greater than wild type $\cdot P < 0 . 0 5$ ,Figure 5b).Plants in the greenhouse were grown at the same densityas in the field,and tillering of wild-type rice in the greenhouse was comparable to field-grown rice. CBM-IBP rice plants also produced ${ \sim } 4 0 \%$ more seeds per plant compared to wildtype $\langle P < 0 . 0 5$ ,Figure 5c),which will be re-evaluated in field trials.Chlorophyll quantificationswere greater in CBM-/PB mature green flag leaves and less in yellow flag leaves compared to wild type $\langle P < 0 . 0 5$ ,Figure S3f).The increased chlorophyll concentration in the CBM-/BP flag leaves is consistentwith increased seed yieldand iron concentrations in biomass and seeds (described below). Rice tillering is modulated by strigolactones,and DWARF 27(D27)，an iron-binding isomerase that converts trans- $\beta \cdot$ carotene into 9-cis $\beta$ -carotene in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway (Alder et al.,2012; Lin et al.,2009). Increased iron may affect D27 activity and/or function and subsequently influence tillering activity，although how iron may affect D27 or other factors regulating tillering is unknown.Furthermore，iron promotes chlorophyll biosynthesis (Chereskin and Castelfranco et al., 1982)which may have increased the biomass yield in transgenic plants;however,such hypotheses need to be tested in future experiments.

The iron accumulation in CBM-IBP dehusked brown rice seeds (brown rice，also known as unmilled orunpolished rice)was analysed to determine whether an iron increase similar to CBMIBPArabidopsis occurred.CBM-IBP rice seeds had $3 5 \%$ (CBM-IBP1) to $3 7 \%$ (CBM-IBP-3) more iron thanwild-type seeds $\stackrel { \prime } { P } < 0 . 0 5$ Figure 5d;TableS1).CBM- ${ \cdot } I B P$ rice contained $1 7 - 2 3 \ \mu 9$ iron/g dry weight，which iscomparable to iron accumulationinrice overexpressing soya bean ferritin( $1 2 - 2 0 ~ \mu \ g$ iron/g dry weight, Quetal.，20o5）orhydroponically grown NFPbrown rice overexpressing two transgenes,nicotianamine and ferritin in the endosperm ( $1 7 \ \mu \mathrm { g }$ iron/g dry weight，Wirth et al.，2009).Iron levels in milled rice (white rice or polished rice) increased \~twofold in $C B M - 1 B P - 1$ and\~three-fold in CBM-IBP-2 and CBM-IBP-3 comparedtowild type $\cdot P < 0 . 0 5$ Figure 5e).The iron increase in CBM-IBP white rice $( 4 - 6 ~ \mu 9$ iron/g dry weight) was comparable to NFP white rice $( { \sim } 7 \ \mu \ g$ iron/g dry weight).The average seed weight and size (length,width,area) were similar among CBM$I B P$ and wild-type rice grains $\langle P > 0 . 1$ ，Figure S4a-e)，and therefore，the average iron amount per grain was greater in

CBM-IBP than wild type.Furthermore,peptide-chelated iron may be more bioavailable for absorption (Lee and Song，2009). Analysis of the ion profile in both Arabidopsis and rice seeds indicated some increases in other metal ions for which there are toxicity concerns,such as Cd,Co, Cr and Cu (Table S1). However, the concentration of the metal ions measured was below the toxic limits set by FDA(www.fda.org) based on consumption of $1 \ \mathsf { k g }$ dry brown rice per day.For reference，the average consumption is ${ \sim } 0 . 5 { \sim } 0 . 6 ~ \mathsf { k g }$ rice per day by individualsin the highest rice-consuming countries.If implemented in the field, cultivar selection for biofuelsand/or biofortification characteristics should be considered because of genetic variation in mineral concentration among rice cultivars $( 2 - 4 5 ~ \mu \ g$ iron/gdryweight brown rice, Zheng et al.,2010).

Here，a triple fusion polypeptide was used successfully to accumulate iron in the cell wall while avoiding cellular toxicity: (i) the signal peptide from a native cell wall extension protein to provide efficient secretion (De Loose et al.，1991),(ii) a synthetic blood iron-binding peptide to efficiently bind iron and (ii) CBM11 to direct the IBP-bound iron to cell wall polysaccharides to prevent re-uptake of free iron into the cell (Palmer and Guerinot,2009) resulting in enhanced biomass conversion.In contrast to the millimolar ironadded to feedstock postharvest (Wei et al.,2011), CBM-IBP plants contain micromolar iron that efficientlyand effectively increases saccharification yield.These results indicate that in planta iron targeting to the cell wall can effectively increase saccharification yields in biochemical conversion processes.The release of simple sugars in CBM-iBP ricewasat least comparable to the pretreatment of corn stover in Wei et al. (2011),suggesting that the plant engineering approach is more efficient than the conventional iron loading approach.The current cultural practices of growing rice,which includes foliar iron applications，would not need to be altered to realize increased iron concentration in CBM-IBP rice.Further,it appears that CBM-IBP rice more efficiently utilizes the iron in the foliar spray than wild type based on the increased amounts of chlorophyll and iron in leaves.It is important to note that biomass recalcitrance varies among different plant tissues，for example leaves versus stems and apical versus basal stems.Some of the observed differences in pretreatment and enzymatic digestibility could be attributed to differences in CBM-IBP plant growth compared to the controls (i.e.shorter stature，thicker stems,more tillers).

It would be unrealistic to consider that straw from CBM-/BP rice would be the only part of the plant used,especially with the need to feed a growing global population.An unintended consequence of expressing CBM-IBP was a ${ \sim } 4 0 \%$ increase in seed yield and $3 5 \%$ increase in seed iron accumulation.Given that a $3 \%$ increase in yield is considered significant (Baldwin et al.，2012), wewill determine whether the enhanced traits are observed under field conditions.The increased iron accumulation in brown and white rice could address iron deficiency,with an apparently lowpotential for toxicity from other metals.Allergens from the peptides would also be of concern.The IBP has no predicted antigenic determinants,and CBM11 has five; for comparison,rice $\mathfrak { a }$ -expansin (CBMs are homologous to expansins) has seven (http://imed.med.ucm.es).Taken together, this technology could beused for both enhanced conversion of rice straw biomass to biofuel and increased iron-enriched grain yield to support both global energyand food demands.

# Experimental procedures

# Constructing the binding model of CtCBM11-IBP to cell wall

Theatomisticmodel of the CtCBM11 (Clostridium thermocellum CBM11) was constructed using the reported NMR structure 2LR0 (Viegas et al.，2013).The blood iron-binding peptide was initially generated asa $\mathfrak { a }$ -helixand attached to the C-terminal end of CtCBM11.The parameters of the $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding site in ferritin monomer (Lawson et al.，1991)，for example the distances between $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ and oxygen atoms，were used to restrain the binding site in the blood Fe-binding peptide. An energy minimization of CtCBM11-IBP system Was then conducted for 2000 steps of steepest decent minimization followed by 2000 steps adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) minimization using CHARMM (Brooks et al.,20o9).A previously equilibrated cellulose $1 \beta$ microfibril (Beckham etal.,2012;Payne et al.,2011;Wu et al.，2013)was used to construct the CtCBM11-IBP/cellulose complex.The microfibril was composed of four layers，which consist of 3,4,5 and 6 cellulose chains from the top layer to the bottom layer，respectively.Each cellulose chain has 16 glucose residues.As CtCBM11is characterized as a type B subfamily of CBMs and binds to a single cellodextrin chain, the CtCBM11 was placed on the hydrophobic surface with a single'edge'cellodextrin chain bound to its binding cleft. The CHARMM22 force field parameters (Brooks et al.，2009;MacKerell et al.，1998)were used for the peptide and the C35 carbohydrate force field parameters (Guvench et al.，20o8，2009)were used for the cellulose during energy minimization. $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ and two oxygen atoms at the $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding site were harmonically restrained.A final minimization of the entire system was run for 1ooo steps of steepest decent minimization followed by 10oo steps ABNR minimization.

# Iron-binding peptides and assays

The peptides DLGEQYFKG (ferritin iron-binding peptide，FIBP, molecular weight 1057)and LAEEKREGYER(blood iron-binding peptide，BIBP，MW 1380)were synthesized by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (www.crbdiscovery.com). For IBP-binding assay at $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 7 . 0$ phosphate buffer，free $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ forms insoluble compound with phosphate and removed by centrifugation. IBPbound Fe in the supernatant was determined by orthophenanthroline which results a red solution when binds with $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ .The iron-binding assayat $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 7 . 0$ was performed in $5 0 0 ~ \mu \ L$ binding solution $[ 2 0 \mathrm { \ m u \ M E S \ p H \ 7 . 0 } ;$ （2 $0 . 5 \mathrm { \ m w } \mathsf { F e C l } _ { 2 }$ ；peptide $( 2 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ phosphate buffer pH 7.0): 0,5,10,15,and $2 0 ~ \mu \iota$ $H _ { 2 } O$ up to $5 0 0 ~ \mu \ L ,$ 2 mM final phosphate] at room temperature for $1 \ h$ with gentle shaking according to Lee and Song (2oo9).The binding solution was spun at $3 5 0 0 \times { \mathfrak { g } }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ to remove precipitates.The iron concentration in the supernatant was determined using a colorimetric method (adapted from Harris, 1998)by orthophenanthroline which results in a red solution when binds with $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ .Hydroquinone is added to prevent oxidation of $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ to $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ .One hundred $\mu \updownarrow$ supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube to which $2 0 ~ \mu \updownarrow ~ 1 \%$ hydroquinoneand $5 0 ~ \mu \updownarrow 0 . 2 5 \%$ orthophenanthrolineand $8 3 0 ~ \mu \updownarrow ~ \mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O }$ were added to make the final volume $1 \ m L$ and the absorbance at $5 1 0 \ \mathsf { n m }$ was determined.The iron-binding assay at $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } ~ 5 . 5$ was performed as above with the following modifications due to the solubility of the iron at $\mathsf { p H } 5 . 5$ ： $1 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ binding solution $( 2 0 \mathsf { m o M M E S p H 5 . 5 } ; 2 . 5 \mathsf { m o M F e C l } _ { 2 } )$ was used for the assays and $2 0 ~ \mu \iota$ supernatant was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane.The membranes were washed with $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ MES $\mathsf { p H } ~ 5 . 5$ buffer twice for 5 min each time.The membranes were developed in $5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ developing solution ( $1 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ $1 \%$ hydroquinone， $2 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } ~ 0 . 2 5 \%$ orthophenanthroline）and imaged，and the colour intensity was analysed with ImageJ software (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).

# Constructs

All primers used in this work are listed in Table S2.The extensin signal peptide (SP) and the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) cassettes SP-CBMs-mCherry and SP-CBM11-Roo were constructed using overlapping PCR primers.After digestion with BamHl and Sacl，the SP-CBMs-mCherry and $S P .$ -CBM11-R00 cassetteswereclonedintopCAMBlA2300(www.cam bia.org/daisy/cambia/585).The $S P$ -CBM11-IBP(blood iron-binding peptide) cassette called CBM-IBP was amplified from pCambia2300-SP-CBM11-Roo using the primers CaccSP- ${ \cdot } 5 ^ { \prime }$ and BIBP- $3 ^ { \prime }$ and cloned into Gateway entry vector pENTR/TOPO (Invitrogen, www.invitrogen.com).The CBM-/BP4 cassette containing the mutated blood iron-binding motif (BiBP4)was amplified from pENTR-CBM-IBP using the primers CaccSP- ${ . 5 ^ { \prime } }$ and $B | \mathsf { B P } \Delta \mathsf { - } 3 ^ { \prime }$ and cloned into pENTR/TOPO.The constructs were analysed by PCR and restriction digests，and were sequenced using the M13 forwardprimer.The plasmids pENTR-CBM11-IBP/IBP4were cut with Mlul,and the CBM11-/BP/iBP4cassettesWere transferred to pGWB14 (Nakagawa et al.，2007) (with C-terminal HA fusion) and/or the oestrogen-inducible vector $p / S T O 4$ (modified from pEarleyGate101 with N-terminal oestrogen-inducible elements: FMV:NEV+ 1Ox NiP promoter and C-terminal Dendra2 fusion) (Jäsik et al.,2013) using LR reactions (Invitrogen).

# Plant transformation

Arabidopsis was transformed with the constructs by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent，1998).The resulting transformants were selected on $0 . 4 5 \%$ phytagel plates containing quarterstrength Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salts, ${ \mathsf { p H } } 5 . 5$ at $2 2 ^ { \circ } C$ （204号 $1 4 \textsf { h } 1 0 0 \ \mu \mathsf { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { s }$ supplemented with kanamycin $( 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L } )$ 1 hygromycin $\langle 5 0 \mathrm { \ m g / L } \rangle$ orphosphinothricin $( 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ ，forBar resistance)，and genotyped by PCR.T1 heterozygous and T2 or T3homozygous CBM11-IBP/IBP& Arabidopsisplantswere selected and analysed with kanamycin and hygromycin and PCR genotyping.CBM11-IBP-Dendra2Arabidopsisplantswere selected with phosphinothricin and BASTA spray.Rice was transformed with CBM11-IBP and CBM11-Roo using Agrobacterium-mediated method described previously (Nishimura et al., 2006)．Briefly，seeds from O.sativa var.japonica‘Nipponbare' were surface-sterilized and germinated on N6 medium [Chu's N6 medium with vitamins supplemented with $2 { \mathrm { ~ m g / L } }$ 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), $0 . 1 \ { \mathfrak { g } }$ myo-inositol, $0 . 3 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / \mathsf { L }$ casein hydrolysate, $2 . 8 7 8 \ 9 \ \mathsf { L }$ -prolineand $3 \%$ sucrose,pH,5.8,solidified with 4 g phytagel] to initiate calli.After incubation for 3-4 weeks at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ，light $\langle 1 1 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { s } \rangle$ ，actively growing calli (yellowish white) were collected and proliferated on the same medium to be used for Agrobacterium cocultivation (3 days,at $2 8 ^ { \circ } C$ in dark). Infected calli were washed with sterile water and selected with N6 medium with $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ hygromycin and $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ carbenicillin for 3-4 weeks at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ，lightat $1 1 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / s$ .Hygromycinresistant cali were transfer to rice shoot regeneration medium $4 . 4 ~ 9 / \mathsfit { L }$ MS salts, $2 . 0 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ 6-benzylaminopurine, $3 0 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathsf { L } }$ sucrose, $7 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathsf { L } }$ TC agar)，and regenerated shoots were transferred to full-strength MS medium with $2 \%$ sucrose and $0 . 7 \%$ agar. Twenty transgenic lines for Arabidopsis and more than ten lines for rice were generated.Three lines were continued to homozygosity for detailed analyses.T3 homozygous transgenic plants were selected with hygromycin $( 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L } )$ and confirmed by PCR genotyping.

# Plant growth conditions

Arabidopsiswild-typeand CBM11-FIBP/CBM-IBP seedlingswere grown as above except as indicated for specific treatments. Arabidopsiswild-type and CBM11-FIBP/CBM-IBP plantswere grown in the greenhouse in soil under natural light conditions, except the day length was extended to $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ with HID lights $( 1 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \Sigma )$ inthe winter. See www.hort.purdue.edu/ hort/facilities/greenhouse/hlaTech.shtmlformoreinformation. Plants were watered with $1 / 1 0$ strength Hoagland's nutrient solution (Barac et al.，2004) supplemented with $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ iron every2weeks orwith $1 / 1 0$ strength Hoagland's nutrient solution supplemented with a $1 0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ iron solution (Sequestrene $3 3 0 \ \mathsf { F e } ,$ Becker Underwood，INC，Ames，IA） foliar spray once every 2 weeks (3 times in total).The floral spray was developed as a more environmentally friendly iron application method for biofuel feedstock production. Rice wild-type and CBM-iBP seedlings were grown on $0 . 4 5 \%$ phytagel plates,containing quarter-strength MS，pH 5.5, $2 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ $1 4 \ h$ light $\langle 1 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { s } \rangle$ except as indicated for specific treatments.Rice wild-type and CBM-IBP plantswere grown in the greenhouse in calcined clay (Profile Greens calcined clay granules in 9-cm pots) with drip irrigation under semi-dry and natural light conditions,and in the winter, the day length was extended to $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ with HID lights $\scriptstyle ( 2 5 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } /$ s).The rice plants were watered and fertilized with 1/10 Hoagland'ssolution supplemented with $5 0 ~ \mu \mu$ ironor 1/10 Hoagland's solution supplemented with a $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ iron foliar spray every 2 weeks after flowering (three applications in total). Before harvest，tiller numbers were counted and plant heights were measured from the root-shoot junction to the tip of the tallest flag leaf. Plant biomass and seeds were harvested and dried in a laminar flow hood at room temperature for 1 week,and dry weights were recorded.The CBM-IBP Arabidopsis and rice plants contained similar amounts of iron in both soil and foliar Fe application,so the iron concentration was independent of the fertilization method.

# Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis and rice

Total RNA was isolated from 7-days Arabidopsis or 1O-days rice seedlings using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the vendor's manual (Qiagen，www.qiagen.com). RNA was quantified and treated with TURBO DNA-freeM DNase (Ambion RNA by Life Technologies,www.invitrogen.com).First-strand cDNA was synthesized from three $\mu \ g$ of total RNA with the SuperScript@IIl reverse transcription kit followed by reverse transcription,according to the vendor's manual (lnvitrogen).Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (BioRad，www.Bio-Rad.com） and GoTaq@ $\mathsf { q P C R }$ Master Mix (Promega,www.promega.com).See Table S2 for the primers.

# Iron staining

Arabidopsis and rice seedlings were vacuum-infiltrated with Perls' Prussian blue stain solution (equal volumes of $4 \%$ [v/v] HCl and $4 \%$ [w/v] K-ferrocyanide) for 15 min.The plant samples were incubated for3O min,rinsed three timeswith waterand stored in

$70 \%$ ethanol. The staining was imaged using a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss,Jena,Germany).Stained samples were imbedded in Neg-5O frozen section medium (Richard-Allan Scientific,Kalamazoo,Ml).100 $\mu \mathrm { m }$ -thick sections were prepared inMicrom HM550 (Microm International GmbH，Walldorf, Germany) and imaged using a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena,Germany).

# Immunohistochemical localization,immunofluorescence and fluorescent protein localization studies

Arabidopsis 5-d seedlings were prepared for immunolocalization asdescribed in Peer etal. (Peer etal.，2Oo9) Briefly，seedlings were fixed in $4 \%$ $p$ -formaldehyde in microtubule-stabilizing buffer(MTSB) solution $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ PIPES, $5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ EGTA,and $5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ MgSO4）and $5 \%$ DMSO for $1 \ h$ .They were washed with $\mathsf { M T S B } + \mathsf { 0 } . 1 \%$ Nonidet P-40 for $1 0 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ (five times).The seedlings were permeabilized for $1 \ h$ in $10 \%$ DMSO and $1 \%$ Nonidet P-40 and then blocked with $3 \%$ BSA in MTSB for $3 h$ .The seedlings were incubated overnight $( 3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ with anti-HA $( 1 : 2 5 0 ,$ Santa Cruz Biotechnology,www.scbt.com),in $3 \%$ BSA in MTSB.They were then washed for $1 0 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ (six times) in $0 . 1 \%$ Triton $x - 1 0 0$ for $1 0 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ (three times) in MSTB,and then incubated for $3 h$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ in goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 $( 1 : 2 5 0 )$ in $3 \%$ BSA/ MTSB.The seedlings were washed in $M { \sf T S B } / 0 . 1 \%$ Triton $x - 1 0 0$ and then in water for 10 min each (five times). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss，Jena，Germany).The following settings were used: for Alexa Fluor 488:488 nm argon laserat $3 . 5 \%$ ，pinhole $9 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ，emission $4 9 3 \mathrm { - } 6 3 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ ，gain650, pixel dwell $6 . 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { s } ;$ for YFP: $5 1 4 \ \mathsf { n m }$ argon laserat $1 3 \%$ ，pinhole $9 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ，emission $5 1 9 - 6 2 1 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，gain 833，pixel dwell time $3 . 1 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { s } ;$ and for mCherry: $5 4 3 \ \mathsf { n m }$ argon laser at $60 \%$ ，pinhole $4 5 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,emission 578-696 nm, gain 821,pixel dwell time $6 . 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { s }$ Theoestrogen-inducible CBM-IBP-Dendra2 Arabidopsis plants weregerminatedon $\%$ strength MS plates.Three-day-old seedlings were transferred to plates with $1 / 4$ strength MS containing $4 ~ \mu \mu$ 4-hydroxy tamoxifen for $1 6 { \ - } 4 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .CBM-IBPDendra2 signalswereanalysed using $4 8 8 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ argon laserat $2 4 \%$ 1 pinhole $9 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } } .$ ，emission 493-577 nm，gain 820，pixel dwell $3 . 1 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { s }$

# X-ray fluorescence microscopy

Four-week-old bolted Arabidopsis plants were sprayed with iron solution $( 0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m } )$ once.Inflorescence stems were dissected and imbedded in $5 \%$ agar when cooled to ${ \sim } 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ： $1 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ -thick sections were prepared using a TPl Vibratome 1ooo.Sections were sent to Argonne National Laboratory for analysis according to method described in Inouye et al. (2014).

# Elemental analyses

Arabidopsis and rice shoot tissues were harvested when fully senescent，air-dried and shaken to remove the seeds.Dry Arabidopsis and rice shoots were ground twice to pass through a 20-mesh (1-mm） screen using a Wiley Mill.The husk was removed from dry rice seeds to obtain brown rice;brown rice was polished to whited rice according to Wirth et al. (2oo9).Both brown and white rice grains were ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.An aliquot of the ground samples was usedto measure the metal concentrations with modifications to published procedures (Stacey et al.，2oo8;Vansuyt etal.，2007; Wei and Layzell,2006). Briefly, $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m g }$ of dry, ground sample was digested in 0.4 mL $2 5 \%$ (v/v)nitric acid (Trace Metal Grade,

Fisher Scientific),at $7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ,overnight.After digestion,the extract was diluted to $5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ withfresh Millipore (Synergy Water Purification System) de-ionized $H _ { 2 } O$ (the final nitric acid concentration was $2 \%$ ）andanalysed quantitatively for ironand other metal ions using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by the Chemical Analysis Laboratory at the University of Georgia.Trial experiments indicated that the recovery rates for the ions during the nitric acid extractions were between $9 7 \%$ and $102 \%$ ；thus，the original data have been presented without adjustments.

# Biomass pretreatment and conversion to sugars

Arabidopsis and rice shoot tissueswere harvested when fully senescent,air-dried and shaken to remove the seeds,ground twice to pass through a 2O-mesh (1-mm) screen using a Wiley Mil and then tested for total sugar release through hot water pretreatment combined with enzymatic hydrolysis,using a highthroughput method.The advantage of using a high-throughput (HTP)type pretreatment procedure is that it can process large numbers of biomass samples with smallsample sizes to test sugar release (Decker etal.，2009；Selig etal.，2010;Studer et al., 2010,2011).Briefly，5 mg of ground biomass from each plant line was weighed manually in sample replicates into individual wells on 96-well Hastelloy plates;water was added,the plates sealed,clamped and subjected to hot water pretreatment and cosaccharification,usinga high-throughput analytical process developed by NREL. The hot water pretreatment was conducted at $1 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $1 7 . 5 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ . Following hot water pretreatment, the seals were pierced with a 96-point punch to allow the addition of buffer and enzymes.The pH of pretreated biomass slurry was buffered at $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 5 . 0$ by addition of 1 M sodium citrate buffer containing the desired enzymes (as described below) to ensure an optimal condition for enzymatic saccharification.A total volume of $4 0 ~ { \mu \ L }$ of buffer and enzyme was added to each well; the enzyme used was Novozymes CTec2 (3 mg enzyme/g biomass). The 96-well plate was resealed,and the enzymatic cosaccharification was carried out at $4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $7 0 ~ \mathrm { h }$ .After the cosaccharification,the sugar release was analysed using glucose oxidase/ peroxidase (GOPOD) assay for glucose and xylose dehydrogenase (XDH)assay forxylose asdescribed previously (Gao etal.,2013; Selig et al., 2010).

# Rice grain size analyses

100-grain rice seeds were collected from each plant and dry weights determined on a balance.Scanned pictures of collected rice grains were analysed using SmartGrain software program (Tanabata et al.,2012).

# Cellulose and sugar quantifications

Arabidopsis and rice shoot tissues were harvested when fully senescent，air-dried and shaken to remove the seeds，ground twice to pass through a 20-mesh (1-mm) screen using a Wiley Mill.To determine cellulose concentration of rice straw and Arabidopsis shoot biomass, $1 5 ~ \mathsf { m g }$ samples were weighed into conical glass centrifuge tubes with screw caps, three biological replicates each.Afteradding $3 m L$ of a mixture of acetic acid/ water/nitric acid (8/2/1,v/v/v),the suspension was incubated at $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $9 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ with occasional mixing (Updegraff，1969). After cooling,the tubes were centrifuged at $2 5 0 0 \ g$ for $3 \min$ and the supernatant discarded.The pellet was washed three timeswith water，centrifuged at 25oO g for3 min and water discarded each time.The pellet was resuspended in $3 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ water and $2 5 0 ~ \mu \iota$ was taken for phenol-sulphuric assay (Dubois et al., 1956); $2 5 0 ~ \mu \ L$ of $5 \%$ phenol was added to each tube and mixed; and $2 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf S } { \sf O } _ { 4 }$ wasadded and vortexedto mix. Samples were incubated overnight atambient temperature and read at $5 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ compared to cellulose standards (Sigmacell; Sigma).

To remove soluble sugars, $0 . 5 \ { \mathfrak { g } }$ dry biomass was incubated with 10 mL $50 \%$ ethanol at $7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 20 min.The supernatant Was dried under evaporator and sugar content was determined by phenol-sulphuric acid assay (Dubois et al.，1956).The pellet was washed once with $50 \%$ ethanol and five times with water. Alcohol-insoluble residues were freeze-dried and used for neutral sugar analysis.

Neutral sugar composition was analysed according to Gibeaut and Carpita (1991). Briefly，wall material (alcohol-insoluble residues)washydrolysedin $2 N$ trifluoroacetic acid(TFA) containing $0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l }$ ofmyo-inositol (internal standard)for $9 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ .The TFA was evaporated in a stream of ${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ = Sugarswere dissolved in $1 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of $1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ N H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { O H }$ and $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m g / m L } ~ \mathsf { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ in DMSO (w/v) and incubated at $4 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for $9 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ with occasional vortex mixing.The solution was neutralized with $1 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of glacial acetic acid,and then, $1 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of $\harpoonleft$ 1 methylimidazole (Sigma) followed by $0 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of acetic anhydride was added,and the mixture was incubated at $4 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ Water $( 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L } )$ wasadded to destroy unreacted acetic anhydride, and when cool,the alditol acetates were partitioned into $C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 }$ The entire reaction was completed in 1-dram vials sealed with Teflon-lined caps.Derivatives were separated by gas-liquid chromatography(GLC）on a $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } \times 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m }$ column of SP2330 (Supelco,Bellefonte，PA).Temperature was held at $8 0 ^ { \circ } C$ during injection,then ramped to $1 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ at $2 5 \ { \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C / \min } }$ and then to $2 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ at $5 ^ { \circ } C / \min$ ，witha $1 0 - m i n$ hold at the upper temperature.Helium flow was 1 mL/min with split-less injection The electron impact mass spectrometry (EIMS)was performed with a Hewlett-Packard MSD at $7 0 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ and a source temperature of $2 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$
