Nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) with an aligned mesoporous structure were synthesized by a co-confined carbonization method using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS)as co-confined templates and ionic liquids as the precursor.The as-synthesized MCNFs with the diameter of $8 0 - 1 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ possessed a bulk nitrogen content of $5 . 3 \mathrm { w t \% }$ and bimodal mesoporous structure.The nitrogen atoms were mostly bound to the graphitic network in two forms,i.e. pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen,providing adsorption sites for acidic gases like $S 0 _ { 2 }$ and ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ .Cyclic experiments revealeda considerable stability of MCNFs over 2O runs of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ adsorption and 15 runs for $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ adsorption.The MCNFs also have a preferable adsorption performance for $\mathsf { C d } ^ { 2 + }$

# 1.Introduction

Both one-dimensional (1D)and mesoporous carbon materials are of tremendous interests because of their special structures and promising applications in the fields of electronics,composites,environmental protection,catalysis,etc.[1-4].Mesoporous carbon nanofibers may combine the advantages of mesoporous structure and the 1D morphology.For example,when MCNFs is used as an adsorbent,1D mesoporous architecture can provide sufficient porosity as well shortened pathway for the target molecules with the fast adsorption kinetics.Further introducing nitrogencontaining functional groups into the graphitic matrix would benefit MCNFs an improved capacity to capture some acidic gases such as $S 0 _ { 2 }$ ， $S 0 _ { 3 }$ and ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ [5-10]. $S 0 _ { 2 }$ in the atmosphere isapt to threat humans'health and cause acid rain,which has been a serious problem for the ecosystem.Compared with other technologies,the adsorption process by using the solid carbon adsorbent requires simple equipment and does not generate any derived pollutants [11,12]. $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ ,which is the main greenhouse gas to result in global warming,is produced as a flue gas in many industrial processes,and in automobile exhausts [13]. The removal of ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ from flue gases bya capture process is necessary prior to their release to the atmosphere.Recently,nitrogen-functionalized mesoporous silica and carbon materials have been extensively used as a sorbent for ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ capture due to the strong chemical interaction between ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ moleculesand sorbents and they show relatively good performance resulting from the combination of their high surface area and the basicity of nitrogen-containing groups [14,15].

Electrospinning technique is usually applied to produce porous MCNFs by the addition of porogens or subsequent activation processes [16,17],but its industrialization is still limited by the difficulties in controlling synthesis parameters and enhancing the productivity.There are many studies on the templating approach to MCNFs [5,6,18-2O]. For instance,MCNFs were prepared by carbonizing the proper precursors within suitable templates having long tunnels,such as anodic aluminum oxide(AAO)membrane and crab shell.This method allows adjusting the structural properties of MCNFs such as pore size and surface functionality.Nevertheless, the evaporation induced self-assembly process comprises multiple steps and is thus time-consuming. Few reports showed that the MCNFs can be directly synthesized via carbonizing1D polymer while the obtained MCNFs displayed a low surface area and infinite pore volume [21,22].

Ionic liquids(ILs）have negligible vapor pressure,wide liquidrange,high thermal stabilityand capacity to be incorporated into porous templates avoiding high pressure and evaporation. Most recently,the advantages of ILs as a new carbon source have attracted many interests for the synthesis of carbon materials. Imidazolium-and pyridinium-based ILs containing dicyanamide anions have been employed to produce nitrogen-doped carbons materials with favorable structures [23-25].In these studies,all the ILs contain cross-linkable functional groups(so called taskspecific ionic liquids,TSILs）such as nitrile,as the intermediate polymeric structures during thermal decomposition,whereas the synthesis ofTSILs is complex and costly.Herein we present a simple co-confined carbonization method,usinga cheap ILs(1-dodecyl3-methylimidazolium bromide, ${ \mathsf { C } } _ { 1 2 } { \mathrm { M I M B r } } )$ as the precursor,to prepare nitrogen-doped MCNFs.Both the AAO membrane and tetraethylorthosilicate(TEOS) were used as the co-confined templates.The arrayed MCNFs possessed uniformed morphologyand typical mesoporous characteristic,contained $5 . 3 \mathrm { w t \% }$ of nitrogen in bulk,and displayed a preferable performance for the adsorption of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ = ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ and ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { d } } ^ { 2 + }$

# 2.Experimental

# 2.1.Synthesis of AAO template

The AAO membrane was synthesized by the method reported in previous work with some modification [26].Fora typical synthesis, the AAO membrane with an average pore diameter of $8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ were prepared by anodizingaluminum foil (purity $9 9 . 9 9 9 \%$ at $4 0 \mathrm { v }$ in $0 . 3 { \mathrm { } } \mathrm { M }$ oxalic acid solution for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ ,followed by removing the membrane with a mixed acid of $6 \%$ phosphoric acid and $4 \%$ chromic acid $\begin{array} { r } { \big ( \boldsymbol { \nabla } \colon \boldsymbol { \mathsf { V } } = 1 { : } 1 \big ) . } \end{array}$ ),then for the second anodizing with the same condition for $1 0 \mathrm { h }$ .The specimen was then dipped into saturated cupric chloride to etching the unreacted aluminum,followed by adjusting the pore diameter in a $5 \mathrm { w t \% }$ phosphoric acid solution at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $4 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .The AAO templateswithdifferent pore diameterswere obtained through changing the anodizing voltage.

# 2.2.Synthesis of MCNFs

$1 . 0 { \mathrm { g } } { }$ of ${ \mathsf { C } } _ { 1 2 } { \mathrm { M I M B r } }$ (Shanghai Cheng Jie Chemical Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in $3 \mathrm { m L }$ ofethanolandstirred for $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ .AAOmembranes were added into the solution in vacuum for $4 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and dried at $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ In order to make the AAO membranes fully infiltrated with ionic liquid,the above step repeated for several times.The carbonization was conducted in ${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ at $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $2 \mathrm { h }$ with a heating rate of $1 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { m i n } } ^ { - 1 }$ ,after which the AAO templates were removed byusing $10 \%$ aqueous HF.The products were referredas MCNF- $x$ where $x$ indicates the diameters of the MCNFs.For the co-confined synthesis,typically, $1 . 0 { \mathrm { g } } { }$ of ${ \mathsf { C } } _ { 1 2 } { \mathrm { M I M B r } }$ was dissolved in $3 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ of ethanol followedbyadding $0 . 5 { \mathrm { g } }$ TEOS and $1 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ formic acid,and then stirred for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .The following procedure was identical to that of MCNF-x.The obtained samples were denoted as MCNF- $x - y$ where $y$ indicates the mass ratio of TEOS: ILs.

Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were evaluated on a Micrometitics TriStar 3o2O volumetric adsorption analyzer at $- 1 9 6 ^ { \circ } C .$ 、The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET） method was utilized to calculate the specific surface area of each sample while the average pore size distribution was derived from the desorption branch using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.The total pore volume was estimated from the $\mathsf { N } _ { 2 }$ amount adsorbed atarelative pressure of $P / P _ { 0 } = 0 . 9 7$ .Raman measurements were performed under ambient conditions using a $5 3 2 \mathrm { n m }$ $( 2 . 3 3 \mathrm { e V } )$ laser in the back-scattering configuration ona Jobin-Yvon HR800 Spectrometer.X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy(XPS）spectra were obtained using an Axis Ultra spectrometer (Kratos,UK).A mono $\mathsf { A l - K } \alpha$ 0 $1 4 8 6 . 6 \mathrm { e V } ,$ X-ray source was used at a power of 225W( $1 5 \mathrm { k V } ,$ ，15 mA).To correct the surface charge effect,binding energies were calibrated using the C1s hydrocarbon peak at $2 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { e V }$ 、Element analysis was achieved using an Elementar Vario Micro Cube.Thermogravimetric(TG)analysis was achieved using $\mathrm { ~ Q ~ } 6 0 0$ of TA Instruments-Waters $5 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ under air atmosphere.

# 2.4.Adsorption

The experimental apparatus is schematically shown in Fig.1. $0 . 1 \mathrm { g }$ MCNFs was put in the sorption bed and the gas flow rate was controlled by mass flow controllers.The adsorbing experimentwas carried out using a mixed gas composed of $\mathsf { N } _ { 2 } , \mathsf { O } _ { 2 } \left( 5 \% , \mathsf { v } / \mathsf { v } \right)$ and $S 0 _ { 2 }$ (2400 ppmv) at $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The mixed gas flows through the sorption bed oflength $3 5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ with inner diameter $6 \mathrm { m m }$ atarate of $8 \mathrm { d m } ^ { 3 } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ . The $S 0 _ { 2 }$ content in the effluent was analyzed by a hand-held combustion analyzer (Model KM94o,Kane International Limited).The sorption bed was considered saturated with $S 0 _ { 2 }$ when the concentration of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ in effluent was the same as that in the input stream.The breakthrough capacity of the sorbent ( $\cdot Q$ $\mathrm { m g g ^ { - 1 } }$ )was calculated using the followed formula:

$$
Q = \int ( C _ { 0 } - C ) \cdot \nu \cdot M / ( m \cdot V _ { m } ) d t
$$

M is the molar weight of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ $\mathbf { g } \mathbf { m } \mathbf { o } \mathbf { l } ^ { - 1 }$ ， $C _ { 0 }$ is the concentration of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ in input stream and $c$ is the detected concentration of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ in the effluent gas,ppmv; $\nu$ is the flow rate of the mixed gas, $\mathrm { d } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ $V _ { m }$ is the molar volume of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ $\mathrm { d } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ $m$ is the mass of adsorbent filled in the sorption bed, $\mathbf { g }$ ；tis theadsorb balance time of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ 1 min. ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ adsorption isotherms were evaluated onaMicrometitics TriStar 3o2O volumetric adsorption analyzer and the samples was regenerated at $1 8 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ for $4 \mathrm { h }$ in air.

The adsorption experiment of ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { d } } ^ { 2 + }$ was carried out as follows: $5 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of the samples were added into $1 5 \mathrm { m L }$ solution of $\mathsf { C d } ( \mathsf { N O } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 }$ (0.5M),at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with continued stirring for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ .After filtration and separation,the samples were washed with distilled water till no ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { d } } ^ { 2 + }$ can be detection. Then the samples were dried at $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ followed by TG tested to (in air) to measure the absorbed ions content in the samples.

# 3.Results and discussion

The whole process of the synthesis can be schematically described in Scheme 1.A homogeneous solution containing ${ \mathsf { C } } _ { 1 2 } { \mathrm { M I M B r } }$ and ethanol as solvent,with or without the presence of TEOS,is infiltrated into the nano-channels of AAO membrane in vacuum.For the case without TEOS,the acidic surface of AAO adsorbs $\mathsf { B r ^ { - } }$ firstly and subsequently $\mathrm { [ C _ { 1 2 } M I M ] ^ { + } }$ ions [27]. The ILs fragmentsare adsorbed on the interior surface of AAO by the electrostatic force.With the evaporation of ethanol solvent,more and more ILs staying at the outer surface of channels are adsorbed inside the channels of AAO under the capillary force.The material is then carbonized in a flow of ultrapure $\mathsf { N } _ { 2 }$ while the ILs starts to decompose and transform into particular carbon inside the channels of AAO.To confine the shrinkage during carbonization, TEOS is added as a second confined template.TEOS and ILs can be mixed to form a uniform solution.After the carbonizing of ILs and the removing of templates,the ordered MCNFs containing many uniformmesopores are obtained.In fact,experiment results manifest that ordered MCNFs with uniform mesopore cannot be obtained through direct carbonizing the conventional ILs without the adding of AAO or TEOS.Therefore,we propose a“co-confined carbonizationmethod"for the MCNFs synthesis,in which the co-confined effectis broughtby theaddition of both AAO and TEOS.Thisconcept can be universal by using other types of ILs as precursor to produce MCNFs (Fig.S1).

# 3.1.Characterizationof thematerials

Fig.2 shows the SEM images of MCNF-80，MCNF-100, MCNF-120,MCNF-80-0.25,MCNF-80-0.5 and MCNF-80-1.0.With theabsence ofTEOS,the produced material displayed the fibrous morphology benefiting from the spatial confinement effect of the AAO template (Fig.2a).However,the surface of fibers was quite rough and some fractured pieces can be observed,due to the weak interaction between the ILs and the inner wall of channels that induced the severe decomposition and shrinkage of ILs during carbonization. The time of impregnation process can slightly affect the morphology of produced fibers.When impregnation step was repeated,the fibers became longer and displayed quite uniformly. The average diameter of MCNFs was found to increase with the channel size of AAO and it ranged from 80 to $1 2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ,as shown in Fig.2a-c.TEM image of MCNF-8O sample in Fig.2a revealed that the fibers were constructed by small carbon particles,in accordance with the SEM results.

When TEOS was introduced as the co-confined template with anappropriate amount, the as-synthesized MCNFs became more uniformwith analmost smooth surface being free of individual particles (Fig.2d).It can be regarded that at the elevated temperature, ILswere carbonized in the confined space formed by TEOS-derived silica nanoparticles and AAO.After the AAO and silica templates were removed by etching,MCNFs with interconnected pores can be produced.Meanwhile,the TEOS witha strong interaction with ILs and AAO channel can prevent the MCNFs contract during carbonization(Scheme 1).As a consequence,the quality of MCNFs was significantly improved even under the same carbonization condition.We note that both confined space and strong interaction with the templates were necessary for the synthesis of MCNFs by using the conventional ILs.However,as we continuously increased the mass ratio of TEOS to ILs to 1.O,the fibrous structure was destroyed and many cracked pieces appeared due to the steric hindrance effect of the excessive silica particles (Fig.2f).

The effect of TEOS/ILs ratio on the structure of MCNFs was detailed by TEM and XRD characterizations.Typical images of MCNF-80,MCNF-80-0.25 and MCNF-80-0.5 were illustrated in Fig.3a-c. Different from MCNF-8O with the irregular walls, MCNF-80-0.25 and MCNF-80-0.5 displayed the relatively complete feature of nanofibers,in agreement with the SEM results in Fig.2. Both high-resolution TEM image and XRD pattern in Fig.3d-e reported a partially graphitic structure of MCNF-8O-O.5.The lattice spacing distance was estimated to be around $0 . 3 6 \mathrm { n m }$ being larger than that of pure graphite crystal,which is usually explained by the doping of nitrogen atoms in the graphitic matrix [28].Three reflections at $2 \theta = 2 5 . 8$ ,43,53and $7 9 ^ { \circ }$ can be identified in the XRD pattern in Fig.3e and corresponded to the (00 2),(10O),(004) and (110） planes of graphite,respectively. The $d _ { 0 0 2 }$ value was calculated to be $0 . 3 6 \mathrm { n m }$ ,being close to the TEM result,according to the Braggformula.

${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of MCNFs are depicted in Fig.4.It can be observed that all isotherm curvesof the MCNFs samples exhibiteda hysteresis loop inawide $P / P _ { 0 }$ range of O.4-1.0,demonstrating the mesoporous characteristic of the materials.This can be considered as accumulated pores of carbon particles and the space among the MCNFs after etching of the AAO and TEOS templates.The curves in Fig.4a can be classified as type IV isotherm with a pronounced H3-type hysteresis loop,corresponding to a slit-shaped mesopore.Two kinds of mesopores centered at 3.8 and $5 . 6 \mathrm { - } 7 . 6 \mathrm { n m }$ were observed in Fig.4b.As compared with MCNF-80,MCNF-80-0.25 and MCNF-80-0.5 possessed more mesopores centering at about $3 . 8 \mathrm { n m }$ .Considering the peak position is identical,we attributed it to the spontaneously formed porosity inside the derived carbon particles via the decomposition of ILs aggregates being independent with the participation of TEOS.With the increasing amount of TEOS,the summit of bigger mesopore at about $7 . 6 \mathrm { n m }$ shifted downwards to 7.0 and further $5 . 6 \mathrm { n m }$ .We therefore attributed the mesopores at around $5 . 6 \mathrm { n m }$ to the accumulating of the carbon particles and the removal of silica nanoparticles.MCNF-8O shrunk irregularly due to the weak interface force between ILs and AAO walls during carbonization.With the TEOS as the co-confined template,the structure of the nanofibers was strengthened and the shrinkage was greatly restricted to result in a complete morphology of fibrous carbon.The TEOS-derived silica nanoparticles also benefited a significant increase of the pore volume (Table 1).

The elemental analysis showed that the overall nitrogen content of MCNF-80-0.5 was $5 . 3 \mathrm { w t \% }$ in bulk.In order to clarify the chemical states of nitrogen dopant,we examined the C1s and N1s XPS spectra of the MCNF-80-0.5 sample(Fig.5).Three elementary components were identified in the C1s spectrum(Fig.5a).The main peak at $2 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { e V }$ corresponded to the graphite-like $s p ^ { 2 } { \mathsf C }$ ,indicating that most of the C atoms were arranged in a conjugated honeycomb lattice.Two small peaksat 286.0 and $2 8 9 . 2 \mathrm { e V }$ reflecteddifferent bonding structure of the $\mathsf { C - N }$ bonds and were assigned to the N$\displaystyle s p ^ { 2 } C$ and $\scriptstyle \mathbf { N } - s p ^ { 3 }$ C bonds,respectively,which may originate from the substitution of N atoms to the defects or the edge of the graphitic layer[29].Deconvolution of the N1s spectrum(Fig.5b) reported two components,i.e.pyrrolic and/or pyridonic nitrogen (4oo.6 eV), and pyridinic nitrogen (398.7eV)[30].

The Raman spectrum of MCNF-8O-O.5 is displayed in Fig.6. Two obvious peaks at ${ \sim } 1 3 4 0$ and $\sim 1 5 8 6 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ can be related with the $D$ and $G$ bands,respectively.The $D$ band,commonly centering between 1200 and $1 4 5 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and indicatinga reduction in the symmetry of the graphitic lattice,was caused byatomic substitution or structural defects [31].The G band was attributed to the $\mathtt { E 2 g }$ vibration mode that is present due to the $s p ^ { 2 }$ bonded graphitic carbons [3O].The intercalation of nitrogen atoms resulted ina slightly downward shift of $G$ band [30].

# 3.2.Adsorption tests

As seen in Fig.7a,in a diluted flow of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ (2400 ppmv), the breakthrough time increased remarkably from MCNF-8O to MCNF80-0.5.Longer breakthrough time revealed an enhanced adsorption capacity and faster response to the acidic pollutant.MCNF-80- 0.5 possessed a satisfactory adsorption capacity of $4 0 . 2 \mathrm { m g g ^ { - 1 } }$ being 2.9 times that of MCNF-80.It is worth noting that the $S 0 _ { 2 }$ adsorption capacity even approach that of the reported activated carbon fibers (ACFs)[32],while the surface area of the MCNFs is much lower than that of ACFs(ca. $1 5 0 0 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } .$ ).TheXPS result in Fig.5 showed that the main chemical states of nitrogen in MCNFs were pyrrolic and/or pyridonic nitrogen.The $S 0 _ { 2 }$ molecules might be physically adsorbed on MCNFs through hydrogen bond with pyrrolic-N or neighboring hydroxy pyridonic-N,and the nitrogencontain species (Fig.7c).It is also plausible that surface oxygen functional groups like hydroxyls tend to chemically bind $S 0 _ { 2 }$ to produce sulfite ions and the derived sulfate ions after the contact with $0 _ { 2 }$ [33],which unfortunately contributes to the irreversible capacity ofMCNFs.The cyclicadsorption testsof $S 0 _ { 2 }$ showed that the adsorption capacity of MCNFs gradually decreased for about $7 \%$ during the first six cycles but remained almost unchanged in the following 14 cycles (Fig. 7d).

To comprehend the details the adsorption process,we employed the XPS technique to check the difference of surface chemical state of fresh and used MCNF-80-0.5 samples.Fig.8 presents the $S 2 p$ andN1sspectra of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ -saturated MCNF-8O-O.5after desorptionat $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ .The sample showed two individual peaks at 168.4 and $1 6 3 . 9 \mathrm { e V }$ ,respectively,which represent $S 0 _ { 3 } { } ^ { 2 - } / S 0 _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ and $S ^ { 2 - }$ according to the peak standard card.The $S 0 _ { 3 } { } ^ { 2 - } / S 0 _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ derived from the catalysis reaction of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ on the surface of N-doped MCNFs [32,34]. The $S ^ { 2 - }$ perhaps derived from the production of disproportionation reaction of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ . The N1s peak positions(centered at 400.6 and $3 9 8 . 7 \mathrm { e V } )$ have no obvious change compared to that of before adsorption of $S 0 _ { 2 }$ (Fig.5). So it can be speculated that the favorable $S 0 _ { 2 }$ cyclic adsorption capacity can be remained mainly due to the weak physical adsorption on the alkaline caused by the N species.

Porous carbons and their counterparts doped with nitrogen areattracting wide interest for ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ adsorption due to their high surface areas and the enhanced interactions by the presence of nitrogen-containing functionalities [35,36].Herein, ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ adsorption isotherms of the MCNFs samples were shown in Fig.9.At $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and ${ 9 0 0 } \mathrm { m m H g }$ ，theadsorption capacity of all the samples were much higher than the reported KOH-activated graphite nanofibers $( 1 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ）[37].The adsorption capacity of MCNF-80-0.5 $\left( 2 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l } \mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 } \right.$ ）ishigher than that the other MCNFs samples or hard-templated mesoporous carbon ( $\cdot 1 . 5 1 \mathrm { m m o l } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ) (Fig.9a) [38]. While the temperature of flue gas containing ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ after desulfurization is about $6 0 { - } 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ,therefore the capture of ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ at the relatively high temperature has more significant. So the high temperature adsorption was tested (Fig. 9b).The adsorption capacities of the samples deteriorate with increasing temperature.The adsorption capacity of MCNF-8O-O.5 only decreased $0 . 8 \mathrm { m m o l } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at $8 0 ^ { \circ } C$ However,the adsorption capacity of other carbon materials, such as mesoporous CN spheres,reduced move obviously(from 2.90 to $0 . 9 7 \mathrm { m m o l } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,at $7 5 ^ { \circ } C _ { \cdot } ^ { \cdot }$ [39].For ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ adsorption,physical adsorption is the main adsorption form to pure carbon,while the chemical adsorption is the main adsorption form to the MCNFs, which is attributed to the presence of nitrogen-containing functionalities that can promote $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ capture.With the adsorption temperature increasing,the physical adsorption decreased more obviously than the chemical adsorption.Therefore the MCNFs manifested better adsorption capacityat high temperature.The cyclic adsorption tests of ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ at $8 0 ^ { \circ } C$ showed that the adsorption capacity of MCNF-8O-O.5 at equilibrium has no obvious decreasing even after15 cycles (Fig. 9c).

What is more,one promising application of the nitrogen-doped carbon is to adsorb heavy metal ions like ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { d } } ^ { 2 + }$ from the polluted water.The adsorption capacities of $\mathsf { C d } ^ { 2 + }$ of MCNFs were also measured based on TG curves.As shown in Fig.1O,all the MCNFs samples have much higher adsorption capacities for ${ \mathsf { C d } } ^ { 2 + }$ than mesoporous carbon FDU-15 with a BET surface area of $8 7 9 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ and pore volume of $1 . 0 8 \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ . The capacities were 27.4, 25.0 and $2 4 . 5 \mathrm { m m o l } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ for MCNF-80-0.5,MCNF-80-0.25 and MCNF-80,respectively. However,the capacity of FDU-15 was only $0 . 3 9 \mathrm { m m o l } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ .The improved capacity also can be attributed to the nitrogen-containing functionalities and the special pore structures of the MCNFs.

# 4.Conclusions

Nitrogen-doped MCNFs have been prepared by using template method,with conventional ILs as precursors and AAO as template. The pore structure and surface area of MCNFs have a remarkable improvementby introducing TEOS as the co-confined template.The diameter size of MCNFs can be modulated by changing the pore diameter of the templates.Apossible formation mechanism is proposed to interpret the synthetic process of MCNFs.The obtained MCNFs manifest better adsorption capacity for $S 0 _ { 2 }$ ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ and ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { d } } ^ { 2 + }$
