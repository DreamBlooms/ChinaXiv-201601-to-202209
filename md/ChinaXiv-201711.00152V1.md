# 1 INTRODUCTION

Coordination polymers with bridged transition metals have received intense interest and attention for their fascinating architectures and potential applications as materials in optical, electronic, magnetic fields，gas storage,catalysis and so on[1-5]. Consequently, numerous new complexes can be specially designed by the careful selection of metal centers with preferred coordination geometriesl6-9l. It has been observed that organic ligands play crucial roles in the preparation of some interesting coordination networks,such as flexibility, donating type，and the geometry of organic ligands[10-1l. Among various organic ligands，aromatic carboxylates have been extensively used because of their extension ability in both covalent bonding and supramolecular interactions (H-bonding and aromatic stacking).For example，1,3-benzenedicarboxylate, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate，1,2-benzenedicarboxylate，1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate，and1,2,3,5-benzene tetracarboxylate are wel used in the construction of MOFs due to their structural rigidity,chemical stability and appropriate connectivity. Meanwhile,the polycyclic aromatic bidentate ligands like 2,2-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline are frequently used corporately with polycarboxylates，leading to many novel architectures.

Asacontinuationofourpreviouswork，herewesynthesizeanew ligand 2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-1H-1,3,7,8-tetraaza-cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene (ctpt), based on which together with aic,a novel 1D complex $[ \mathbf { M } \mathbf { n } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { c t p t } ) _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { a i c } ) _ { 2 } ] _ { \mathrm { n } }$ (1) has been synthesized. Further, the thermal stability and luminescent property of 1 have also been investigated.

# 2 EXPERIMENTAL

# 2. 1 Generals

With the exception of ligand ctpt,all the other chemicals were commercially available and used as purchased.IR spectrum was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer.Elemental analyses of C,H and N were performed on a PE-240O elemental analyzer.Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed using a Perkin-Elmer TG-7 analyzer in nitrogen atmosphere. Crystal structure determination was carried out on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD X-ray difractometer. The emission spectra were recorded on a FLSP 920 Edinburgh fluorescence spectrometer.

# 2.2Synthesis of complex 1

Complex 1 was prepared as follows: ctpt (0.099 g, 0.3 mmol), $\bf { M n S O _ { 4 } }$ $_ \mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ (0.051 g, 0.3 mmol), and aic $( 1 . 0 0 0 \mathrm { g } , 0 . 6 \mathrm { m m o l } )$ were dissolved in distilled water ( $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ),and NaOH was added until the $\mathrm { p H }$ value of the system was adjusted to about 8.O. The resulting solution was stirred for about $0 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ at room temperature, sealed in a $3 0 \mathrm { - m L }$ Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at $1 7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for three days,and finally cooled to room temperature at a rate of $5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } I$ h. The yellow crystals of 1 were collected in $78 \%$ yield based on Mn. $\mathrm { C _ { 2 7 } H _ { 1 6 } C l M n N _ { 5 } O _ { 4 } }$ :calcd. C, 57.36; H, 2.83; N, $12 . 3 9 \%$ .

# 2.3X-ray structure determination

A selected yellow crystal with approximate dimensions of $0 . 4 5 \mathrm { m m } \times 0 . 3 8 \mathrm { m m } \times 0 . 3 3 \mathrm { m m }$ was mounted on a glass fiber. The difraction data were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation $( \lambda = 0 . 7 1 0 7 3 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ } )$ at 293(2) K in the range of $1 . 7 0 { \leqslant } \theta { \leqslant } 2 5 . 0 3 ^ { \circ }$ A total of 13736 reflections were collected and 4244 were independent with $R _ { \mathrm { i n t } } = 0 . 0 6 5 7$ .The data were corrected for $L \boldsymbol { p }$ factors. The crystal structure was solved by direct methods with SHELXS-97[12] and refined with SHELXL-97[13] by full-matrix least-squares techniques on $F ^ { 2 }$ .All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and all hydrogen atoms isotropically. Allthe hydrogen atoms attached to carbon were generated geometrically.

# 3 RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

# 3.1Description of the structure

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the title complex crystallizes in the $C 2 / c$ space group. Selected bond distances and bond angles are presented in Table 1.

X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis reveals that complex 1 is a 1D double-chain structure.As shown in Fig.1, the coordination of Mn atom can be described as a distorted tetragonal pyramid geometry.Each $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { n } ^ { \mathrm { { I I } } }$ atom in 1 is coordinated by three carboxylate oxygen atoms from three distinct aic ligands,and two nitrogen atom donors from one chelating ctpt ligand.The bond distances of Mn-Oin 1 are from 2.041(3)to 2.102(3) A, and those of Mn-N fall in the $2 . 2 4 7 ( 4 ) \widetilde { \mathrm { \scriptsize ~ 4 . 2 7 8 ( 4 ) ~ } } \mathring { \mathrm { \scriptsize ~ A } }$ range. The O(N)-Mn-N(O) angles are from 88.42(1) to $1 5 6 . 8 0 ( 1 ) ^ { \circ }$ . The Mn-O/N bond lengths are all consistent with the corresponding values found in literatures[14-18].

It is interesting that the aic ligand coordinates to three Mn ions through three carboxylic oxygen atoms in a mono-bridging fashion, which gives rise to a1D double-chain structure (Fig.2).It should be mentioned that in the unit of 1 two types of rings are formed: the 8-membered ring (the angle of O(3)-Mn(1)-O(4) is $9 7 . 7 2 7 ^ { \circ }$ and the distance of $\mathbf { M n ^ { \cdots } M n }$ is 3.849 $\mathring \mathrm { A }$ )and the 16-membered ring (the angle of O(1)-Mn (1)-O(3) is $9 1 . 7 5 6 ^ { \circ }$ and the distance of Mn.Mn is $7 . 9 5 3 \mathring \mathrm { A } \bar { . }$ ）

There are strong $\mathrm { N - H \mathrm { \mathrm { . . . O } } }$ hydrogen bonding interactions observed in complex 1, which play an important role in stabilizing the network structure and form a higher dimensional structure.As illustrated in Fig. 3,the existence of ${ \mathrm { N } } { \mathrm { - } } { \mathrm { H } } ^ { \cdot \cdot \cdot } { \mathrm { O } } ( { \mathrm { H } } ( 3 { \mathrm { A } } ) { \cdots } { \mathrm { O } } ( 4 ) = 1 . 8 6 { \overset { \circ } { \mathrm { A } } } , { \mathrm { N } } ( 3 ) { \cdots } { \mathrm { O } } ( 4 ) = 2 . 7 0 2 { \overset { \circ } { \mathrm { A } } }$ and $\mathrm { N } ( 3 ) – \mathrm { H } ( 3 \mathrm { A } ) { \cdots } \mathrm { O } ( 4 ) = 1 6 5 ^ { \circ } ,$ hydrogen bonds leads to the construction of a 3D supramolecular network.

# 3.2Thermal analysis

To characterize the thermal stability of complex 1,TG curves have been obtained from crystalline samples in the flowing nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of $1 0 \ \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C / m i n }$ (Fig. 4). As expected, complex 1 exhibits two steps of weight loss. The first one corresponding to the removal of aic ligand is $3 0 . 1 0 \%$ (calcd. $3 1 . 7 5 \%$ ） from 458 to $4 7 9 \ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , and the second one due to the departure of ctpt ligand is $5 8 . 9 0 \%$ (calcd. $5 8 . 5 0 \%$ ）inthe temperature range of $4 7 9 { \sim } 8 0 4 \ \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The final formation of the metal oxide is maybe MnO.The thermal analysis result suggests the one-dimensional chain structure of anhydrous complex 1 is stable below $4 5 8 \ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ ：

# 3.3 Photoluminescent properties

Luminescence property is very important in photochemistry and photophysics.So in this study，we research the luminescence of1,as well as the free ligands (Fig. 5). Complex 1 shows one strong emisson band at $5 1 4 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ (excitation at $3 2 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ).To further analyze the nature of these emission bands,the emission properties of aic and ctpt ligands are also investigated under the same experimental conditions.The free ligand ctpt exhibits one emission band at $4 9 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ，and aic exhibits one emission band at $4 3 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ (excitation at 320 nm). Complex 1 is red-shifted by $1 9 \mathrm { n m }$ relative to the ctpt ligand,and red-shifted by $7 6 \mathrm { n m }$ relative to that of aic.The emission bands for the free ligands are probably atributable to the $\pi ^ { * }$ -n transitions. Complex 1 may be a good candidate for potential photoluminescence materials,because it is highly thermally stable and insoluble in water and common organic solvents.

# 3.4Theoretical calculations

To elucidate the essential electronic characters of this complex,the theoretical calculation was performed by density functional theory (DFT)[19] functional with Gaussian O9 program[20],LANLDZbasis set for Mn atom and $6 { \cdot } 3 1 \mathrm { g } ( \mathrm { d } )$ basis set for all other atoms. The geometric parameters from X-ray diffraction analysis were used as the starting point. There was no symmetry constraint on this complex.The density diagrams of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of Mn complex in ground state are calculated and shown in Fig. 6.

For complex 1, HOMO and LUMO both reside on the aniline ligands.HOMO distributes as low as $0 . 5 \%$ over the $d$ orbital of each Mn atom,whereas the $d$ orbitals of Mn atoms make hardly any contribution for LUMO.The atached phenanthroline derivative ligands of electron rich properties are helpful to electron-transporting. Therefore, HOMO is distributed mainly over one phenanthroline derivative ligand, while LUMO is localized mainly on another phenanthroline derivative ligand. Each phenanthroline derivative ligand contributes to HOMO or LUMO as high as $98 \%$ ：

# 4 CONCLUSION

In conclusion,a new complex has been hydrothermally synthesized,and structurally characterized by elemental analysis,IR spectrum,TG,and single-crystal X-raydiffraction. Complex 1 has high thermal stability and is worthy of further study as candidate of potential photoluminescence material.
