# INTRODUCTION

Ganoderma lucidum iscommonlyusedfor prevention andtreatment of a variety ofdiseases including immunological disorders [1], ，infections [2, 3], chronic hepatitis,gastric ulcer[4]， hypoglycemic[5, 6],and scleroderma tumorigenic diseases s [7-nl Ganoderic acids (GAs)，identified astriterpenoids, arethemajor bioactive compounds found in $G _ { * }$ 、lucidum.Among these GAs,GA-A was demonstrated to control lymphoma growth both in vitro and in vivo [i2]and enhance the chemosensitivityofHepG2 cellstocisplatinby inhibiting the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway[13]. GA-A and GA-H were found to suppress the growth and invasiveness of breast cancer cells by inhibiting the transcription factorsAP-1 and nuclear factor-kB (NF- $\boldsymbol { \kappa }$ B)[14].

Osteosarcoma is the most commonly diagnosed primary malignant tumor of the bone in human. Approximately $60 \%$ of osteosarcoma occur in patients under 20 yearsof age[i5-17],and its treatment remains a challenge.It has been demonstrated that SCGLP1，a sulfated polysaccharide from the fruiting bodies of $G$ lucidum,can produce significant inhibitory effect on MG63 cell proliferation and viability and cause cell apoptosis with only minor cytotoxic effect on normal human osteoblasts [18]. So far few studies have been reportedtoexaminethebioactivityofpurified triterpenes against osteosarcoma cells.In this study,we aimed to examine the effect of GA-A on osteosarcoma cell proliferation,apoptosis and invasion and explore the possiblemechanismsunderlyingtheseeffectsby examining 3 important signaling pathways.

# MATERIALSANDMETHODS

# Cell culture

Human osteosarcoma HOS and MG-63 cells were supplied by the Institute of Cell Bank/Institutes for Biological Sciences (Shanghai, China).HOS cells were cultured inminimum essential medium(MEM) supplemented with $10 \%$ fetal bovineserum (FBS). MG63 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with $10 \%$ FBS. Thesecellswereculturedinahumidified incubatorwith $9 5 \%$ airand $5 \%$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ at $3 7 \ \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } }$

# Cell treatment

Purified GA-A (purity ${ > } 9 6 \%$ by HPLC),obtained from Chromadex,was dissolved in methanol at the concentration of $5 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ and stored at $4 \mathrm { { ~ } ^ { \circ } C }$ . The cells were exposed to 0.10, 0.25,and 0.50 mmol/L GA-A[14] and the changes in their biological behaviorswere evaluated, using cells treated with O.2 ml $1 \%$ methanol as control.

# Cell proliferation assay

Thecells ( $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { m l }$ ）incubatedina 96-well plat were treated with $0 . 2 \mathrm { \ m l }$ ethanol solution of GA-A of indicated concentrations for 24,48 or $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $3 7 \ \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } }$ .The change of cell proliferation was evaluated using MTT assaykit(Promega) followingthemanufacturer's protocol. Briefly, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ of MTT reagent was added to each well and the plate was incubated for $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $3 7 \ \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } }$ After the medium was removed, $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well to dissolve formazan formed.After 3O min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at $5 7 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ using a Vmax microplatespectrophotometer(MolecularDevices, Sunnyvale,CA,USA). The $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad $\mathrm { P r i s m } \ 5 . \mathrm { 0 }$ (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA),using the dose-response with variable slope function.Each sample was assayed in triplicate.

# Cell apoptosis assay

HOS and MG-63 cells were harvested $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ after GA-A treatment and washed twice with PBS after centrifugation at $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r / m i n }$ for $5 \mathrm { m i n }$ .Thecells $( 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } )$ were resuspended with $5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ binding buffer from a KGA107 kit (KeyGene,Nanjing, China) followed by the addition of $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { l } }$ of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC）and then $5 \ \mu \mathrm { l }$ ofpropidium iodide.After incubation for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at room temperature in darkness, the cells were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry.

# Cell invasion assay

HOS and MG-63 cells treated with GA-A for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ were transferredto thetopcompartmentof Matrigel-coated chambers (24-well insert, $8 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ pore size,BD Biosciences,San Jose,USA）which contained serum-free DMEM or MEM.The medium containing $20 \%$ FBS was added to the lower chamber asa chemoattractant.After incubation for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,thecells that did not invade were removed from the upper chamber with cotton swabs while the invasive cells were fixed with $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde,stained with hematoxylin, and photographed $( \times 2 0 0 )$ in five random fields for each well. The number of invasive cells was counted using Image-Pro Plus software and averaged from the 5 fields. Each assay was repeated for 3 times.

# Western blotting

To investigate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of GA-A on HOS and MG-63 cells,we detected the protein expression levels of STAT3,p-STAT3,p38，p-p38 and NF-kB1 with Western blotting.The primary antibodies and secondary antibodies were purchased from CST (Boston, USA),

HOS and MG-63 cells $( 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } )$ were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS.The cell pellets were suspended in RIPA lysis buffer for $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ on ice,and the lysates were centrifuged at $1 2 \ 0 0 0 \ g$ at $4 \mathrm { { ~ } ^ { \circ } C }$ for 15 min.Equal amounts of proteins in the supernatant were loaded for $10 \%$ SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto PVDF membrane (PALL,USA).The membranes were blocked with $5 \%$ skim milk for $9 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 \ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ and then incubated with the primary antibodies at the optimal dilutions $( 1 : 1 0 0 0 )$ in $5 \%$ skim milk for $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $3 7 \ \mathrm { { ^ circ C } }$ .After washing with TBS containing $0 . 5 \%$ Tween 20 (TBST),the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody $( 1 : 5 0 0 0 )$ at room temperature for $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .After further washing with TBST,the membrane was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and visualized on X-ray films.The intensities of the protein bands were quantified using Image-Pro Plus software.NF- $\kappa \mathrm { B } 1$ blot values were corrected for GAPDH expression,and the blot values for phosphorylated proteins were corrected for total protein and GAPDH expression.

# Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software package (SPSS Inc,Chicago，IL，USA). The data of cell proliferation was analyzed using One-way ANOVA analysis. The cell apoptosis rate was compared using Chi-square test between the groups. The other numerical data was analyzed using Student's $t$ -test. All tests performed were two-sided.A $P$ value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

# RESULTS

# Effect ofGA-A on HOSand MG-63 cell proliferation

Asshown in Fig.1A, O.1 mmol/L GA-A caused no obvious inhibition of HOS cell growth compared with the control group，while O.25 and O.5mmol/L GA-A significantly inhibited the growth of HOS cells at $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,but not at $2 4 \mathrm { { h } }$ .Similar dose-and time-related inhibitory effects of GA-A were also observed in MG-63 cells (Fig.1B). The $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of GA-A for HOS cells at 24,48 and 72 h was 0.81, 0.51,and $0 . 4 8 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ,and that for MG-63 cells was 0.80,0.50 and $0 . 4 7 ~ \mathrm { \ m m o / L }$ ，respectively.Based on these results,we chose $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ GA-A for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ as the optimal cell treatment condition in the following assays.

# EffectofGA-A on HOS and MG-63 cell apoptosis

Flow cytometric analysis showed that treatment with $0 . 5 \mathrm { \ m m o l / L }$ GA-A for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ significantly increased early cell apoptosis rate as compared with the control samples (Fig.2).In the control and GA-A treatment groups, the early cell apoptosis rates were $( 5 . 4 \pm 1 . 2 ) \%$ and $( 1 6 . 2 \pm 2 . 8 ) \%$ in HOS cells,and were $( 4 . 6 \pm 1 . 4 ) \%$ and $( 1 7 . 6 { \pm } 2 . 1 ) \%$ in MG-63 cells,respectively.

# EffectofGA-AonHOSandMG-63cell invasion

As shown in Fig.3, the number of HOS cells that passed through Matrigel-coated membrane to the lower chamber was significantly lower in GA-A treatment group than in the control group ( $8 1 \pm 2 8$ vs $2 3 3 \pm 4 1$ ， $P <$ 0.05). Similarly，GA-A treatment also significantly lowered the invasive cell number of HOS cells compared with the control cells ( $1 5 0 { \pm } 1 8$ vs $3 3 9 { \pm } 2 3$ $P { < } 0 . 0 5 \$ ）

# EffectofGA-AonexpressionofSTAT3,p38,andNF-kB1

As shown in Fig.4,GA-A treatment significantly decreased p-STAT3 expression levels in both HOS and MG-63 cells by $3 8 . 5 \%$ and 58.8%，respectively. The expression of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and p38 were increased after GA-A treatment by 4.85 folds in HOS cells and by 3.18 folds in MG-63 cells.GA-A treatment also resulted in significant increases in the expression levelof NF- $\mathbf { \nabla } \times \mathbf { B } 1$ in HOS and MG-63 cells by 3.77 and 3.16 folds,respectively.

# DISCUSSION

We demonstrated in this study that GA-A could inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and suppress invasion of human osteosarcoma cells in vitro.So far the effects of GA-A were tested only in colon cancer,gastric cancer,hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells [12.19].In breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, GA-A was foundtosuppressthecellproliferation， colony formation,andinvasivebehaviorss]similartoour findings in the two osteosarcoma cell lines.We explored the possible molecular mechanismsunderlying the inhibitory effects of GA-A and found that GA-A treatment of the cells caused up-regulated expressions of p-p38 and NF-kB1 but down-regulated the expression level of p-STAT3 inboth of the two cell lines.

Compelling evidence supports the critical role of STAT3 activation in regulating tumor cell metastasis, proliferation，.apoptosis,invasion,migrationand angiogenesis20]Persistent activationof STAT3is detected in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines andtumortissues[21.22Severalpreviousstudies demonstrated that inhibition of STAT3 with a dominant negative form of STAT3 or other inhibitors suppressed theproliferation and survival of various cancers [23] According to our results,GA-A can obviously inhibit STAT3 activation by decreasing itsphosphorylation level in osteosarcoma cells.In human hepatic carcinoma HepG2 cells,inhibition of the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway by GA-A enhances the chemosensitivity of cells to cisplatin[13]. These evidences, taken together, revealed that GA-Ais a potential inhibitor of STAT3.

Mitogen-activatedproteinkinases (MAPKs) mediatevariouscellular behaviors in responseto extracellular stimuli. The p38 MAP kinases,one of its main subgroups,have been implicated in a wide range of complex biological processes of cancer cells,such as cellproliferation， differentiation，cell death, cell migration,and invasion [24]．Liang et al[25]examined relationship between gallic acid and $\mathrm { p } 3 8$ signaling pathway in human osteosarcoma cells both in vitro and in vivo,and their findings demonstrated that gallic acid reducedosteosarcomacellviabilitybyinducing apoptosis as a result of activation of the $\mathrm { p } 3 8$ signal pathway.Similar to these results,we found that GA-A could activate the $\mathrm { p } 3 8$ signal pathway,which is involved in the activation $\mathrm { \tilde { N F }  – } \kappa \mathrm { B } ^ { [ \widetilde { 2 6 } ] }$ .We also found that NF- $\mathbf { \nabla \cdot } \mathbf { \kappa } \mathbf { B } 1$ ， a member of NF $\kappa \mathrm { B }$ family,was activated after GA-A treatment. These findings indicate that GA-A suppress osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion and induce cell apoptosis possibly by activating the p38-NF- $\kappa \mathrm { B }$ signal pathway.

In conclusion,we demonstrated that GA-A could inhibit the growth and invasive behaviors and induced cell apoptosis of human osteosarcoma cells.GA-A can simultaneouslyinactivateSTAT3 andactivate p38-NF-kBsignalpathway， andthesesignaling pathways merit further investigation for their potential roles in mediating the effects of GA-A on human osteosarcoma cells.
