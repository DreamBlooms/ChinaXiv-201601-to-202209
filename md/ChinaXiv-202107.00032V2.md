# The Relationships among Structural Social Support, Functional Social Support, and Loneliness in Older Adults: Analysis of Regional Differences based on a Multigroup Structural Equation Model

# Abstract

Objective: This study investigated the relationship between structural social support and loneliness and explored whether functional social support had an intermediate role therein. It also employed a multigroup structural equation model to compare mediation models among older adults living in urban, town, and rural areas.

Methods:Using a self-made demographics questionnaire, the structuralfunctional social support scale,and the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale, this study collected information from 1,325 older adults identified via convenience sampling.

Results: The results showed that: (1) urban and rural elderly had higher structural social support and experienced less loneliness than those of town elderly, whereas the difference of functional social support among urban, town, and rural elderly was not significant. (2) An analysis of the models of regional differences indicated that functional social support served as a full mediator in the relationship between structural social support and loneliness in urban elderly,and a partial mediator for older adults living in towns and rural areas.

Conclusion: The relationship between structural social support and loneliness is mediated by functional social support,and this mediation model varies between urban and town/rural elderly.This study helps us understand possible mechanisms through which structural social support impacts loneliness. It suggests that nursing strategies for older adults should be adjusted according to region and direct greater focus on the function (or quality) of social support network and on town elderly

Keywords: Structural social support, Functional social support, Loneliness, Regional difference, Older adults

# Introduction

Loneliness refers to situations in which a person feels distress, depression and disengagement due to a lack of social or emotional life (Killeen, 1998). Loneliness in older adults is associated with a decline in body function and increase in mortality (Cacioppo et al., 2002; Holwerda et al., 2012; Perissinotto et al., 2012). It is also closely related to the level of depression, psychological distress, and anxiety (Cacioppo et al., 2015; Golden et al., 2009; Paul et al., 2006).

Social support is a factor protecting against loneliness (Chen & Feeley, 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Golden et al., 2009; Zhang & Silverstein, 202O). It can be evaluated from structural (i.e. quantity) and functional (i.e., quality) aspects. Structural supportl refers to the existence and quantity of social relationships within an individual's social network (Sherbourne & Stewart,1991). The density and size of one's social network and frequency of social contact can be used as indicators of structural support (Gallo et al.,2015; Green et al., 2001; Heylen, 2010; Stokes,1985). Functional support is often conceptualized as the perceived availability of support resources, such as material aid, emotional support, companionship or information, from one's social network if needed (Gallo et al., 2O15; Lakey & Cohen, 20OO; Lehto-Järnstedt et al, 2004). Sometimes, functional support is also measured by one's satisfaction with the support available (Davidson et al., 2016).

The convoy model of social relations provides one theoretical basis for this study to investigate the impact of social support on loneliness. According to the convoy model, individuals are surrounded by supportive others who vary in their closeness, e.g.,family members, other relatives, friends, neighbours, and co-workers (Antonucci et al., 2O14). These members not only constitute a support network for the elderly,but also provide the elderly with many kinds of social support (e.g., aid, affect, affirmation exchanges). Therefore, many studies have shown that both structural and functional support can effectively alleviate loneliness in older adults (Cheng et al., 2010; de Jong-Gierveld et al., 2015; Green et al., 2001; Heylen,2010; Kemperman et al., 2019; Pinquart & Sorensen, 2001; Sherbourne & Stewart, 1991; Writtenborn et al., 2O2O). For example, a meta-analysis of 149 articles published from 1948 to 1999 found that both the quality and quantity of social networks were closely related to loneliness (Pinquart & Sorensen, 2O01). Data from 1,414 adults over age 55 in Belgian showed that both the structural (as measured by contact frequency with friends,family,and acquaintances living outside the household and the number of good friends) and functional (as measured by satisfaction with each of the personal social contacts) social relationships significantly affected social loneliness (Heylen, 2010). Study on nursing home residents in Hong Kong found that frequency of contact and functional support (as measured by confiding, showing affection, and advice and guidance from family, other relatives, friends, and staff and fellow residents) were associated with loneliness (Cheng et al., 201O). Another study of 3,799 respondents over age 65 in Canada found that social network size and

composition and satisfaction with network contacts were found to be related to loneliness (de Jong-Gierveld et al., 2O15). Therefore, this study proposed the hypothesis (a): structural and functional support were negatively associated with loneliness.

In addition, according to the convoy model, it is clearly necessary to have some quantity of relationships if one is to have high-quality relationships or to receive different support resources (Antonucci et al., 2O14). Hence, it can be predicted that individuals with higher structural support are more likely to have higher functional support. Montes-Berges and Augusto (2OO7) used Vaux's subjective social support scale to measure the functional support of nurses and the objective social support scale to measure the density of their social networks. The authors found that there was a moderate correlation between the two aspects of social support ( ${ \overset { \cdot } { r } } = 0 . 4 2 { \overset { \cdot } { , } }$ . In addition, research on the social networks of entrepreneurs also found that the frequent contacts with members of the social network significantly correlated with the quality of the relational interaction ( $\stackrel { \cdot } { r } = 0 . 3 1 \$ ) (Pollack et al., 2016). Therefore,this study proposed the hypothesis (b): structural support significantly correlates with functional support.

Another theoretical basis for this study is the theory of socioemotional selectivity which predicts that with increasing age, people attach more importance to the quality of relationships (Carstensen, 1995). Accordingly, many studies have shown that functional support have a stronger prediction on loneliness than does structural support (e.g., Antonucci et al., 2O14; Hawkley et al., 2OO8; Pinquart &

Sorensen, 2OO1; Routasalo et al., 2Oo6). Despite both being related to loneliness, the quality of social network correlated more strongly with loneliness than did the quantity (Pinquart & Sorensen, 2OO1).Loneliness in older adults was found to be closely associated with expectations of and satisfaction with contacts with children and friends, but not with the frequency of these contacts (Routasalo et al., 2006). Another study found that when controlling for the influence of demographic information such as gender, age,and ethnicity,satisfaction with one's social network had stronger prediction on loneliness of older adults than did the social network size (Hawkley et al., 2008).

In conclusion, a higher level of structural support can predict a higher level of functional support, and functional support predicts loneliness better than structural support, so it is speculated that functional support may serve as an intermediary factor between structural support and loneliness. Empirical research has shown that functional support can be used as an intermediary, affecting individuals’ depression and loneliness. For example,Fiori et al. (2OO6) used the perceived quality of social relations as an internal mechanism to explore its mediating role between social support type and depression. The results indicated that perceived quality of social relations partially mediated the association between network type and older adults' depressive symptomatology. Another study focused on the risk factors of loneliness in older adults, finding that satisfaction with their social relations partially mediated the association between the number of social relations and social loneliness (Heylen,

2010). Therefore, this study proposed the hypothesis (c): functional support mediates the relationship between structural support and loneliness.

Besides the close relationship between social support and loneliness, researchers have also paid close attention to the regional differences in social support and loneliness among older adults. The regional differences in loneliness were different in China and other countries. In other countries, many studies have found that rural elderly reported lower level of loneliness than did urban or urban-cluster elderly (Abel et al.,2016 in Uganda; Kaleigh et al.,2019 in the US; Paul et al., 2019 in New Zealand), or urban elderly $( 2 5 . 3 \% )$ had a higher proportion of “lonely" (the score of 3-item UCLA loneliness scale greater than 6 was classified as “lonely") than town/fringe elderly $( 2 1 \% )$ and village elderly $( 2 3 . 1 \% )$ (Victor & Pikhartova, 2020 in England),although two studies in Finnish have shown the opposite results (Savikko et al., 2005; Routasalo et al., 2OO6). However in China, study have found that living in a rural (as opposed to urban) area is a specific factor to the Chinese context and is associated with higher level of loneliness (Yang & Victor,2Oo8). Therefore, studies in China have consistently shown that rural elderly experienced more loneliness than urban elderly (e.g., Su et al., 2015; Wang & Zhou, 201O; Wei, 2012).

When it comes to social support, fewer studies investigated the regional differences of structural and functional support. Therefore, the social support referred below does not completely correspond to structural or functional support. Studies in the UK found that older adults in semi-rural and rural areas participated in more social activities and had stronger network structures (except in terms of friends) than did

those in urban areas (Bowling et al.,1995; Paykel et al.,2O03). Similarly, Baernholdt and colleagues (2O12) found that older adults in rural areas had larger family support networks but smaller friend and religious support networks than did those in ruralurban adjacent and urban areas. However,a study conducted in Iowa have found that there was no differences in the size of social network, the frequency of social interaction, the amount of instrumental support, and the subjective level of social support between urban and rural elderly (Evans, 2009).

In China, many studies used the Social Support Rating Scale(SSRS) to measure social support from objective and subjective dimensions (Xiao,1994). Objective support measures an individual's living arrangement and sources of social support. Whereas subjective support refers to an individual's emotional experience and satisfaction of being respected and supported. It is measured by the closeness with family members,friends,and neighbours. Although objective support and structural support, and subjective support and functional support differ in definitions and are measured in different ways,we can roughly regard objective support as structural support and subjective support as functional support. Most studies have found that compared to rural elderly, urban elderly had higher level of objective (structural) support and subjective (functional) support (e.g., Gao et al.,2O2O; Mao et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2O16). However,some studies found that objective (structural) support of rural elderly was significantly higher than that of urban elderly (Li et al.,2O13; Zeng, 2006),and subjective (functional) support had no difference between urban and rural elderly (Zeng, 2006).

Because oI tne inconsistency ol aeIinitions and measurement tools,it 1s nard to draw a unified conclusion on the regional differences of structural and functional support in China.In addition, the way some studies simply divided the elderly into urban and rural groups may weaken the conclusion of these studies. In China, in order to facilitate administrative management, regions are divided into three categories: provincial, municipal, and county/town level (The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, 2Oo5). Rural areas are generally subordinate to and managed by towns. Thus, some studies classified older adults who were investigated in town and rural areas into a single group as rural elderly (Li et al., 2O13; Wang et al., 2016; Wang & Zhou, 201O; Zeng, 2006). However, the last two decades of urbanization in China have led to differences in rural, town, and urban politics, economies,cultures,and environments. It is possible that there are differences in social support and loneliness between town and rural elderly. Therefore, the differences of structural support, functional support, and loneliness among urban, town,and rural elderly in China are still unclear. Nevertheless, according to the previous literature, this study still proposed the hypothesis (d): urban elderly reported less loneliness than town and rural elderly,and the hypothesis (e): urban elderly had higher structural and functional support than town and rural elderly. Based on the hypotheses of this study, after testing the mediating effect of functional support, this study will further explore the regional differences of this mediating effect.

In sum,in the context of China's urbanization, this study explores the mediating role of functional support in the relationship between structural support and loneliness in the elderly. To explore the regional differences of this mediating effect, we used a multigroup structural equation model (SEM) to compare the models among older adults in urban, town, and rural areas.

# Method

# Participants

Data collection commenced after obtaining ethical clearance to conduct the study from the School of Psychology,Fujian Normal University. This study employed summer college students to collect data. A group of 1,424 older adults were collected by means of convenience sampling. Participants were recruited from 11 provinces or province-level municipality in China, including Anhui, Beijing, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong,Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Shanxi, Yunnan,and Zhejiang. All participants were asked to sign an informed consent form and then complete a questionnaire and face-to-face interview. Individuals had to: (1) be aged $\geq 6 0$ years, (2) have no missing questions on their questionnaires, except those requesting demographic information. Of the total, 99 participants were excluded, thereby making the effective rate as high as $93 \%$ . The remaining 1,325 participants were distributed among urban $( \mathrm { n } = 3 9 3 )$ ),town $( { \bf n } = 3 3 0 )$ ), and rural ( $\mathrm { { \acute { n } } } = 6 0 2 \$ ） areas, with a mean age of 69.27 years ( $S D = 6 . 9 2$ ; age range $= 6 0 – 9 7$ years); $4 6 . 6 \%$ were male. Some participants did not respond to items about their demographic information, such as age $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 2 )$ ，gender $\mathrm { ( n = 6 ) }$ , education level $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 2 )$ ), living arrangement $( \mathrm { n } = 7 )$ ,and economic satisfaction $\mathbf { \Psi } ( \mathbf { n } = 1 \mathbf { \Psi } )$ ）

# Measures

Structural-functional social support scale: Almquist et al. (2O17) were the first to extract nine items from two dimensions of the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (ISSI; Henderson et al., 198O) to measure structural and functional social support. The four items of structural support were taken from the Availability of Social Integration on the ISSI. These included: (1) How many people who share your interests do you know and have contact with? (2) How many people do you know that you meet or talk to during a week? (3) How many friends do you have who can visit you in your home and feel “at home"? and (4) How many people can you speak openly with? For each of these items, the response options were: (1) None, (2) 1-2, (3) 3-5,(4) 6-10,(5) 11-15,and (6) More than 15.Higher mean scores indicated more structural support or a larger social network. The five items of functional support were extracted from the Availability of Attachment on the ISSI. These included: (1) There is someone special who I really feel supports me,(2) There is someone special who is close to me,(3) Others appreciate what I do for them, (4) There are people around me who I can easily ask for favours,and (5) There are other persons outside my family that are close to me and that I can turn to in times of hardship. The response options for each item were:(1) Disagree completely,(2) Disagree,(3) Agree, and (4) Agree completely. The higher the mean score, the higher the functional support people perceived. Measurement of functional support in this study was measured on five levels, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. A "Neither agree nor disagree" option was set in the middle to make the choices more in line with the Chinese cultural background (Lee et al., 2002; Si & Cullen, 1998; Zhao et al., 2017).

To ensure the validity of these items, this study used Amos 22.0 to construct a twofactor SEM for confirmatory factor analysis,which yielded the following outputs: $\chi _ { 5 I } ^ { 2 }$ $= 1 8 5 . 8 0 7 , d f = 2 6 , p < . 0 0 1 ; \chi _ { s t } ^ { 2 } \enspace / \thinspace \mathrm { d f } = 7 . 1 4 7 ; \mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 9 3 9 ; \mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 5 6 ; \mathrm { P C F I } = 1 . 9 3 6 ;$ $0 . 6 9 0 ; \mathrm { R M S E A } = 0 . 0 6 8 ( \mathrm { C I } _ { 9 0 } = 0 . 0 5 9 , 0 . 0 7 8 )$ , indicating the model was acceptable (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The Cronbach's $\mathfrak { a }$ of structural and functional support in this study were 0.774 and 0.813, respectively

The 3-item UCLA loneliness scale: The 3-item UCLA loneliness scale was compiled by Hughes et al. (2OO4). It contains only three items: (1) How often do you feel that you lack companionship? (2) How often do you feel left out? and (3) How often do you feel isolated from others? Participants respond regarding the frequency of the above experiences. The options include: (1) Hardly ever,(2) Some of the time, and (3) Often.Loneliness scores are between 3 and 9. The higher the score, the stronger the loneliness people feel. In this study, the Cronbach's $\mathfrak { a }$ for the scale was 0.799.

# Statistical analysis

All analyses were conducted using SPSS 19.0 and AMOS 22.0. Frequencies and cross-tabulations gave the distribution of socio-demographic variables,while means and standard deviations showed the scores of structural support, functional support, and loneliness in older adults in urban, town, and rural areas.A Pearson correlation was used to establish correlations,while a one-way ANOVA was employed to explore the regional differences among these study variables.A SEM with latent variables was used to evaluate whether functional support mediated the relationship between structural support and loneliness. Then,a SEM with a multigroup analysis was used to assess the regional differences of the mediation models in urban, town, and rural elderly.

For the SEM, the $\chi ^ { 2 }$ statistic is usually significant in large sample studies, often causing researchers to reject appropriate models that should be accepted (Kenny, 2O15). Therefore, this study used other fit indices,including the comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI),and approximate root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). A good model fit is achieved if the CFI and TLI values are above .9O and RMSEA value ranges from .O5 to .O8, providing a reasonable and appropriate fit (Kline, 2O1O). For the multigroup SEM, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the Expected Cross-validation Index (ECVI) were used to verify the measurement invariance across models in different regions.When multiple models in the results are fit, the model with the smallest AIC and ECVI values is the most suitable (Wu, 2010).

# Results

# Descriptive statistics

The data on the socio-demographics of participants by residence place are presented in Table 1. The mean ages of the different groups and total sample were all around 69 years,and nearly half of the total sample was female. For education level, about half $( 5 1 . 4 \% )$ of the total had primary school and below,with $2 7 . 3 \%$ and $2 1 . 2 \%$ having had secondary and high school (and above), respectively. Older adults in rural areas had a greater proportion $( 6 8 . 1 \% )$ of primary school and below than did older adults living in cities $( 4 0 . 5 \% )$ and towns $( 3 3 . 9 \% )$ . The majority of the sample $( 7 5 . 6 \% )$ was married, regardless of residence type.In terms of economic condition, $3 8 . 9 \%$ of the total sample rated their economic condition as“Satisfied” or“Very satisfied," $1 5 . 4 \%$ rated it as “Dissatisfied” or“Very dissatisfied,” and $4 5 . 6 \%$ rated it as “Just so-so.” Among the three regions,a higher proportion of urban elderly reported satisfaction with their economic condition $( 5 1 . 9 \% )$ than did town and rural elderly (around $3 3 \%$ of older adults for both areas).

[Table1 nearhere]

Table 2 shows the mean values of structural support, functional support, and loneliness in urban, town, and rural elderly. A one-way ANOVA showed that there were significant differences in the structural support of older adults among diferent regions, $F = 5 . 1 4 5$ ， $p = 0 . 0 0 6$ . A post-hoc analysis using the least significant difference (LSD) test indicated that the level of structural support for town elderly was significantly lower than that of rural ( $( p = 0 . 0 0 2 )$ andurban ( ${ \mathrm { \Delta } } p = 0 . 0 0 9 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ elderly, but there was no significant difference between rural and urban elderly. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the functional support among the older adults dwelling in all three regions. Loneliness for each group differed significantly, $F =$ 30.694, $p < . 0 0 1$ . A post-hoc analysis indicated that the loneliness of urban elderly was significantly lower than that of town $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ and rural $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ elderly, and the loneliness of rural elderly was significantly lower than that of town elderly $( p = . 0 1 )$

[Table 2 near here.]

# Bivariate correlations

Table 3 presents the Spearman's correlations among the study variables. The results showed that structural and functional support were positively correlated with one another,and both were negatively correlated with loneliness. The results of a Fisher r-to-z transformation indicated that the correlation between structural support and loneliness in urban elderly was significantly lower than that of town and rural elderly ( $\mathrm { Z r } = 2 . 0 6$ $p = . 0 3 9 ,$ ）

[Table3 nearhere.]

# Mediation analysis of functional support

A SEM with mediation pathways was created to evaluate whether functional support represented mechanisms through which structural support might impact loneliness among older adults; this was accomplished by performing bootstrapping to calculate $9 5 \%$ bias-corrected confidence intervals for indirect effects.

The result showed that the total effect of structural support on loneliness (standardized total effect $= - . 2 9 0$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r .$ ） was significant. An indirect pathway existed between structural support and loneliness via functional support (standardized indirect effect $= - . 1 3 2$ $p = . 0 0 5 ,$ . The direct effect of structural support on loneliness (standardized direct effect $= - . 1 5 8$ $p = . 0 0 5 ,$ ） was also significant in the mediation model, indicating that functional support partially mediated the relationship between structural support and loneliness. The model fit indices indicated an acceptable fit, $\chi _ { 5 1 } ^ { 2 }$ = 241.939, $p < . 0 0 1$ ， $\mathrm { C F I } = . 9 6 2 \$ ,TLI $\ c =$ .951, RMSEA $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { \tau }$ .053 (C190 = .047, .060). The size of the indirect effect via functional support was $8 3 . 5 4 \%$ (-.132/ -.158) of that direct effect. For more detail, see Figure 1.

[Figure 1 near here.]

# Multigroup SEM: Measurement invariance

The regional differences of relationships among structural support, functional support, and loneliness were examined using SEM with a multigroup analysis. First, measurement invariance was verified by two models that gradually added constraints. Model 1 was a configural model with free paths between each group. The model fit indices indicated an adequate fit, $\chi ^ { 2 } = 3 7 2 . 9 5 2 , d f = 1 5 3 , \mathrm { C F I } = . 9 5 7 , \mathrm { T L I } = . 9 4 4 ,$ （20号 RMSEA $\ c =$ .033 $( \mathbf { C l } _ { 9 0 } = . 0 2 9 \$ , .037),AIC = 606.952,ECVI $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { \tau }$ .459. Model 2 was a measurement weights model with equal factor loadings on all groups. The model fit indices were also acceptable, $\chi ^ { 2 } = 4 0 1 . 3 9 8 , d f = 1 7 1 , \mathrm { C F I } = . 9 5 5 , \mathrm { T L I } = . 9 4 7 ,$ ,RMSEA $\mathbf { \tau } = . 0 3 2$ $\mathrm { \cdot } \mathrm { C l } _ { 9 0 } = . 0 2 8$ , .036), $\mathrm { A I C } = 5 9 9 . 3 9 8 , \mathrm { E C V I } = . 4 5 3$ .Comparisons across models showed that the increase in chi-squared values $( \Delta \chi ^ { 2 } = 2 8 . 4 4 6$ $p = . 0 5 6 )$ was not statistically significant and changes in other model fit indices were small, indicating robust measurement consistency across the urban, town, and rural groups used in this research. In this study, the model with the smaller AIC and ECVI values,i.e., the equal measurement weights model (Model 2) was used as the most suitable model in the subsequent multigroup analysis.

# Multigroup comparison

According to residence place, the sample was divided into urban, town, and rural groups. The path coefficients of each model were compared by critical ratios for differences (CRD) between parameters to explore regional differences in the mediating effect of functional support (see Table 4, Figure 2). If the CRD between parameters is greater than 1.96, the two parameters are significantly different (Jang & Kim,2O18). The results showed that: (1) functional support fully mediated the relationship between structural support and loneliness in urban elderly. The size of the indirect effect via functional support was $9 8 . 1 7 \%$ (-.107 / -.109) of that direct effect. However, (2) functional support partially mediated the impact of structural support on loneliness in older adults residing in town and rural areas. The mediation effect accounted for $6 6 . 8 1 \%$ and $8 5 . 1 6 \%$ of the total effect, respectively. (3) Comparing the path coeficients of the three models,it was determined that structural support for town elderly had a greater prediction on functional support than did the same support for rural elderly.

[Table 4 near here.] [Figure 2 near here.]

# Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of structural support on loneliness and the mediation role of functional support in this relationship. Multigroup analysis was used to compare the mediation models among older adults in urban, town,and rural areas. The results showed that: (1) structural support for older adults in rural and urban areas was higher than for town elderly. Functional support showed no significant differences among older adults in the three regions. Loneliness of urban elderly was significantly less than that of town and rural elderly, and loneliness of

rural elderly was significantly less than that of town elderly. (2) In general, the impact of structural support on loneliness of older adults was partially achieved through functional support. The mediation effect accounted for $8 3 . 5 4 \%$ of the total effect. (3) There are regional differences in the mediating effect of functional support. Specifically, functional support for urban elderly fully mediated the relationship between structural support and loneliness. The mediation effect accounted for $9 8 . 1 7 \%$ of the total effect. However, functional support for older adults in town and rural areas partially mediated the impact of structural support on loneliness. The mediation effect accounted for $6 6 . 8 1 \%$ and $8 5 . 1 6 \%$ of the total effect, respectively.

This study found that urban elderly experienced less loneliness than did town and rural elderly, a conclusion that supported the hypothesis (d). This result is consistent with the results found in previous studies (e.g., Su et al., 2O15; Wang & Zhou, 2O1O; Wei, 2O12). The novel finding was rural elderly experienced less loneliness than did town elderly (the following explanation for regional difference of structural support can also explain this result). However, the regional differences of social support did not fully validate the hypothesis (e). Structural support for older adults in urban, town, and rural areas showed a V-shaped relationship that urban and rural elderly had higher structural support than town elderly, whereas functional support had no significant differences among the three groups. For the result of lower structural support in town elderly, we tried to explain it from the basis of social support in different regions. The social support in rural areas tends to be based on blood relationships,whereas the social support in urban areas tends to be based on

professional relationships (Zhu & Shao, 2Oo5). However, due to the influence of urbanization, the blood relationships had been destroyed, while the professional relationships had not been fully established in towns (Cai, 2Oo5; Li et al., 2012). Therefore, the structural support for town elderly was lower than that for urban and rural elderly. A recent study classifying respondents (who are not limited to the elderly) as living in rural, town,or urban areas found the same V-shaped relationship that compared with urban and rural residents,residents living in towns reported less social support (Wang et al., 2O15), supporting the above explanation. However, inconsistent with the hypothesis (e), functional support had no differences among older adults living in urban, town,and rural areas. This result could be explained by the socioemotional selectivity theory, which proposed that older adults tend to pay more attention to more intimate and satisfying relationships than they did when they were younger (Carstensen, 1995). Therefore, no matter where older adults live, they tend to focus on the quality of their social support.

As for the relationship between social support and loneliness, this study found that functional support played a partial mediating role in the impact of structural support on loneliness. This result not only verified our hypotheses (a, b,and c), but also supported the prediction of the convoy model of social relations. As previous studies have shown, the size, composition, and frequency of social support can affect loneliness (e.g., Cheng et al., 201O; de Jong-Gierveld et al., 2015; Kemperman et al., 2019; Writtenborn et al., 2O2O). Therefore, structural support can directly predict loneliness in the elderly. Moreover, structural support can indirectly impact loneliness via functional support. Higher structural support suggests that older adults may have multiple social roles in their social network and therefore can obtain more and higherquality social connectedness and integration (Moen, 2Oo1). Older adults can also gain a sense of belonging from their social identity (Dutton et al., 1994), eventually reducing their loneliness.

Furthermore,this study found the regional differences of the mediating effect. Specifically,functional support for urban elderly fully mediated,and for town and rural elderly partially mediated, the impact of structural support on loneliness. This result can be explained by social support for older adults in different regions relying on different social groups. Researchers have found that rural residents are more likely to seek support from spouses and relatives,while urban residents are more likely to seek support from friends and colleagues (Cai et al., 1997; Zhu & Shao, 2005). Despite changes stemming from reform and opening up, China's rural economy still considers the family to be the basic unit of social production. The strong economic relationship between family members collaborating in production increases their dependence on one another in all aspects of their daily lives (Cai et al., 1997). Many generations of rural families in China still live together under the same roof. Such a large-scale,long-term, stable social network can ensure that rural elderly have both a satisfactory quantity and quality of social support, jointly reducing their loneliness. Compared with the similarities found between urban and town elderly, town and rural elderly are closer in trms of living conditions such as employment opportunities,

income levels, living standards, etc. Therefore, the impact pattern of social support on loneliness is similar for town and rural elderly.

However, unlike rural and town households,urban households have lost the function of production. Urban residents are more inclined to obtain social support from professional ties (such as colleagues, friends,etc.) (Fang & Hu, 2OO3; Zhu & Shao,2Oo5). This suggests that urban residents’ social support is easily affected by occupational changes. Compared with town and rural residents,urban residents, especially urban youth, have greater instability in terms of their employment and change their addresses more frequently (He,1991). Therefore, the social networks of urban elderly are unstable and their social support structures are often destroyed. Faced with such situations, urban older adults often take the initiative, accepting and adjusting to their social networks and focusing their time and energy on cultivating higher-quality social support. Therefore, only when their social support based on professional ties is of a high quality is it possible to effectively relieve urban older adults' loneliness.

In addition, through a multigroup SEM, as compared to rural elderly, the structural support for town elderly was found to predict their functional support better. In other words, the same amount of structural support can provide town elderly with more psychological satisfaction than what would be experienced by rural elderly. The perceived discrepancy hypothesis of loneliness based on cognitive theory proposes that the degree of loneliness depends not only on actual social relations, but also on the individual’s expectations of these relations (Perlman & Peplau,1998). That is,

loneliness is a subjective feeling that occurs when there is a discrepancy between individuals' actual and expected social relations. To avoid loneliness and minimize this perceived discrepancy, people can not only modify their expectations on social relations,but also achieve sufficient social support to balance the two (Burholt et al., 2017). According to the results of the present study, compared to rural elderly, town elderly not only experienced more loneliness, but also had less structural support. In the face of this unfavourable situation, town elderly may actively adjust their expectations to reduce the discrepancy and give full value to everyone in their social network to meet their needs. Therefore,as opposed to rural elderly, the structural support of town elderly predicted their functional social support better. Of course, this inference needs to be verified in future research.

In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that functional support plays a mediating role in the relationship between structural support and loneliness. The importance of this study is the division of older adults into three categories,according to their place of residence.This work shows that older adults from different regions have different levels of structural support and loneliness,and the mediation model is different between urban and town/rural elderly. This study will help researchers better understand how different types of social support interact to decrease loneliness in older adults, suggesting that nursing strategies for older adults in different regions should be focused differently, with the emphasis on the function of social support and older adults living in towns.
