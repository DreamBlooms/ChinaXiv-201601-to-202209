# INTRODUCTION

As an important industrial product,graphite film has been used as thermal diffusion material,heat resistant sealing material, gasket,electromagnetic interference shielding material,and separator for fuel cell because of its excellent resistance to heat and chemicals,high thermal diffusion property,high electrical conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient,and low permeability of gasses.1-5 For example, electronic devices,as represented bya personal computer and a portable telephone,have been requested to have higher performance and smaller size in recent years.With this request,the performance and density of electronic components are increased.But conversely, the amount of generated heat tends to be larger and the space where a fan should be inserted is limited.Thus,graphite film with high thermal diffusion property has been regarded as a satisfying choice and used in a variety of electronic devices.5

For the present,commercially available graphite film could be manufactured by an expansion method in which expanded graphite is compressed and a pyrolysis method in which carbonization of carbon precursors (such as polyimide,polyoxadiazole,polyphenylenevinylene,polybenzooxazole,and polyamide) and then graphitization are performed.7 Compared with graphite film obtained by the expansion method,graphite film obtained by the pyrolysis method has higher thermal diffusivity, mechanical strength,and flexibility. Furthermore,it is easy to produce a thin graphite film having a thickness of $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ or less through the pyrolysis method,which is difficult to achieve through the expansion method.7 However, the graphitization process in the pyrolysis method always requires long-time heat treatment at extremely high temperature.4

Many researchers have already noted that the graphitization process of carbon could be accelerated in the presence of some additives.8-14 Noda et al. studied the graphitization process of coke with calcium hydroxide as a catalyst,and they found the graphitization of coke started at a temperature as low as $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the coexistence of calcium hydroxide. This result was amazing because the coke graphitize only above $2 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ without additive under atmospheric pressure.Matsuo and Fuertes indicated that Ni wasa very effective catalyst to convert carbon into graphite at low temperature.13,14 However, the residual additives are usually harmful for the further application of graphite.12

The graphitization process of carbon could also be accelerated under external pressureor internal stres.15,16 The graphitization of carbons under external pressure was first shown using a carbon derived from coke at a temperature of $1 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under a pressure of 1 GPa.17 Subsequent study showed that the pressure could be reduced to $0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { \ G P a }$ 18 Furthermore，even carbons which are nongraphitizable under atmospheric pressure,such as a carbon derived from phenolic resin,can also be converted to graphite at around $1 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under pressure.19 Experimentally, it has been proven that the internal stress can develop in composites of reinforcements and carbon precursors during the carbonization process of carbon precursors and then accelerate the graphitizationprocessofcarbonprecursors.2However because the internal stress accumulated in the carbon precursors decreases as the distance from the reinforcement increases,the acceleration of graphitization tends to occur at the interface between reinforcements and carbon precursors.16,20,22

Graphene is a single layer of graphite and is one of the stiffest (modulus ${ \sim } 1 \mathrm { T P a }$ ）and strongest (strength ${ \sim } 1 0 0$ GPa）materials.23,24 It is reasonable to assume that,accumulation of internal stress could also occur in composites of graphene and carbon precursors during the carbonization process of carbon precursors, which ultimately accelerates the graphitization process of the carbon precursors.What is more,graphene has a high specific surfacearea,2ä which could generate suffcient stress centers to achieve a high graphitization degree of carbon precursors at low temperature.It is well-known that Kapton (registered tradename, EI du Pont de Nemours & Co.）synthesized from pyromellitic dianhydride（PMDA） and $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -oxydianiline(ODA）isa commerciallyavailable polyimide filmand iswidely used as a carbon precursor for the preparation of graphite film.It has simple carbonization and graphitization behaviors but requires very high temperature (usual in a temperature range of $2 8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ or higher) to transform into high quality graphite film.26-28For reasons noted above,in the present study,a composite was prepared,in which graphene was chosen as the reinforcement and aromatic polyimide PMDA/ODA was chosen as the carbon precursor. The graphitization behavior of the polyimide in the composite was systematically investigated to clarify the effect of graphene on it.

# EXPERIMENTAL

# Materials

PMDA and ODA were purified by sublimation in vacuum. $\boldsymbol { N } , \boldsymbol { N } ^ { \prime }$ -dimethylacetamide(DMAc）was distilled under vacuum over calcium hydride $( \mathrm { C a H } _ { 2 } )$ and stored over $4 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ molecular sieves.Thermally exfoliated graphene with a specific surface area of $7 5 8 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { g } ,$ ，an average thickness of $0 . 9 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，anda $\mathrm { C } / \mathrm { O }$ atomic ratio of 5.0 was prepared according to the method described in our previous work.29

# Measurements

Fourier transform infrared(FTIR）spectra were recorded with a Thermo Nicolet 67oo FTIR spectrometer. The dispersion and distribution of thermally exfoliated graphene in the polyimide matrix were studied with a Tecnai F2O transmission electron microscopy（TEM） at an accelerating voltage of $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { k V } .$ Before the TEM observation,the polyimide/graphene composite film was embedded in the epoxy resin and then cut into ultrathin slices with thickness of $7 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . The apparent densities of polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films heat-treated at different temperatures were calculated from film thickness,area, and weight. The X-ray diffraction (XRD）measurement of the polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films heat-treated at different temperatures was undertaken on a Bruker D8 Advance with Cu $\mathrm { K } \boldsymbol { \alpha }$ radiation $( 4 0 \ \mathrm { k V } , \ 4 0 \ \mathrm { m A }$ ）atascanning rate of $5 ^ { \circ } / \mathrm { m i n }$ from 5 to $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ . The cross-section morphologies of the polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films heattreated at different temperatures were observed with Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM).

# Preparation of Polyimide Film

ODA $\left( 2 . 0 0 2 4 \ \mathrm { g } , \ 1 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ ,PMDA $\left( 2 . 1 8 1 2 ~ \mathrm { g } , ~ 1 0 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ ,and driedDMAc( $\mathrm { \Delta } 6 0 \ \mathrm { m L }$ ）were added into a flask and the mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere After $^ { 2 4 \ \mathrm { h } , }$ the resulting viscous poly(amic acid） solution was cast onto a glass plate. The glass plate was placed in an oven at $5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to slowly remove most of the solvent under flowing air and then subjected to scheduled heating at l0o,20o,300,and $3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ at each temperature under flowing nitrogen. After slow cooling to room temperature,the resulting film was released from the glass surface by being soaked in water.

# Preparation of Polyimide/Graphene Composite Film

Thermally exfoliated graphene $( 0 . 2 0 9 2 \ \mathrm { g } )$ was dispersed in dried DMAc $( 2 1 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m L } )$ ）byultrasonication for $^ \mathrm { ~ 3 ~ h ~ }$ ，Then，ODA $\mathrm { ( 2 . 0 0 2 4 ~ g , ~ 1 0 . 0 ~ m m o l ) }$ ）andPMDA $\left( 2 . 1 8 1 2 ~ \mathrm { g } , ~ 1 0 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere.After $2 4 \ \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，about $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m L }$ DMAc was removed by vacuum distillation and the resulting viscous poly(amic acid） solution was cast onto a glass plate. The glass plate was subjected to the same heat treatment as that given to the polyimide film described earlier.

# Heat Treatment of Polyimide and Polyimide/Graphene Composite Films

The prepared polyimide film and polyimide/graphene composite film were cut into a square shape and sandwiched between polished artificial graphite plates.Then,they were heated to $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at a heating rate of $5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / \mathrm { m i n }$ and carbonized at the temperature for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ in a flow of nitrogen.After cooling to room temperature, the carbonized filmswere sandwiched again between polished artificial graphite plates and heated at 1500, 1800,and $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ in a flow of nitrogen.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

# Preparation of Polyimide andPolyimide/Graphene Composite Films

The polyimide film was prepared in accordance with the conventional two-step method by the polycondensation reaction of dianhydride PMDA and diamine ODA to form poly(amic acid) followed by thermal imidization.The preparation of polyimide/ graphene composite film was to achieve controlled graphene dispersion and distribution in the polyimide matrix.Typically, three approaches are commonly adopted to prepare polymer/ graphene composites: solution mixing,melt blending,and in situ polymerization.30 Considering that the polyimide PMDA/ ODAis infusible and insoluble because of its rigid chain structure and strong interchain interaction,the in situ polymerization was used for the preparation of polyimide/graphene composite film. Scheme 1 demonstrates the steps.The weight percent of the thermally exfoliated graphene was 5 wt $\%$ with respect to the dianhydride and diamine monomers.Suspension of the thermally exfoliated graphene in DMAc $\mathrm { ( 1 . 0 ~ m g / m L ) }$ was first prepared by ultrosonication treatment,and then mixed with PMDA and ODA.After being stirred for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，excess of solvent was distilled off to obtain viscous poly(amic acid)/ graphene solution,which was then cast on glass and imidized. The complete imidization of poly(amic acid) was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The resulting polyimide film and polyimide/ graphene composite film had a thickness of around $3 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ .The dispersion and distribution of the thermally exfoliated graphene in polyimide matrix was investigated by TEM.As indicated by the TEM micrograph in Figure 1,graphene sheets were homogeneously dispersed in polyimide matrix and there were almost no large aggregates.Furthermore,obvious orientation of graphene sheets along the film surface was observed.This could be attributed to the high thermal expansion coefficient of glass, which induced the orientation of polyimide molecular chains and also graphene sheets during imidization.26

# Physical Changes During Heat Treatment of Polyimide and Polyimide/Graphene Composite Films

The prepared polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films were carbonized at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ ，and then these films were further subjected to heat treatment at l5oo,l8oo,and $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ in a flow of nitrogen.After heat treatment at different temperatures,films without any appreciable cracks were obtained.The color of heat-treated polyimide films was shiny black,while the heat-treated polyimide/graphene composite films showed silvery luster.

Many researchers have so far studied the pyrolysis behavior of polyimide PMDA/ODA,and some decomposition mechanisms have been already proposed.31-34 During pyrolysis, several thermally controlled chemical reactions take place,such as bond cleavage,release of gaseous byproducts (CO, $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ， $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { . }$ $\Nu _ { 2 }$ ，and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { , }$ ),intermolecular coupling,and intramolecular coupling.As a result of these various chemical reactions,the polyimide exhibits weight loss and dimension change during heat treatment.The changes in weights of polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films with heat treatment temperature are shown in Figure 2. The weight loss pattern of the polyimide/ graphene composite film followed the weight loss pattern exhibited by pure polyimide film.As prepared graphene had higher char yield than polyimide,polyimide/graphene composite film showed higher residual weight than polyimide film when was heated at the same temperature.

Figure 3 shows plots of shrinkages in the direction parallel to the film surface versus heat treatment temperature for the polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films.After heat treatment at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ } }$ ，the polyimide film showed shrinkage in the direction parallel to the film surface of $2 1 . 8 \%$ ，which was almost the same as the data of commercial Kapton film reported by others.31 In fact, for polyimide PMDA/ODA,its shrinkage in the direction parallel to the film surface mainly occurred over a rather narrow temperature range of $5 5 0 { - } 6 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ 31 So,when the temperature was further increased to above $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ the shrinkage change in the direction parallel to the film surface was small.For polyimide/graphene composite film,the shrinkage in the direction parallel to the film surface was about $1 4 \%$ after heat treatment at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ and remained nearly constant when further heated to higher temperature,showing much lower shrinkage than the polyimide film.From the TEM micrograph of polyimide/graphene composite film in Figure l,there wasa preferred orientation of tough and rigid graphene parallel to the film surface,which should be responsible for the lower shrinkage of polyimide/graphene composite film.

Figure 3.Shrinkages in the direction parallel to the film surface versus heat treatment temperature for polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films.

Figure 4 shows plots of shrinkages in the direction perpendicular to the film surface versus heat treatment temperature for the polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films.For both samples,their shrinkages in the direction perpendicular to the film surface increased as the heat treatment temperature increased. This trend was also reported by Bourgerette et al.35 Compared with the polyimide film,the polyimide/graphene composite film showed much higher shrinkage in the direction perpendicular to the film surface after heat treatment at $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ } }$ .As graphitization is a process of improving the stacking regularity that is accompanied by volume decrease and a tremendous decrease in thickness of commercial Kapton film was observed during its graphitization process,1 s,15,16,35 the above phenomenon indicated that the polyimide in the polyimide/graphene composite film may experience some degreeof graphitization at $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the assistance of graphene.

Figure 5.Density versus heat treatment temperature for polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films.

Figure 5 shows plots of densities versus heat treatment temperature for the polyimide and polyimide/graphene composite films. The measured density of polyimide film was $1 . 3 9 \ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ . It was in good agreement with the value of commercial Kapton film $( 1 . 4 2 ~ \mathrm { \ g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ .36 The polyimide/graphene composite film also had similar density $( 1 . 4 1 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ to the pure polyimide film. Forboth samples, their density increased from around $1 . 4 0 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ to around $1 . 6 0 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ after heat treatment at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ .In the range $1 0 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ ，their densities decreased significantly (from around 1.60 to $1 . 3 2 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ．The downward trend in density with increasing heat treatment temperature was also reported by Kipling and Zaldivar,and they attributed this to the result of formation of micropore.21,37After being heattreated at $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ ，the density of polyimde/graphene composite film increased to $1 . 6 5 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ ，which was much higher than the corresponding value of polyimide film $( 1 . 3 6 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ： Graphitization is a process of transforming disordered carbon structure into perfectly stacked graphite,which is highly crystalline and has a theoretical density of $2 . 2 6 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ .38 The higher density of $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ -treated polyimide/graphene composite film than $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ -treated polyimide filmalso indicated that the polyimide in the composite may experience some degree of graphitization at this temperature with the assistance of graphene.21

# XRD Studies of Heat-Treated Polyimide and Polyimide/ Graphene Composite Films

XRD is an important characterization for determining the crystal structure of graphite,which is constituted by thousands of gra phene sheet layers.But for exfoliated graphene and graphene dispersed well in polymer matrix,their layer-stacking regularity almost disappeared.As a result,no diffraction peak can be observed from their XRD patterns.39,40 In the study, thermally exfoliated graphene was dispersed well in the polyimide matrix. So,the XRD measurement could be used to characterize the graphitization process of polyimide in the polyimide/graphene composite film.Figure 6 shows the (Oo2） diffraction peaks of pol yimide/graphene composite film in comparison with that of polyimide film.The polyimide film had a broad and weak Oo2 profile, even though it was heat-treated to $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，However,when the polyimide/graphene composite film was heat-treated to $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ its (O02） diffraction peak increased suddenly and was sharp.

Ideal graphite crystal is known to have an interlayer spacing of $0 . 3 3 5 4 \ \mathrm { n m }$ 16 According to the Bragg equation,41'the interlayer spacing of $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ -treated polyimide/graphene composite was $0 . 3 3 8 6 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ．Although the interlayer spacing of $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ -treated polyimide/graphene composite was higher than that of ideal graphite crystal,according to the result of Konno et al.,for polyimide PMDA/ODA imidized on glass,to decrease the interlayer spacing to $0 . 3 3 8 6 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ,the heat treatment temperature should be increased to about $2 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 42 So,with the asstance of graphene, the graphitization process of polyimide could be accelerated.

# SEM Observations of Heat-Treated Polyimide and Polyimide/ Graphene Composite Films

Graphitization,involving the joining of smaller segments of graphite layer plane together to form larger layer plane which is then translated into a proper stacking registry with neighboring layer planes,refers to a development of the three-dimensional graphite-like structure in the initially two-dimensionally ordered carbon.43,44 Figure 7 shows the cross-section morphologies of polyimide film heat-treated at $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and polyimide/graphene composite film heat-treated at l0oo and $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 、Photos (d), (e),and(f)are the enlargements of each area surrounded by a black line in photos (a),(b)，and (c)，respectively. For polyi mide/graphene composite film,the graphene sheets were distinguishable from the polyimide matrix,and the change in the morphology of polyimide matrix with heat treatment temperature was shown clearly.After heat treatment at $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ large lamellar region could be observed clearly by the enlarge ment,which was indicative of formation of graphitic structure.21 But for $2 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ -treatedpolyimide film,no lamellar texture could be found and the matrix remained amorphous. The result also indicated that graphene played an important role in accelerating the graphitization process of the polyimide.

# Mechanism for Acceleration in Graphitization Process of Polyimide/Graphene Composite

Many previous studies have shown that,internal stress could be developed in composites of reinforcements and carbon precursors during the carbonization process of carbon precursors,which could be used to accelerate the graphitization process of carbon precursors.1522is isausemotbprecusos a large amount of shrinkage during carbonization,while the reinforcements aredimensionally stable.The shrinkageof carbon precursors could be partially inhibited due to the presence of reinforcements.Consequently,internal stress is produced and accumulated during the carbonization process.Kimura et al. measured the stress accumulation at the boundary between carbon fiber and carbon precursor as a function of the distance from the surface of carbon fiber using a model of a thick-wall cylinder,and the maximum stress accumulated at the carbon fiber-carbon precursor interface was calculated to have possibly reached $0 . 4 \mathrm { G P a }$ during carbonization.2° As mentioned above,the shrinkage of polyimide/graphene composite film (around $1 4 \%$ ） was much less than that of polyimide film (around $2 2 \%$ ）after heat treatment,which was because the tough and rigid graphene could partially suppress the shrinkage of polyimide during heat treatment.This led to the development of internal stress in the polyimide/graphene composite,which could be responsible for the acceleration in graphitization process of the polyimide in the polyimide/graphene composite film.

From reported studies about graphitization process of composites, themaximum internal stressaccumulated at the reinforcement-carbon precursor interface and the internal stress decreased as the distance from the reinforcement increased.16,20 Therefore,the graphitization of carbon precursors was found to start at the interface between the reinforcements and carbon precursors.If the distance between the reinforcements and the carbon precursors was large enough， no acceleration in the graphitization process of carbon precursors was found to take place.16 The nonuniformity was considered to be a characteristic of the internal stress-assisted graphitization.16 Carbon fiber was widelyused asa reinforcement,and Bahl adviced that the carbon fiber should be used in the chopped form to increase the stress centers.45 In the study, thermally exfoliated graphene with high specific surface area was dispersed uniformly in the polyimide matrix. This was done to help generate more stress centers.

# CONCLUSION

Different from most studies about internal stress-assisted graphitization where carbon fiber was used as the reinforcement,tough and rigid thermally exfoliated graphene with a high specific surface area was chosen as the reinforcement in the study. It was found that,after addition of graphene,the shrinkage of polyimide film in the direction parallel to the film surface during heat treatment was effectively suppressed. This phenomenon was an indication of formation of stress in the polyimide/graphene composite.As a result,a significant acceleration in the graphitization process of polyimide was found to take place.Based on the finding,we can conclude that graphene is a good choice as the reinforcement to accelerate graphitization process of carbon precursors.
