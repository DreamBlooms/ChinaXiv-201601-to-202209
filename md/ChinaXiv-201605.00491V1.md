# Summary

Rice is the most important staple food for more than half of the human population,and blast disease is the most serious disease affecting global rice production.In this work,the isoform OsCPK4 of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase family is reported as a regulator of rice immunity to blast fungal infection.It shows that overexpression of $\boldsymbol { O s C P K 4 }$ gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration.The constitutive accumulation of OsCPK4 protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response,including the production of reactive oxygen species,callose deposition and defence gene expression.OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield. Given that OsCPK4 Overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice,the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signaling pathways.Altogether,our findings indicate that OsCPK4 is a potential molecular target to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance,but also blast disease resistance of rice crops.

# Introduction

Rice blast disease,caused by the filamentous ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae,is the most important rice disease due to its severity and wide distribution (approximately 85 countries around theworld) (Ou,1987).Magnaporthe oryzaeattacks rice plantsat all developmental stages,more often during the seedling stage, and it can infect leaves,stems,nodes,collars and panicles (Dean et al.,2o12). Rice blast causes severe crop losses varying from 10 to $8 5 \%$ depending on the area and climatology (Skamnioti and Gurr,20o9)(http://www.irri.org/research/better-rice-varieties/disease-and-pest-resistnatn-rice).Resistant cultivars and pesticides have traditionally been used to control this disease.However, the fungus M.oryzae overcomes host resistance quickly，and resistant cultivars become ineffective aftera few years (Lee et al., 2009).Pesticide use,on the other hand,is costly and environmentally unfriendly.Being rice a paramount source of human food,new strategies providing long-term blast protection should therefore be developed.The study of the plant defence responses offersavast field of possibilitiesto improve disease resistance in rice.

In addition to structural barriers and preformed antimicrobial compounds,plants have evolved inducible immune responses to defend themselves against pathogen attack. The defence response starts with the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that activate the PAMP-triggered immunity (PTl) (Boller and He，2009； Chisholm et al.，2006; Jones and Dangl，2006). Successful pathogens have evolved to suppress the PTl response by the action of effectors.But plants in turn have evolved a second defence layer,known as effector-triggered immunity (ETl), consisting of resistance proteins that recognize these effectors (Jones and Dangl，2Oo6)．Both PTl and ETl counteract the pathogen attack by inducing immune responses (Tsuda and Katagiri,2O1O).The earliest defence reactions include changes in ionfluxes across membranes,an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration，the activation of protein kinases or the synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Baxter et al.，2013; Lecourieux et al.,2006;Meng and Zhang,2013;Seybold et al., 2014;Tena et al.,2011;Torres,201O).Forward reactions consist of transcriptional reprogramming,alterations in hormone status and cell wall reinforcement through callose depositions and lignifications and in some cases even by cell death at the site of infection (Liu et al.,2014;Luna etal.,2010;Navarro etal.,2004; Tsudaand Katagiri,201O). Defence responses locallyactivated in primary pathogen-infected plant tissues are often extended to distal noninfected tissues, conferring systemic acquired resistance (SAR) (Durrant and Dong，2004; Ryals et al.，1996)．This resistance is long-lasting and effective against secondary attack byunrelated pathogens.SAR is associated with the signal molecule salicylic acid (SA) and the accumulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that are thought to contribute to resistance (Durrant and Dong,2004).

Calcium influx is one of the earliest events upon pathogen recognition in plant defence response (Ranf et al.， 2011). Alterations in calcium concentration are sensed by calciumbinding proteins,including calmodulin,calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKor CPKs) and calcineurin B-like proteins,which relay the calcium signal into specific cellular and physiological responses (Dodd et al.,2010;Harper et al.，2004).CPKs represent unique calcium sensors able to translate calcium signals directly into phosphorylation events,because they combine in a single molecule a calcium-binding domain and a serine/threonine kinase domain (Harper et al.，2oo4).In this sense，genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that these plant proteins areimportant players in numerous signalling pathways and biological processes，including stress signalling cascades and immune signalling responses (Boudsocq and Sheen,2013;Romeis and Herde,2014; Schulz et al.,2013).

CPKs are encoded by large gene families,the rice genome containing $3 1 \subset P K$ genes(Asano et al.,2005;Ray et al.,2007). In contrast to Arabidopsis CPKs,little is known about the functions of specific rice CPKs.Among the ones functionally characterized are the OsCPK13 (Saijo et al.，2000)，OsCPK12 (Asano et al., 2012)and OsCPK9 (Wei etal.，2014) proteins that have been reported as signalling components of abiotic stress responses; the OsCPK10 (Fu et al.，2013)and the OsCPK18 (Xie et al.,2014) were describedas positive and negative regulators of M.oryzae resistance，respectively.Only OsCPK12 has been shown to be involved in both abiotic and biotic stress signalling (Asano et al., 2012)．Recently，our group reported that OsCPK4 positively regulates salt and drought stress adaptation (Campo et al., 2014)．Contrary to OsCPK12 that oppositely modulates the different signalling pathways，the present study reports that OsCPK4 is also a positive regulator of immunity in rice.OsCPK4 overexpression confersan enhanced resistance to blast disease in rice plants by preventing M.oryzae fungal penetration.The enhanced resistance phenotype is associated with the constitutive accumulation of conjugated SA and callose，and a fast and stronger activation of defence responses,including ROS production and defence gene expression，without compromising rice productivity.

# Results

# OsCPK4 expression is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice plants

A search for altered expression genes in a microarray-based global transcriptomic analysis of rice plantsin response to M.oryzae elicitors (Campo et al.，2013) identified the $\boldsymbol { O s C P K 4 }$ gene as an up-regulated gene in leaves after $2 - h$ treatment (fold change $= 1 . 9 4$ P-value $= 0 . 0 0 0 2 \mathrm { \cdot }$ .The $\tt O s C P K 4$ gene $( \mathsf { L O C } _ { - }$ $\mathsf { O s 0 2 g 0 3 4 1 0 } )$ encodes a CDPK involved in the adaptation of rice plants to salinity and drought conditions (Campo et al.,2014).To confirm that $\tt O s C P K 4$ gene expression is altered during the defence response of rice plants,it was examined in leaves at different times after inoculation with M.oryzae spores (Figure 1a).OsCPK4 expression was rapid and strongly induced in riceleavesat earlier stagesof infection at $6 \mathfrak { h }$ postinoculation (hpi)，coinciding with the formation of the fungal infective structure， named appressorium(Wilson and Talbot，2009). OsCPK4 activation increased until 12 hpi (approximatelyan eightfold increase) and started to decrease at 24 hpi,once fungal penetration had already occurred.These observations show that OsCPK4 isan early-response gene against M.oryzae infection in rice leaves.

OsCPK4 protein accumulation was also examined in blastinfected leaves.In agreement with OsCPK4 transcript levels, Western blot analyses showed an increase in the accumulation of the encoded protein after pathogen inoculation (Figure 1b). These results indicate that $\tt O s C P K 4$ transcriptional activation is translated in the protein accumulation and suggest that the OsCPK4 protein is involved in the defence response of rice plants to M.oryzae infection.

# OsCPK4 overexpressor rice plants are more resistant to Magnaportheoryzae infection

To further investigate the function of OsCPK4 in rice immunity, weused the transgenic OsCPK4-overexpressing rice plants previously described (Campo et al.，2014).These plants were produced in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare and expressed the $\tt O s C P K 4$ full-length cDNA under the control of the strong and constitutive ZmUbi1 promoter.Quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the expression of OsCPK4 was indeed significantly enhanced in the leaves of $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 – O x }$ plants in comparison with wild-type or control empty vector plants (Figure S1a),resulting also in an increased accumulation of the corresponding protein (Figure S1b).The activity of the accumulated protein is dependent on the presence of calcium (Figure S1c)，suggesting that it remains as a latent protein in the rice leaves prone to be stimulated by calcium changes.

The phenotype of $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 – O x }$ lines,compared to wild-type or empty vector plants,was then characterized when challenged with the blast fungus using a detached leaf assay (Coca et al., 2004).Following inoculation with the M. oryzae virulent strain FR13， the OsCPK4-Ox leaves developed less severe disease symptoms than control leaves (Figure 2a).At 7 dpi,extensive necrotic lesions with fungal sporulation were macroscopically observed on wild-type and empty vector leaves,whereas only few lesions were developed on the OsCPK4-Ox leaves.The percentage of leaf area affected by blast lesions was determined by image analyses.The results revealed a statistically significant reduction onthe lesion area of three independent transgenic lines as compared to control leaves (Figure 2b).In agreement with visual inspection,OsCPK4-Ox leaves contained a significant less fungal biomass than control leaves,as determined by ${ \mathsf { q P C R } }$ analysis of M.oryzae DNA (Figure 2c).The enhanced resistance phenotype to the blast fungus exhibited by OsCPK4-Ox leaves was then confirmed by whole-plant infection assays.In this case,rice plants were spray-inoculated witha M.oryzae spore suspension,under experimental conditions similar to field conditions.The wild-type and empty vector control plants developed the typical blast disease lesions,whereas the $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 – O x }$ plants showed clearly less and smaller infection lesions (Figure 2d).Further measure of disease severity showed that a higher percentage of $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 - O x }$ plants exhibited resistant phenotype (around $2 2 \%$ ）thanwildtype or empty vector plants (around $5 { - } 1 0 \%$ ，andalower percentage exhibited highly susceptible phenotype (around $2 7 \%$ ） than control plants $( 6 5 \% )$ (Figure 2e). Collectively, these results suggest that $\arccos \ C P K 4$ positively mediates an enhanced resistance to blast fungal infection.

To gain more insight into the nature of the enhanced blast resistance observed in the OsCPK4-Ox plants，the infection process and fungal development in rice leaves was investigated by fluorescencemicroscopyanalysisusingaGFP-expressing M.oryzae virulent strain (GFP-Guy11).GFP expression is reported not to affect the pathogenicity of M.oryzae fungal strains (Campos-Soriano and San Segundo,2oo9;Sesma and Osbourn, 2004).At early infection stages (12 hpi),M. oryzae spores were easilyvisualized on the leaf surface of the rice plants by fluorescence confocal microscopy (Figure 3a-d).Most of the spores on wild-type and empty vector leaves were germinated and produced short germ tubes that developed appressoria and invasive hyphae penetrating into epidermal cells (Figure 3a-b,e). However，M.oryzae spores on OsCPK4-Ox leaves germinated freely developing abnormal germ tubes-in some cases thick and highly vacuolated (Figure 3c),while,in others,thin and very long (Figure 3d)，without visible evidences of penetration events (Figure $3 \mathsf { f } _ { - 9 } ,$ .These observations support that fungal penetration was impaired in $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 – O x }$ leaves.After2 dpi,infection lesions werevisible under fluorescent microscopy in control leaves (Figure 3h)，but not in OsCPK4-Ox leaves (Figure 3i)．At later stages (7dpi),M. oryzae completed its life cycle in wild-type and empty vector leaves showing the typicalblast lesionswitha bright fluorescent mycelia growing and sporulating (Figure 3j-k).Only small necrotic spots were observed in the OsCPK4-Ox leaves (Figure 3l-m).Our observations indicate that OsCPK4-mediated resistance relies in the interference with fungal penetration rather than colonization.

The resistance of OsCPK4-Ox plants to other rice pathogens Was also evaluated. Seedlings were assayed against the seedborne and soil-transmitted fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides,which has been associated with the bakanae disease in rice (Wulff et al.，201O).Our results indicate that OsCPK4-Ox seedlingsareas susceptible to F.verticillioides infection as control wild-type and empty vector plants (Figure S2). Similarly, OsCPK4- Ox seedlings were equally susceptible as control seedlings when challenged with the bacterial pathogen Dickeya dadantii,previouslyknownas Erwinia chrysanthemi,the causal agent of foot rot in rice (Goto,1979; Mansfield et al.,2012).These results suggest that the enhanced resistance to M. oryzae shown by OsCPK4-Ox plants is specific against this fungal pathogen and that it does not affect their defence against other rice pathogens with different pathogenesis mechanisms.

# Defence response is early activated in OsCPK4 overexpressor rice plants

One of the earliest defence reactions is the production of ROS,a hallmark of successful pathogen recognition and activation of plant defence response (Torres，201O).Because OsCPK4 interfereswith the M.oryzae infection process at early stages，the ROS production during defence responses in $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 - O x }$ rice leaves was investigated.ROS formation was monitored in vivo usingthe C $M - H _ { 2 } D C F D A$ probe,a noninvasive fluorescent ROS indicator (Kristiansen et al.，2oo9).Microscopicanalyses showed the induction of fluorescence in rice leaves in response to elicitor treatment,which was faster and stronger in the OsCPK4 than in wild-type or control empty vector leaves (Figure 4a).Thirty minutes after elicitor treatment,fluorescence was barely visualized in the wild-type or empty vector leaves,but clearly visible in the leaves of two independent OsCPK4-Ox lines (Figure 4a, middle panels).At 1-hour treatment，the ROS formation was already detected in the wild-type and empty vector leaves, although a stronger fluorescent labelling was observed in the OsCPK4 lines (Figure 4a, lower panels).Fluorescence quantification showed significant differences in intensity and timing of ROS formation between OsCPK4-Ox and control lines (Figure 4b). Similarly，ROSproductionwas significantly stronger inthe OsCPK4-Ox leaves compared to control leaves in response to M.oryzae spore inoculation (Figure 4c-d).These observations suggest that OsCPK4 accumulation mediates accelerated and potentiated ROs formation in response to M.oryzae infection in rice leaves.

Another defence hallmark is the callose deposition to fortify cell walls that avoids pathogen penetration into the plant cell (Luna et al.,2010; Voigt, 2014). Given that $\arccos \ C P K 4$ overexpression prevents fungal penetration,the callose accumulation was analysed in OsCPK4-Ox leaves.Callose was clearly visualized after aniline blue staining as intense blue-green fluorescence under UV light in the epidermal cell walls of $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 – O x }$ leaves (Figure 5). Quantification of fluorescent leaf area indicated that callosewas more abundantly accumulated in the cell walls of $\_ O s C P K 4 - \_ O x$ leaves inoculated with M.oryzae spores (24 hpi) than in noninoculated leaves (Figure 5b).Under the same experimental conditions,callose fluorescence was not detected in control plant leaves.These observations indicate that $\tt O s C P K 4$ overexpression mediates the constitutive accumulation of callose， and its stronger deposition in response to pathogen infection in rice leaves.

# Defence gene expression is potentiated in OsCPK4 overexpressor rice plants

Tofurther investigate the mechanism underlying OsCPK4- mediated disease resistance, the expression profile of rice defence genes was analysed in the transgenic plants in response to M.oryzae infection．First，the expression of the widely used defence marker OsPBZ1 and $\scriptscriptstyle { O s P R 5 }$ genes was monitored.These genes encode two SA-regulated pathogenesis-related proteins from the PR10 and PR5 families (Datta et al.，1999;Jwa et al., 2006;Midoh and lwata，1996；Rakwal et al.，2001). Stronger induction of these two defence genes was observed in OsCPK4- $\mathsf { O x }$ plants when compared to wild-type or empty vector control plants upon pathogen challenge (Figure 6a-b).These observations suggest that the OsCPK4-Ox plants developed a potentiated defence compared to control plants.

Similarly， the analysis of defence signalling components OsNPR1/OsNH1 and OsWRKY45 genes showed a stronger induction in the OsCPK4-Ox plants than in the control plants (Figure 6c-d).The two genes encode a transcriptional cofactor and transcriptional factor of the SA-mediated defence pathway (Chern et al.， 2001； Shimono et al.， 2012)． Additionally， upstream components,such as the OsEDS1 gene encoding an activator of SA signalling (Wiermer et al.，20o5),or the OsSID2 gene encoding the isochorismate synthase enzyme responsible for part of SA synthesis in plants (Wildermuth et al.,2oo1),also showed stronger activation in $\scriptstyle O s C P K 4 - O x$ plants (Figure 6e-f). These results show stronger activation of the SA signalling defence pathway in OsCPK4-Ox plants that might mediate its enhanced resistance to M. oryzae.

# Overexpression of OsCPK4 leads to an increased SA content without compromising rice productivity

The observed strong induction of OsSiD2 gene expression,as well as of other genes related to SA defence signalling,prompted us to quantify the SA content in the OsCPK4-Ox lines.We determined the levels of free SA and its glucose conjugate (SAG)under control conditions.No significant differences in free SA levels were detected,but OsCPK4-Ox leaves accumulated up to twice as much SAG as compared to the control empty vector or wild-type leaves (Figure 7).Our results indicate that the overexpression of OsCPK4 leads to the accumulation of SAG in rice leaves under control conditions,which in turn results in the strong activation of downstream SA-mediated defence upon pathogen infection,as revealed by our gene expression studies.

The constitutive accumulation of SA is often associated with disease resistance but is also accompanied by fitness costs, that is a penalty in plant growth and productivity (Takatsuji,2014).To determine the effects of detected high SAG levels in OsCPK4 rice plants，several fitness parameters of plant growth under controlled conditions were analysed. $\_ O s C P K 4 - \_ O x$ plants showed a similar appearance than control wild-type and empty vector plants (Figure S3a).They reached the same height at heading time (Figure S3b)，flowered at the same period of time after sowing (Figure S3c) and，more importantly，produced a similar grainyield in two different experiments in which plants were grown under random distribution (Figure S3d). Hence,despite the OsCPK4-mediated SAG accumulation,our observations indicate that OsCPK4 overexpression does not have a negative impact in the growth and productivity of rice plants.

# Discussion

The present study reveals that the isoform OsCPK4 from the multigenic family of rice CDPKs has a function in the innate immunity of rice plants.Given that $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 }$ was also known to participate in the salt and drought stress responses (Campo et al., 2014)，our results demonstrate that OsCPK4 is a signalling component that positively modulates both abiotic and biotic stress responses in rice plants.This work shows that the expression of the $\arccos \ C P K 4$ gene was rapidly induced in rice leaves when challenged with the M. oryzae pathogen and that $\boldsymbol { O s C P K 4 }$ overexpression conferred enhanced resistance to rice blast disease,together supporting that OsCPK4 mediates the immune response to blast fungus in rice plants.OsCPK4 accumulation is induced at early stages of the infection process,coinciding with pathogen penetration and suggesting that this protein acts at the earliest signalling events initiated upon pathogen recognition. Among the earliest immune reactions,calcium influxesare included (Blume et al.,2ooO;Jeworutzki et al.,2010;Ranf et al., 2011),which occur through plasma membrane calcium channels activated by the recognition via pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) ofpathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Kurusu et al.,20o5). Because OsCPK4 is localized at the plant plasma membrane (Campo et al.，2014)，our hypothesized mechanistic model is that OsCPK4 acts as calcium sensor of changes stimulated by pathogen perception that triggers the downstream defence signalling events mediated by phosphorylation cascades (Figure 8). In agreement with the proposed mechanism of action,OsCPK4-Ox plants that accumulate constitutively increased levels of the protein exhibited a rapid and potentiated defence response upon pathogen infection.These plants accumulate the full OsCPK4 protein,including the calciumbinding regulatory domain，ready to be stimulated by calcium upon pathogen sensing.Thus，OsCPK4-Ox plants showed fast and enhanced ROS production,increased callose deposition and strong defence gene expression when challenged with the M.oryzae fungal pathogen.As a result, these plants showed an enhanced disease resistance phenotype against M.oryzae as determined by visual inspection,fungal growth quantification and disease lesion measurement. Blast disease resistance was shown not only in detached leaf assays but also in whole-plant infection assays.These results support that OsCPK4 participates in the signal transmission initiated by pathogen perception，and the constitutive increased accumulation of OsCPK4 leads to an accelerated and amplified defence signal.

Our results showed that ROS production was stronger and faster in $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 - O x }$ plants upon elicitor or pathogen perception. ROS levels might reach toxic thresholds for M. oryzae, leading to fungal penetration blockage as observed under confocal microscopy.However,the importance of ROS in defence reactions is not only due to their toxicity to pathogens,but also to their role as signalling molecules for local and systemic responses (Mittler et al.，2011).ROS mediate the defensive response through oxidative waves that activate signal transduction through phosphorylation cascades,accompanied by hormonal signalling and the expression of defence-related genes (Baxter et al.，2013; Shetty et al.，20o8).Therefore,the increased ROS production might contribute to the enhanced defence responsiveness observed in $\_ O s C P K 4 – O x$ plants.Be as toxic compound or as signalling molecules,ROS production seems to contribute to the enhanced resistance of OsCPK4-Ox plants,and to be activated by OsCPK4 in response to PAMP stimulation.Connections between ROS production and CPKs have been already described in the literature; these studies report that ectopic expression of constitutivelyactive CPKvariants resulted in an increased production of ROS (Dubiella et al.,2013;Kobayashi et al.,2007;Romeis et al., 2001；Xing et al.，2001).Moreover，NADPH oxidases playing a central role in the oxidative burst during immune responses have been reported as CPK targets in potato and Arabidopsis (Dubiella et al.,2013;Kobayashi et al.,2007). Similarly for rice, the plasma membrane NADPH oxidases might be potential targets of the plasma membrane-associated OsCPK4 protein,triggering a fast and strong oxidative burst upon pathogen attack in the plants that constitutively accumulated increased levels of OsCPK4 protein. Other sources for ROS production also exist in plant cells,such as the peroxidases identified in Arabidopsis as major contributors to ROS production during responses to fungal elicitors (Daudi et al., 2012),and they might be also potential OsCPK4 targets.Future studies will address OsCPK4 target identification.

Figure 8 Model for OsCPK4-mediated defence responses.Stress induces ${ \mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ increase that activates OsCPK4 leading to ROS production,callose deposition and SA-regulated defence gene expression resulting in resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae infection. $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 }$ also mediated the accumulation of SAG.

OsCPK4 overexpressor plants accumulate increased SAG levels, the glycosylated form of SA.SAG is considered a likely storage form of physiologically active free SA,which isaccumulated in the vacuole to serve as a source of free SA when required in dicotyledonous plants (Dean et al.,2005; Seo et al.,1995). In rice plants, SAG has been proposed to have per se a role in activating defences for induced resistance (Umemura et al.，2oo9).This increased accumulation of SAG prepared OsCPK4-overexpressing rice plants for a strong activation of SA-mediated defence signalling upon M. oryzae infection.As a result,intense activation of components of the SA pathway was detected,including the biosynthetic gene OsSID2,the OsNH1 and OsWRKY45 transcriptional activator genes and the end products OsPBZ1 and $\scriptscriptstyle { O s P R 5 }$ Another immune response associated with SA is the callose deposition,being promoted by SA (Yi et al.,2014).Inagreement with the high SAG content,callose was also accumulated in the OsCPK4-Ox. Callose might represent a physical barrier that prevents fungal penetration leading to the observed resistant phenotype of $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 – O x }$ plants.Our results reveal that $\mathsf { O s C P K 4 }$ contributes to the accumulation of SAG and callose in rice plants under noninductive conditions.

Our data suggest that the rice plants overexpressing OsCPK4 are sensitized or preconditioned for a robust and fast immune response by accumulatinga signalling component that can be immediately activatedupon exposuretostress.Defence responses usually have fitness costs associated with resource allocation for defensive compounds or the toxicity of the defensive products (van Hulten et al.,2oo6),and the strategies to improve disease resistance in plants based on the constitutive activation of defences are accompanied by negative effectson plant growth and yield (Gust et al.,2010; Takatsuji,2014). In this sense，we have shown that the overexpression of the $\ O s C P K 4$ gene in rice plants does not have a negative impact on plant performance,at least under containment conditions.The growth, flowering time and yield fitness parameters of these plants are not significantly different than those of the wild-type plants.This is in agreement with the observation that OsCPK4-overexpressing rice plants did not show the constitutive expression of defencerelated genes or ROS accumulation under noninductive conditions，although they do accumulate SAG and callose.Thisis consistent with the already reported global transcriptomic analyses showing that overexpression of OsCPK4 in rice plants has a low impact in the rice transcriptome (Campo et al.，2014). Altogether，our results support that OsCPK4 might be a good target for blast protection while maintaining rice yield.

$\mathsf { O s C P K 4 – O x }$ rice plants are also more tolerant to salt and drought stress (Campo et al.,2014).SA,in addition to modulate the immune response in plants,is also known to improve the tolerance to salt and drought stress by preventing membrane damageamong othermechanisms(Farooq et al.， 2009; Jayakannan et al.，2013).Moreover，SA inhibits lipid peroxidation,thus protecting cell membranes (Dinis et al.,1994; Lapenna et al.,2oo9).Therefore, the improved tolerance to drought and salinity of OsCPK4-Ox rice plants associated with a reduction in lipid peroxidation could be mediated by the increased content of SAG.This is an interesting result because trade-offs between defence and abiotic stress tolerance have been frequently reported (Sharma et al.,2013).For instance,OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt stress tolerance and blast disease resistance (Asano et al.，2012).However，crosstalk between biotic and abiotic signalling pathways can result not only in negative but also in positive functional outcomes (Sharma et al.,2013). Our studies demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways, presumably modulating SA levelsand suggesting that it is a good molecular target to improve tolerance to different stresses in rice plants.

# Experimental procedures

# Plant and fungal growth conditions

$\tt O s C P K 4$ overexpressor rice plants were previously generated and described (Campo et al.,2014).They were grown at $2 8 ^ { \circ } C$ with a $1 4 - 1 > 1 0 - h$ light/dark photoperiod. Fungal strains of M.oryzae FR13isolate (provided byD.Tharreau,CIRADMontpelier,France) and Guy11-GFP (provided by A.Sesma，CBGP Madrid，Spain) were grown in oatmeal agar (72.5 g/L, $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ chloramphenicol) for 2 weeks at $2 8 ^ { \circ } C$ using a 16-h/8-h light/dark photoperiod. Theirspores were collected in sterile water，filtrated with Miracloth (Calbiochem) and adjusted to the appropriate concentration usinga Bürker counting chamber.M.oryzae elicitors were obtained as previously described (Casacuberta et al.，1992). F.verticillioides and D.dadantii strains were grown as previously described (Gomez-Ariza et al.,2007).

# RNA isolation and RT-qPCR

Gene expression levels were determined from a pool of four leaves at the same developmental stage of 3-week-old soil-grown plants.Total RNA was extracted using TRlzol reagent (Invitrogen, Basel，Switzerland).DNase-treated RNA $( 1 ~ \mu 9 )$ was retrotranscribed using the transcriptor first cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, Mannheim,Germany).qRT-PCR analyses were carried out in 96- well optical plates in a LightCycler@ 480 System (Roche) according to the following programme: 10 min at $9 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ,45 cycles of $9 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for 10 s and $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for 30 s and an additional cycle of dissociation curves to ensure a unique amplification.The reaction mixture contained $5 ~ { \mu \ L }$ of SYBR Green Master mix reagent (Roche), $2 ~ \mu \iota$ of 1:4 diluted cDNA sample and 3o0 nM of each gene-specific primer (Table S1) in a final volume of $1 0 ~ \mu \iota$ The results for the gene expression were normalized to OsUbi1 (LOC_Os06g46770) andOsUbi5 (LOC_Os01g22490) genes as indicated.Three technical replicateswere performed for each sample.

# Protein extracts, CPK activity and immunoblot analysis

Protein extracts were obtained from membrane-enriched fractions prepared from leaves in a pool of at least four plants. Samples were ground in liquid nitrogen, thawed in two volumes ofextractionbuffer( $10 \%$ sucrose, $5 0 \mathrm { \ m w \ T r i s \mathrm { \_ H C l \ p H 7 . 5 , 5 \ m w } }$ EDTA， $5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ EGTA， $5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ dithiothreitol, $1 \ m _ { \mathsf { M } }$ PMSF)and centrifuged at $1 5 \ 0 0 0 \ { \mathrm { g } }$ for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ .The pelletwas resuspended in 2 volumes of elution buffer ( $1 \%$ Triton $x - 1 0 0$ $2 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ Tris-HCl pH 7.5, $1 \mathrm { \ m u } \mathrm { M g } { \mathsf { C l } } _ { 2 } ,$ 1 mM PMSF) using a cooled sonication bath. Protein extracts were recovered from the supernatant after centrifugationas before,quantified,separated inSDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses were performed using anti-OsCPK4 antibodies as described (Campo et al.，2014).Two independent experiments with 3 biological repeats on a pool of 3 independent plants for each time point were analysed.Antibodies were raised against the N-terminal variable domain of OsCPK4 (Met1 to Arg58） to specifically recognize this isoform of the conserved OsCPK family protein.

Thecalcium-dependent kinase activity was analysed as described with minor modifications (Boudsocq et al.，2012). These include that total protein was extracted from rice leaves andimmunoprecipitated for $2 h$ with specific anti-OsCPK4 antibodies bound to Dynabeads? with the antibody coupling kit (Life Technologies,Carlsbad, CA,USA),that the phosphorylation substrates were $\beta$ -casein peptide (Sigma St. Louis,MO,USA) and myelin basic protein (Invitrogen）and that the unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were discarded using MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare Little Chalfont, UK).The concentration of free calcium in each buffer was calculated using MaxChelator (http://maxchelator.stanford.edu/).

# Disease resistance assays with rice pathogens

Moryzae infections were performed using a detached leaf infection assay as described (Coca et al.，2oo4)，or a wholeplant infection assay by spraying the fungal spores with an aerograph at 2 atmospheres of pressure.Infection assays were carried out with 3-week-old plants grown in soil，using three potswith 10 plants each per lineand $2 m L$ ofspore suspension ( ${ 1 0 } ^ { 5 }$ spores/mL） per pot.The plants were maintained for $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ inaclosed plastic bag for high humidity conditions after inoculation.Lesion areas were measured by image analysis software Assess v.2.0 at 7 days postinoculation (dpi).Fungal biomass in rice infected leaveswas determined at 7 dpi by qPCR using specific primers for the 26S ribosomal RNA gene of M.oryzae and normalized to OsUbi1 gene as described (Qi and Yang，2002).DNA (15 ng per qPCR)was obtained from the rice infected leaves as described (Murrayand Thompson 198O),but using MATAB as extraction buffer $( 0 . 1 ~ \mathsf { M }$ Tris-HCI,pH 8.0, $1 . 4 ~ \mathsf { M }$ NaCl, $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ EDTA, $2 \%$ MATAB, $1 \%$ PEG 6000 and $0 . 5 \%$ sodium sulphite).Disease symptoms on whole-plant infection assays were scored at 7 dpi following the Standard Evaluation System for blast rice disease (IRRl，2002). Three biological replicates were performed for each line and three technical replicates per sample.

Infection assays with F.verticillioides were performedas previously described with minor modifications (Bundó et al., 2014)，including a seed germination period of $8 \ h$ previous inoculation with $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ spores/mL suspensions.

Assays with $D$ .dadantii were carried out as described with minor modifications (Gomez-Ariza et al.，2oo7)，reducing the seed germination period to $8 \ h$ andincreasing the inoculation doses to ${ 1 0 } ^ { 7 }$ CFU.

# Fluorescence microscopy

Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed usingan Olympus FV100O microscope (Tokyo，Japan).GFP was excited with an argon ion laser emitting at $4 8 8 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ and fluorescence detected at 500-550 nm.Chlorophyll autofluorescence was visualized at 6oo-7oo nm.Lesions were also observed under a Zoom Stereo Microscope Olympus SZX16 fitted with an Olympus DP72 digital camera.

For ROS detection, leaf segments from at least three different plants were infiltrated with a $1 0 ~ \mu \mu$ solution of the fluorescent probe CM- ${ \cdot } { \mathsf { H } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { D } } C { \mathsf { F } } { \mathsf { D } } { \mathsf { A } }$ (Molecular Probes） in $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ phosphate buffer $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 7 . 2$ for $2 h$ .The leaves were then treated with a $1 \%$ M.oryzae elicitor solution in sterile Water or inoculated with a ${ 1 0 } ^ { 5 }$ spores/mL suspension. ROS was monitored over the time using an Axiophot Zeiss epifluorescent microscope,and fluores cent signals were quantified by image analysis using the ImageJ software.

Callose accumulation was visualized by fluorescence under epifluorescence microscopy after aniline blue staining of leaf segments from at least three different plants as previously described (Luna etal.，201O).The fluorescent area per leaf segment was quantified also using the ImageJ software.

# Salicylic acid quantification

Free SA and SA $\beta$ -glucoside (SAG) content in rice leaves was determined as previously described with some minor modifications (Coca and San Segundo,201O).Total SA was obtained from 1 gof fresh grinded leaves by two consecutive methanol and ethanol extractions( $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ each).After alcohol evaporation，the extracts were resuspended in waterand separated into two parts, one to determine free SA and the other for SAG.SAG samples were digested with $1 0 \ \mathrm { U / m L }$ of $\beta$ -glucosidase from almonds (Sigma) at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ during $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .After digestion,the sampleswere filled up to 1 mL with milli-Q water,and HCl $3 7 \%$ 1 $( 5 0 ~ \mu \ L )$ was added.They were subjected to two consecutive extractions with ethyl acetate/cyclopentane/isopropanol $( 2 \mathrm { \ m L } , 5 0 { : } 5 0 { : } 1 )$ .Organic phases were evaporated and resuspended in methanol $( 2 5 ~ \mu \ L )$ for the HPLC analysis using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (Agilent Technologies，Santa Clara，CA，USA).Two biological replicates were performed for each independent line.
