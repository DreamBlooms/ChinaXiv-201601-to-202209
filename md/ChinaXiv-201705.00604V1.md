# 1.Introduction

Corrosion is one of the persistent problems for marine infrastructures,which occurs due to chemical or electrochemical reactions between the marine environment and metals.Presence of microorganism in the corrosive media makes the corrosion more complicated.Formost metallic materials for instance stainless steel

316L[1] used in the marine environment, their mechanical,physical and chemical properties can be damaged by the activity of the microorganisms that attach on the surfaces of the metallic structures.Colonization of microorganisms on metallic surface is capable of changing the electrochemical reaction at biofilm/metal interface,in turn either inhibiting or accelerating the corrosion [2,3].Use of thermal spray technique has been successful for effectively protecting the marine structures from corrosion through providing inorganic coatings for maintenance-free long-term services [4-8]. Thermal spray process offers the advantages of costefficiency,wide selection of coating materials,and easy on-site operation,making it one of the most promising surface coating techniques. Due to the intrinsic feature of the technique, the coatings usually exhibit high levels of interlamellar cracksand micropores,which could be detrimental to corrosion resistance [9]. Development of biofilm on the surfaces of the coatings would certainly influence their anti-corrosion properties. In-depth knowledge has been gained pertaining to the biocorrosion of metallicalloys.However,unfortunately, thereare so far few reports available elucidating the biocorrosion behavior of thermal sprayed marine coatings. Related knowledge is still lacking.

Surface properties of the marine structures certainly affect the bacteria attachment.Some materials enhance the formation of bacteria biofilm while some inhibit bacterial growth.It was reported that under identical environmental conditions,Bacillus mycoides accelerated corrosion of zinc，inhibited corrosion of aluminum,and showed no effect on the corrosion of mild steel [10]. Surface roughness,polarization，oxide coverage，and chemical composition have remarkable impact on bacterial attachment and biofilm formation [11].Eashwar et al.[12] proposed that the ennoblement of stainless steels in seawater was caused by the inhibitors produced by bacteria retained in biofilm matrix.Further evidence that bacteria maybe beneficial hasbeen reported [13,14]. It was found that the protective biofilms decreased the corrosion rate of steels by reducing oxygen concentration at the metal surfaces [15-19]. The positive effect attained by biofilms on anticorrosion performances have also been realized for other metals such as brass and copper [2o,21].However,in many cases the same bacteria with inhibitory property may also become aggressive [22], which leads to the well-known biocorrosion. The corrosion rate is completely different depending on the presence/absence of the biofilm.Yet precise evaluation and discrimination between usual corrosionand microbially influenced corrosion has been very hard, since the involvement of microorganisms would be always very delicate and difficult to be fixed [23-26].

Among the thermal sprayed marine coatings,aluminum coatings have proven to perform well in the marine environment. However,in many cases,use of aluminum coatings is limited since marine corrosion always accompanies wear.In recent years, nanostructured coatings have attracted significant attention due to their promise of significantly optimized or enhanced properties. It is generally believed that,because of their ultrafine structures, the coatings with nanostructures possess novel properties compared to traditional materials and have opened up opportunities for new technological applications [27-29].The inhibited corrosion by biofilm is usually believed to be predominately attributed to removal of corrosion agents,formation of a protective layer,elimination of corrosion-causing bacteria by antimicrobial agent,productionofpeptide corrosion inhibitor,orproductionof biosurfactant. Whereas formation of oxygen concentration cell, generation of corrosive substances,alternation of electrolyte ion concentration,and bacteria-induced inactivation of corrosion inhibitorare the likely mechanisms of accelerated corrosion by microorganisms [22]. Influence of the biofilm formed on the surfaces of thermal sprayed inorganic coatings on their corrosion behavior yet keeps elusive.In this study, the corrosion behavior of thermal sprayed Al and $\mathsf { A l / n a n o - A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ coatings with a biofilm formed on their surfaces in artificial seawater were examined.The biofilm constructed mainly by Escherichia coli（E.coli）bacteria was employed as the simplified model for the investigation.The biocorrosion mechanism of the coatings was further elucidated by microstructure characterization and modeling the liquid/metal interfaces.

# 2.Materials and methods

# 2.1. Fabrication of the coatings

Stainlesssteel316Lplateswiththedimensionof $2 0 \times 2 0 \times 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ were used as the substrates.The steel was comp0sed of 0.029wt.% C, 0.075wt.% N, 0.71wt $\%$ Si, 0.035wt.% P, 2.04wt $\%$ Mo,0.02wt.%S,15.92wt.% Cr,1.41wt $\%$ Mn,11.35wt.% Ni and remaining iron.Prior to the spraying,the substrates were degreased ultrasonically inacetone followed by grit blastingusing 60 mesh black fused alumina sand.Commercially available Al powderwith the size range of $5 0 { - } 1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ wasused as the starting feedstock.For the composite coating deposition,the starting $\mathsf { A l } /$ nano- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ powder was prepared by ball milling of the Al powder and $3 0 \ \mathrm { n m } \ A \mathrm { l } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ powder (Jingrui New Material Co.,Ltd,China) for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ .The ball to powder weight ratio was 1O:1.For each milling pot, $1 0 { \mathrm { g } }$ of the powder with an $\mathsf { A l / n a n o - A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ weight ratio of 9:1 was pre-mixed mechanically. The coatings were deposited using both high velocity arc spray(AS,TLAS-5ooC,China) and plasma spray(APS-2oooK,China).For the arc spraying,the current and voltage of the arc were 1oo A and $2 5 \mathrm { V }$ respectively,and the spray distance was $1 5 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，The compressed air with the pressure of $0 . 5 \mathrm { M P a }$ was used as auxiliary gas.The plasma spraying was conducted with the net energy of 25 kWand spray distance of $1 2 0 \mathrm { m m }$ .The feed rate of the powder was $2 0 \mathrm { g / m i n }$ carried by argon gas with the flow rate of $4 ~ \mathrm { l / m i n }$ .The flow rate of the primary gas argon and the secondary gas hydrogen was 42l/min and $1 2 ~ \mathrm { l / m i n }$ respectively.The thickness of the coatings was ${ \sim } 2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$

# 2.2.Characterization and corrosion testing of the coatings

Microstructure of the powder and the coatings was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM,FEI Quanta FEG25O,the Netherlands).After exposed fordifferent immersion time,2,7,and 3O days,in sterile and inoculated medium containing E.coli,the sampleswere examined by SEM to get their surface characteristics and corrosion features.To immobilize the bacterial cells,the samples were immersed for $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ in $2 . 5 \%$ glutaraldehyde solution.Then the samples were dehydrated by using four ethanol solutions of $2 5 \%$ $50 \%$ $7 5 \%$ and $100 \%$ successively for $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ each.Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX） detection was also performed to analyze the chemical compositions at local surface regions of the samples.For the corrosion testing of the coatings,potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) spectra were acquired using a Solartron Modulab system (21ooA,UK).All the testing was conducted at room temperature in artificial seawater(AsW) prepared according to the ASTM D1141-98 (2003).Peptone with the concentration of $3 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { l }$ was added to the mediaas carbon and energy sources for the bacteria. The medium was adjusted to the pH value of 7 and autoclaved at $1 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ .Before the electrochemical measurement, the coating samples were immersed in ASW contained in an aerobic chamberunder sterile conditions and in the presence of bacteria. The samples were then incubated at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ in a shaker at $1 2 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ at different exposure duration to a maximum of 3O days.Each set of the experiments was repeated three times to ensure reproducibility.A traditional three-electrode cell was used,with $1 \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ platinum as the counter electrode,a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)as the reference electrode and the specimen with an exposed area of $1 \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ as the working electrode.The surfaces were also sterilized with UVilluminationand $70 \%$ ethanol for $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ EIS measurement was performed with anapplied AC signal of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ and the frequency ranging from $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k H z }$ to $0 . 0 1 ~ \mathrm { H z }$ After the measurement, the acquired data were fitted and analyzed using a ZSimpWin software based on equivalent circuit models.The equivalent circuits were chosen based on the number of time constants and the quality of the fits [3o,31].Potentiodynamic polarization curves were acquired with thepotential range of $- 5 0 0 \mathrm { m V }$ to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m V } }$ [32] versus $E _ { o c p }$ at a scan rate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { m V s } ^ { - 1 }$

# 2.3.Preparationofbacterial strainsandcharacterizationofbiofilm

Gram-negative E.coli bacteria(ATCCNo.25922）were selected formaking the simplified biofilm model.The E. coli biofilm is typically composed of a thick exopolysaccharide layer，with a structure resembling that of Pseudomonas biofilms [33,34].The bacteria were grown in LB media.The medium was prepared by dissolving $1 0 \mathrm { g } \mathsf { N a C l }$ $_ { 5 \mathrm { g } }$ yeast extract and $1 0 { \mathrm { g } }$ peptone in $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ deionized water.The media containing the bacterial strains were shaken at $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ Cell number was determined based on the standard calibration with the assumption that an ${ \mathrm { O D } } _ { 6 0 0 { \mathrm { n m } } }$ value of 1.O is equivalent to $1 0 ^ { 9 } \mathrm { \ c e l l s / m l }$ The inoculated medium was prepared byadding E.coli for an initial concentration of $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { \ c e l l s / m l }$ at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under aerobic conditions.The biofilm formed on the surfaces of the coatings was characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy(FTIR,Nicolet 67oo,Thermo Fisher Scientific,USA) with the resolution of $4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and a scan range of $4 0 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$

# 3.Results and discussion

Topographical morphology of the ball-milled powder is shown in Fig.1. The Al/nano ${ \cdot \mathord { \mathsf { A l } } _ { 2 } } { 0 } _ { 3 }$ particles exhibit irregular shapes with the size of ${ \sim } 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (Fig.1a). It isclear that after the ball-milling, the nano- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ particles are attaching on the outmost shell of the Al particles (Fig.1b).Phase analysis by X-ray diffraction evidenced non changes in structure of both the Al and the ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ after the ballmilling processing (data not shown).Dense coatings were fabricated by the arc/plasma spray,as suggested by their cross-sectional morphologies (Fig.1c,d).Unique distribution of the nano ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ particles is clearly seen from the cross-sectional view of the composite coating(Fig.1d). This is not surprising since formation of thermal sprayed coating is accumulating process of individual particles.For the starting ball-milled $\mathsf { A l / n a n o - A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ powder,the nano alumina particles existon the surfaces ofAl particles.After the coating deposition,the nano particles should be predominately distributed at the interfaces between individual Al splats.The presence of the nano ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ particlesat Al splats'interfaces should affect the properties that are related to interfacial characteristics of interconnected splats.

It is noted that after 7 days exposure in the inoculated solution, the coatings incubated in the bacteria-free ASW show non changes on their surfaces (Fig.2 a-1,b-1).While for the coatings immersed fortwo days in the bacteria-containing ASW,the colonization of E. coli bacteria on the coatings are clearly seen (Fig.2 a-2,b-2). It is noted that the bacterial adhesion initially occurred near the microsized pores and cracks on the surfaces of the coatings.Subsequent accumulation and further growth of the bacteria was resulted predominately surrounding these areas.Secreted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)are typically seen in the periplasmic space of the bacteria (Fig.2 b-3),which usuallyactsasa binding material for the adhesion of bacterial cells to biofilm matrix [35].The appearance of EPS was also evidenced by EDX analysis in this work (Fig.3).Generally a thin film with the thickness of ${ \sim } 2 0 {  { - } } 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ forms as the first stage,presumably due to the deposition of inorganic ions and high relative molecular mass organic compounds.This film isable to alter the electrostatic charges and wettability of the metal surface,in turn facilitating colonization by bacteria on the surface[36].EPS usually comprises a wide variety of organic compounds including proteins，polysaccharides,humic acid substances,lipid,DNAs,and so on [37]. Soon after the formation of the film,the microbial growth and EPS production result in the development of a biofilm.However,even though the bacteria have been interconnected in some areas in particular those close to the pores (Fig.2 b-3), the bacteria-related biofilm is not homogeneous.Further elongated soaking of the coating samples in the bacteria-containing ASW resulted in the formation of continuous biofilm on their surfaces (Fig.2 a-4,b-4).30 days immersion of the samples already gave rise to full coverage of the surfaces of the coatings by a homogeneous biofilm.While shorter incubation duration only resulted in uncontinuous localized colonization of the bacteria.The biofilmwas furthercharacterized by EDXanalysis and FTIR detection (Fig.3). For comparison purpose,the Al/nano${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ composite coating was also characterized by FTIR(Fig.3a). The appearance of Al in the biofilm as detected by EDX(Fig.3b) might suggest dissolution of Al during the incubation,since metal binding by EPS involves interaction between metal ions and anionic functional groups (e.g.carboxyl, phosphate,sulfate,glycerate,pyruvate and succinate groups) that are common as the protein and carbohydrate components of exopolymers [38].However,no other metal ions were detected in the biofilm,suggesting the major components of the biofilmas the bacteria and EPS.The IR spectrum for the biofilm shown in Fig.3a reveals a strongabsorption peak at ${ \sim } 3 4 2 0 \ c \mathrm m ^ { - 1 }$ reflecting stretching vibrations of $_ { 0 - \mathrm { H } }$ (the functional group in polysaccharides and proteins)and ${ \sim } 1 0 2 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ assigned to $- C O -$ stretching (glycopeptides,ribose). The IR band located at $1 6 6 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ refers to $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { C } } = 0$ and $_ { C - \mathsf { N } }$ (Amide I) stretching,and the peak at $1 5 4 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ reflects combination of $\mathsf { N { \mathrm { - } } H }$ bending and $_ { C - \mathsf { N } }$ (Amide II) stretching(Amide Iand Amide II corresponded to the functional groups in proteins)[37,39]. Nevertheless,extensive understanding of the bioflm is essential for clarifying the biofouling behavior of the coatings.Further characterization of the biofilm is required.Inaddition,only limited information is currentlyavailable on the correlation between the physical characteristics of substrate materials and biofilm formation.Among the surface properties of the materials,surface roughness is believed to be an important factor affecting the formation and composition of the biofilm [40]. Rough surface favors bacterial attachment [41].In this case,the inherently rough surfaces of the thermal sprayed Al coatingsare further roughened by the $\mathsf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 }$ particles added in the coatings [42]. This probably contributes in part to the formation of the more homogeneous biofilm on the composite surface.

The effect of the biofilm on the electrochemical corrosion performances of the coatings was investigated.Electrochemical impedance measurements suggest the positive effect brought about by the bacteria-associated biofilm on corrosion resistance of the coatings (Fig.4b).For comparison purposes,the corrosion behavior of the coatings soaked in the ASW without the bacteria were initiallyassessed (Fig.4and Fig.S1 in the Supplemental Data). Since it has been realized that one month incubation already resulted in formation of homogeneous biofilm on the surfaces of the coatings,obviously the biofilm significantly enhanced the impedance value of the coatings (Fig.4 a-2 vs.a-1,and b-2 vs.b-1). It is found that the electrochemical impedance value increases as the incubation time of the coating samples in the solution is prolonged,predominantly due to formation of a passive layer on the coating surfaces.The composite coating with the addition of nano ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ shows better corrosion resistance than the pure Al coating in both the testing environments (Fig.4b vs.a).Itis likely that the ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ nanoparticles incorporated into the coatings actas insulators on the surfaces of the coatings.Similar results have also been realized for micron-sized ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ particles-incorporated Al coatings [43].The enhanced anti-corrosion performances are consistent with other reports that degradation of the coatings even at long immersion time isalleviated in the presence of the nanoparticles [44,45]. This could be explained by the strengthened resistance of the coatings by the nano $\mathsf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 }$ particlesagainst hydrolytic degradation and corrosive electrolyte diffusion [44].During the corrosion testing, the small size and large surface area of the nanoparticles certainly result in decrease in the number of transport paths for corrosive electrolyte diffusion through the coating.In fact,the nanoparticles could significantly enhance the barrier properties of the coating.

Bacterial adhesion to a surface is a complicated process,which is affected by various physicochemical properties of both bacterial cellsand substratum surfaces [46].The electrochemical testing data shows that as the immersion time increases,the low frequency arc becomes more important and the corrosion resistance increases. SEMcharacterizationalreadydisclosed that the bacterialadhesion occurred near the flaws located on the surfaces of the coatings (Fig.2 b-3),from where biofilm started to form.The Nyquist spectra for the coatings in the two testing media show two time constants (Fig.4).Based on the EIS results,as well as the electrochemical studies proposed by Szczygiel et al.[47] on composite coatings containing ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ ,an EIS equivalent circuit for the coatings is proposed,as shown in Fig.5.The equivalent circuit models take into account the contribution of various phenomena,such as electrical double layer,biofilm formation,laminar coating structure and others.For the coating samples incubated in the bacteriacontaining ASW for 3O days,the model differs from the one describing the samples incubated for7 days (Fig.5 b versus a). For thesamples incubated for3O days,apart froma passive filmand the double layer,a continuous dense biofilm was readily formed on the coating surfaces for both the Al and the Al/nano- ${ \cdot \mathord { \mathsf { A l } } _ { 2 } } { 0 } _ { 3 }$ composite coatings.

According to the proposed models,the calculated parameters relevant to the impedance results are listed in Table 1. $R _ { c t } Q _ { d l }$ describes the electrode Faraday process(corrosion process) and corresponds to low-frequency impedance,while the circuit $R _ { c o a t } Q _ { c o a t }$ represents the processes blocking the coating surface and corresponds to high-frequency impedance.The higher frequency time constantisrelated to the solution/coating interface,and the lower frequency time constant is related to the solution/substrate interface.It is noted that the impedance value increases forall the coating samples after 3O days incubation.This can be well explained since it is likely that protective film or stabilized preexisting protective film can be easily resulted on metal surface which could be accounted for by the fine structure nature of the composite coating and the role of the $\mathsf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 }$ nanoparticles as insulators staying on the coating surfaces.It therefore indicates that in presence of the E.coli,the bacteria opt to attach on the surface of the coatings,in turn forming the biofilm. The biofilm acts as a protective layer in the corrosive environment. In absence of the bacteria,the corrosive liquid penetrates relatively easily through the coating.

Further potentiodynamic polarization examination for the coatings incubated in the ASW with/without the bacteria suggests consistent results with those suggested by the electrochemical analyses (Fig.6).In the presence of the bacteria, the corrosion potentials of the coatings shift negatively,but corrosion current densities drop at both exposure times.As expected from the EIS results,the corrosion current density $I _ { c o r r }$ for the $\mathsf { A l / n a n o - A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ composite coating is lower than that for the pure Al coating regardless of presence or absence of the bacteria.In the presence of the bacteria,both the anodic and the cathodic curves shiftto the left and the anodic and cathodic currents were decreased after 7 days and30 days.The corrosion current density is lower for the bacteriacontaining solution than in the pure ASW solution.As discussed in previous section,the decreased $I _ { c o r r }$ after incubation of the coatings in the solutions is probably attributed to the formation of the bacteria-associated biofilmand the possible oxide layer formed on the surfaces of the coatings.These layers act as barrier protecting [36].The simulated EIS results also suggest enhanced corrosion impedances of the coatings with increased exposure time.In this case,the charge transfer resistance, $R _ { c t } ,$ for the composite coating is higher than that for the pure Al coating.The highly increased $R _ { c t }$ value implies high corrosion resistance.For both the coatings,a significant shiftin $R _ { c t }$ with exposure time was observed.This shift is presumably due to the formation of the biofilm and stabilized preexisting protective film,which is evidenced by the better corrosion resistance exhibited by the samples than the samples incubated in the ASW without the bacteria.After 30 days,the $R _ { c t }$ for the Al and the composite coatings in presence of the bacteria reaches $1 0 { , } 2 9 0 \Omega \mathrm { ~ c m } ^ { 2 }$ and $1 9 , 6 9 0 \Omega \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ ,respectively.Moreover, the $R _ { c t }$ of the composite coating remains higher than that of the Al coating, the coatings from penetration of aggressive solutions,giving rise to the enhanced corrosion resistance.The electrochemical corrosion variables,namely corrosion potential, $E _ { c o r r } ,$ corrosion current density, $I _ { c o r r } { , }$ anodic Tafel slope, $b _ { a }$ ，and cathodic Tafel slope, $b _ { c } ,$ are listed in Table 2.The extrapolation of anodic and cathodic Tafel lines gives the corrosion current density at the corrosion potential; and it should start $5 0 { - } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ away from $E _ { c o r r }$ [48].However,Mansfeld [49] proposed that when the accurate Tafel slopes are not available, theycould be determined from the pre-Tafel region in the vicinity of $\mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { c o r r } } .$ In this work,the cathodic and anodic branches don't show Tafelbehaviorin the range of $5 0 { - } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ ；sotheregions of the cathodic and anodic branches were selected in the range of $3 0 { - } 4 0 \mathrm { m V }$ .The corrosion current density of the composite coatings in presence of E.coli after 30 days incubation is $0 . 7 8 8 \mu \mathrm { A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ ,much lower than that of the Al coating, $1 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ ,indicating better anticorrosion performances of the composite coatings.

Formation of ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ passive filmis likelyafter the immersion of the Al-based coatingsin the ASW,which canbe explained bythe following reaction: $2 A l + 3 H _ { 2 } O  A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } + 6 H ^ { + } + 6 e ^ { - }$ ： ${ \sf A l } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 }$ film is not stable in water and tends to change to $\mathsf { A l } ( \mathsf { O H } ) _ { 3 }$ .Accumulation of the oxide/hydroxide film on the electrode surface diminishes dissolution of Al.Presence of chloride easily triggers breakdown of this film by the interaction between $\mathsf { A l } ( \mathsf { O H } ) _ { 3 }$ film and ${ \sf C l } ^ { - }$ ions, which produces ${ \mathsf { A l C l } } _ { 3 }$ after sufficiently long time [50,51].Formation ofbiofilm in presence of the bacteria probably stabilizes the oxide layer and in turn prevents the failure of the film.The FESEM images of the coatings after the Tafel polarization testing showed clearly the damaged oxide layer,resulting in occurrence of pitting(data not shown).In fact,presence of chloride has been detected by EDX within the damaged oxide layer (Fig.3b).Furthermore，the decreased values of $I _ { C o r r }$ and increased $R _ { c t }$ also indicate enhanced passivation of the Al coating by the addition of nano $\mathsf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 }$ particles, which needs to be further investigated.

# 4.Conclusions

The simplified biofilm model constituted by E.coli bacteriaand the bacteria-associated secretions was employed for investigating the corrosion behavior of thermal sprayed Al and $\mathsf { A l / n a n o - A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ coatings in artificial seawater.Colonization of the bacteria on the surfaces of the coatings was followed byaccumulation formation of a homogeneous biofilm.Electrochemical testing revealed significantly enhanced corrosion resistance of the coatings after full homogeneous coverage of the biofilm.The results shed some light on future elucidating the biocorrosion of thermal sprayed inorganic marine coatings and in turn provide insight into design of their microstructures for enhanced properties.
