# Abstract

Purpose: Vaccinia virus has strong potential as a novel therapeutic agent for treatment of pancreatic cancer. We investigated whether arming vaccinia virus with interleukin-10 (IL10) could enhance the antitumor efficacy with the view that IL10 might dampen the host immunity to the virus, increasing viral persis tence, thus maximizing the oncolytic effect and antitumor immu nityassociated with vaccinia virus.

Experimental Design: The antitumor efficacy of IL1O-armed vaccinia virus (VVL△TK-IL1O) and control VV△TK wasassessed in pancreatic cancer cell lines, mice bearing subcutaneous pancreatic cancer tumors and a pancreatic cancer transgenic mouse model. Viral persistencewithin the tumorswas examined and immune depletion experiments as well as immunophenotyping of splenocytes were carried out to dissect the functional mechanisms associated with the viral efficacy.

Results: Compared with unarmed VVL△TK, VVL△TK-IL10 had a similar level of cytotoxicity and replication in vitro in murine pancreatic cancer cell lines,but rendered a superior antitumor efficacy in the subcutaneous pancreatic cancer model and a K-ras-p53 mutant-transgenic pancreatic cancer model aftersystemic delivery,with induction of long-term antitumor immunity. The antitumor efficacy of VVL△TK-IL10 was dependent on $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ ，but not NK cells. Clearance of VVL△TK-IL10 was reduced at early time points compared with thecontrol virus. Treatment with VVL△TK-IL1O resulted in a reduction in virus-specific, but not tumor-specific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells comparedwithVVL△TK.

Conclusions: These results suggest that VVL△TK-IL10 has strong potentialasanantitumor therapeuticfor pancreatic cancer. Clin Cancer Res;21(2); 405-16. @2014 AACR.

# Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide(1) and remains consistentlylethal with a 5-year survival rate of less than $5 \%$ .This situation signifies a need for radically new therapeutic strategies that are not subject to crossresistance with conventional therapies.

Oncolytic viruses have emerged as attractive therapeutic candidates for cancer treatment due to their inherent ability to specifically target and lyse tumor cells and induce antitumor effects.An engineered replication-competent Adenovirus,dl1520 (ONYX-O15),was the first of these viruses to be tested for human pancreatic cancer treatment. The treatments were well tolerated, but no objective responses with virus therapy alone were seen in any of the patients (2).

Vaccina virus has strong potential for exploitation as both an oncolyticagent and vectorfor therapeutic gene delivery to tumors. Extremelypromisingclinical trial datahaverecentlyemerged in which GM-CSF-armed vaccinia virus induced objective responses in patients with liver,colon,kidney,and lung cancer and melanoma (3,4).Vaccinia virus has several inherent features that make it particularly suitable for use as an oncolytic agent, including fast and efficient replication with rapid cell-to-cell spread,natural tropism for tumors,a well-documented safety record,and an ability to replicate inmany different cell types,a feature not shared byadenoviruses.We recentlydemonstrated thathypoxia,which contributes to the aggressive and treatment-resistant phenotype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC;ref.5)，does not inhibit and may even enhance the potency of oncolytic vaccinia virus (6).In addition, vaccinia virus has recently been shown to be effective at human tumor targeting after intravenous delivery (4).

Interleukin-1O (IL1O),first described as a factor produced by Th2 clones capable of inhibiting Th1 cytokine production (7), is a potent inhibitor of T cell-mediated antiviral responses by pre vention of dendritic cell (DC) activation of the $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } T h 1 }$ inflammatorypathway (8,9).IL1O isa keyplayer in the establishment

# Translational Relevance

Oncolytic virotherapy is beginning to show promise as a realistic alternative to standard cancer therapeutics. To date, clinical trials have proved this strategy safe and well tolerated by patients; however, clinical responses after treatment with virus alone have been modest. A new generation of oncolytic viruses that engage the host immune system in the attack against the tumor are providing more encouraging clinical results.This study demonstrates that vaccinia virus armed with the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL1o) is a novel and extremely promising therapeutic for treatment of pancreatic tumors and prevention of disease recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms by which IL10 improves oncolytic virotherapy provides a foundation for the rational design of clinical trials for treatment of pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors with this virusand providesvaluable information for the design of future antitumor strategies that aim to combine oncolytic virotherapy with immunotherapeutic approaches.

the foundation for translation of this therapeutic into a clinical setting.

# Materials and Methods

# Celllines and viruses

The murine PDAC cell line DT6606 and the preinvasive pancreatic cancer (PanIN) cell line DT4994 were cultured from LSL-KrasG12D/+;Pdx-1-Cre mice that had developed PDAC (29). These were kindly provided by David Tuveson (Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute, Cambridge,United Kingdom; nowat Cold SpringHarborLaboratory).The DT6606-ovalbumin (OVA) stable cell line was created by transfection of DT66o6 cells at with pCI-neo-cOVA (Addgene） using Effectene transfection reagent(Qiagen) according to the manufacturers'protocol.CV1 (African monkey kidney) cells and PT45 (human pancreatic carcinoma) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Construction and production of recombinant vaccinia virus Lister strains VVL△TK-IL1O (rVV-IL1O,armed with murine IL10) and VVL△TK (rVV-L15) were previously described (30, 31).

and perpetuationof viral persistence in vivo (1o,11).Therefore, arming vaccinia virus with IL1O may prolong viral persistence and enhance the antitumor efficacy. IL1o has historically been regarded as an immunosuppressive cytokine that has extensively been described in association with cancer,including pancreatic cancer(12,13),asa mechanism of tumor escape from immunosurveillance(14，15)．However，accumulatingevidence demonstrates that IL1O also has immunostimulatory and antitumor properties(16).Functional mechanisms investigated include activation of natural killer(NK) cells (17) that have been associated with tumor clearance in murine models of breast and colorectal cancer(18);inhibition of angiogenesis; enhancement ofmacrophage infiltration into tumors (19);and prevention of metastasis by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (20).A number of preclinical (21) and clinical trials have consistently demonstrated safety of IL1O administration in treatment of diseases,including psoriasis (22),Crohn disease (23),and chronic hepatitis C infection (24),which make a strong case for its use as a therapeutic modalityin cancer.IL1O has been reported to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of a vaccinia virus-based vaccine against murine cancer cells (25),which may be connected to its ability to enhance the growth and proliferation ofTcells (26) or its role as a chemotactic agent for $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells.Unfortunately, the half-life of IL1O is only approximately 20 minutes and it is diffcult to maintain a high concentration after administration of recombinant protein (27).Nonreplicating adenovirus-mediated deliveryhas shown promise in retaining therapeutically effective levels of IL10 in vivo (28). Given its pleiotropic effects, IL10 may be an effective agent with which to improve the antitumor potential of vaccinia virus.

In this study,we have testedaLister strain,TK-deleted replicating vaccinia virus armed with murine IL1O (VVL△TK-IL10) in subcutaneous and transgenic murine models of pancreatic cancer and demonstrated that VVL△TK-IL1O has far superior antitumor activity compared withunarmed vaccinia virus (VVL△TK),resulting in almost complete tumor clearance,significantly increased survival times,and the production of long-term tumor immunity in the host. Our results suggest that VVL△TK-IL10 has strong potential as an effective treatment for pancreatic cancer and lays

# Vaccinia virus replication assay

Appropriate cell lines were seeded in triplicate and infected 16 hours later with VVL△TK or VVL△TK-IL1O at a multiplicity of infection (MOl) of 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per cell. Cells and supernatant were collected at 24，48,and 72 hours after infection and titers were determined by measuring the median tissue culture infective dose $\mathrm { ( T C I D } _ { 5 0 } )$ on indicator CV1 cells.The Reed-Muench mathematical method wasused to calculate the $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ value for each sample (32).Viral burst titerswere converted to PFU per cell based on the number of cells present at viral infection. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test was used to assess significance.

# Cell cytotoxicity assay

The cytotoxicity of the viruses in each cell line was assessed 6 days after infection with virus using an MTS nonradioactive cell proliferation assaykit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions,which allowed determination of an $\mathrm { E C } _ { 5 0 }$ value (dose required to kill $5 0 \%$ of cells).

# Real-timequantitativePCR

Subcutaneous tumors collected from treated mice were homogenized before DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.TaqMan system primers and probes (Supplementary Table S1） were designed using Primer Express v3.0 software (Applied Biosystems） and constructed by Sigma-Aldrich and Applied Biosystems,respectively. Samples,controls,and standardswere tested in triplicate by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using 750o Real-time PCR System.Results were normalized to NanoDrop readings and expressed as genome copy number/0.01 g tumor tissue. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test was used to assess significance.

# IL10 and interferon- $\boldsymbol { \gamma }$ ELISA

IL10 or interferon-γ (IFNγ) protein levels were quantified using an IL1O-specific or IFNy-specific ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Where appropriate, data were normalized to cell number present at time of infection.

# Splenocyte preparation

Spleens were extracted from mice,combined with complete Tcell medium (RPMI medium, $1 0 \%$ BCS, $1 \%$ penicillin-streptomycin, and $1 \%$ sodium pyruvate),and cells were separated using a ${ 7 0 } { \cdot } { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ cell strainer. Cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich),washed in PBS,and the pellet was resuspended in T-cell medium.

# In vitro splenocyte restimulation

Cells $( 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } )$ were aliquotted into each well of a 96-well plate induplicate.Cells were restimulated with either a vaccinia virus-specific B8R peptide(TSYKFESV;Proimmune) at a final concentration of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m L }$ or $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ mitomycin C-treated DT6606-OVA cells.Restimulated splenocytes were incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 5 \%$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ for 72 hours and the supernatant was collected.

# Tumor cell preparation

Tumor cell suspensions were prepared by incubation with $1 \times$ collagenase/hyaluronidase (STEMCELL TECHNOLOGIES） for 30 minutes at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 、Cells were separated using a ${ 7 0 } { \cdot } { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ cell strainerand resuspended in complete T-cell medium.

# Immunophenotyping of splenocytes and tumors

All fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were supplied by eBiosciences and used ata 1:2oo dilution.The B8R and OVA H-2Kb-restricted,MHC class I pentamers were synthesized by Proimmune and used at a 1:2o dilution.

Splenocytes and tumors were prepared and aliquotted into 96- well U-bottom plates.Pentamer staining was carried out by resuspending cells in FACS buffer (FB; $\mathrm { P B S } + 1 \%$ heat-inactivated $\mathrm { B C S } { + } 0 . 1 \% \mathrm { N a N } _ { 3 }$ ）plus pentamer and incubating at room temperature for 1O minutes. Cells were washed before being incubated in FB plus appropriate fluorescent marker-conjugated antiimmune cell marker antibodies for 3O minutes on ice.Cells were washed and fixed in $2 \%$ formalin before analysis using a BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer.Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc).

# In vivo studies

All animal studies were carried outunder the terms of the Home Office Project Licence PPL 7O/6o30 and subject to Queen Mary University of London ethical review,according to the guidelines for the welfare and use of animals in cancer research (33).

The C57/BL6 mouse is H-2 haplotype-identical to the injected DT6606 cells thus DT6606 allografts could be establishedin the right flank of 3-to 4-week male C57/BL6 mice by injecting $3 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ DT6606 cells.When tumors reached around $0 . 6 \ \mathrm { c m }$ in diameter,mice were stratified by tumor size into groups of 8 and received $1 0 0 \mathrm { - \mu L }$ intratumoral (i.t.) injections of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ PFU of VVL△TK,VVL△TK-IL10,or PBS daily for5 days. Tumor size was measured twice weekly until the death of the first animal in each group and volume was estimated [volume $\ c =$ （204号 $\mathrm { ( l e n g t h \times w i d t h ^ { 2 } \times \pi ) / 6 } ]$ .Survival analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests used to assess significance.Mice that had cleared tumor after treatment wererechallenged 4 weeks after clearance in the opposite flank with $4 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ DT6606 cells and tumor volume Was estimated as previously.For immune depletion studies, DT66O6 subcutaneous tumors were established as described and1 day before commencement of viral treatment $2 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ of anti- $\mathrm { C D 4 ~ I g G }$ (antibody clone GK1.5),anti-CD8 IgG (antibody clone TIB210),anti-NK IgG (antibody clone PK136),or control rat IgG was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.） in $2 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { L }$ PBS. Injections were continued twice weekly for the duration of the experiment and FACS analysis was used to verify depletion for the duration of the experiment.Five mice per group were treated and the experiment was carried out twice.

# Transgenic mice

LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice were kindly provided by David Tuveson(Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute) and have been described previously (29).Mice were treated when they reached 2.5 months, previously demonstrated to be the mean age at which PanINhas progressed to PDAC (29). Mice were treated i.p. with $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ PFU/injection VVL△TKorVVL△TK-IL10 on days1,3,and5.Mice were examined daily for signs of disease progression and culled when they showed symptoms of sickness. Survival data were compared using Prism(GraphPad Software) and a log-rank (Mantel Cox) test was used to determine significance of survival differences.

# In vivo imaging

Seven days after treatment of KPC or KP mice,the biodistribution of VVL△TK was determined in anesthetized animals ( $2 \%$ isofluorane inhalation) afteri.p.injection of D-luciferin ( $\mathrm { \dot { 2 } 5 0 m g / }$ kg; Xenogen) and fluorescence measured with the IVIS camera (Xenogen Corp.).

# Histopathologic examination and immunohistochemistry for viral proteins

KPC or control KP mice(2.5-month old) were treated i.p.with 2 $\times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ PFU/injection VVL△TKor VVL△TK-IL10 on days 1,3,and 5. Onrelevant days,animals were sacrificed, the pancreas removed, snap-frozen,and stored at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ Frozen tissue was processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC） analysis of vaccinia virus coat protein [1:5O rabbit anti-vaccinia virus coat protein polyclonal antibody(MorphoSysUKLtd.)],macrophage[1:2,0o0 anti-F4/80 antibody (Serotech)], $\mathrm { C D } 3 ^ { + }$ T cell [1:200 anti-CD3 antibody (BioLegend)],or $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cell [1:300 anti-CD8 antibody(BioLegend)] as described previously (31).

# Results

# VVL△TK-IL1O replicates efficiently in vitro in murine cancer cell lines derived from a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer

To determine whether inclusion of IL10 affected on characteristics of VVL△TK in vitro,replication and cytotoxicity in three cell lines were examined;DT66o6,representing late-stage invasive PDAC and DT4994, representing PanIN, were both derived from the K-ras transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer (29). DT6606-OVA,in which the OVA antigen is overexpressed in DT6606 cells，was also examined.All cell lines supported production of infectious virions of VVL△TK and VVL△TK-IL10 (Fig.1A-C) and IL1O did not act to inhibit nor promote viral replication. The $\mathrm { E C } _ { 5 0 }$ was comparable between VVL△TK and VVL△TK-IL1o (Fig.1D). Furthermore, IL1O was expressed in all three cellines over72 hours after infection (Fig.1E).Thus,arming VVL△TK with IL10 does not adversely affect the in vitro oncolytic effect desired for our virotherapy strategy.

VVL△TK-IL10 infection was also assessed in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PT45 to demonstrate potential translation of this therapy into human cells.VV△TK-IL1O showed effcient replication,cytotoxicity,and IL1O expression in this cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1).

# VVL△TK-IL10 shows superior antitumor efficacy compared with VVL△TK in immunocompetent mouse models of pancreatic cancer

In vivo efficacy of VVL△TK-IL1O was examined usinga subcutaneously established pancreatic cancer model.DT6606 subcutaneous tumors were established in male C57/BL6 mice and the animals received i.t. injections of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ PFU of VVL△TK,VVL△TK-IL1O,or PBSdaily for5 days.The selected viral dose was 10 times lower than the most commonly reported $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ PFU/dose in the literature (34). Both VVL△TK and VVL△TK-IL1O demonstrated antitumor efficacy (Fig. 2A). However,treatment with VVL△TK-IL1O resulted in a superior antitumor efficacy by day 44,with $8 7 . 5 \%$ of mice showing tumor clearance and significantly improved overall survival rates compared with both VVL△TK- and PBS-treated animals (Fig.2B).The C57/Black6 mouse is H-2 haplotype-identical to the injected DT66O6 cells.Growth of tumors in PBS-treated animals confirmed that there was no immunologic rejection of the DT66o6 cell line due to MHC or minor antigen mismatches.

TodeterminewhetherVVL△TK-IL10 remainedefficacious in a more pathologically relevant model of pancreatic cancer, KPC transgenic mice were used. In these mice, pancreas-specific expression of mutant $K r a s ^ { \mathbf G 1 2 D }$ and $T r p 5 3 ^ { R I 7 2 H }$ results in progressive development of PDAC(35).Three doses of virus (2 $\times ~ \bar { 1 0 } ^ { 8 }$ PFU/day) were given i.p. to 2.5-month old,PDACbearing mice.To confirm the specificity of virus for pancreatic tumors afteri.p.injection,VVL△TK,which expresses a luciferase transgene in the viral TK region,was injected into either experimental KPC mice or control KP mice.Two days later, mice were imaged for luciferase expression (Fig. 2C). Strong luciferase signals were obtained specifically in the pancreatic area of KPC transgenic mice (Fig.2C,left),while no signal was obtained from control mice (Fig.2C, right). The vaccinia virus proteins were expressed in cancer cells and proliferative acinar cells in KPC mice (Fig. $2 \mathrm { C } ,$ left,bottom),whereas no viral protein expression was observed in the ductal epithelial cells and acinar cells in KP mice (Fig.2C, right, bottom),confirming specificity of replication of TK-deleted vaccinia virus for pancreatic tumorcells.Efficacy of viral treatment in this model was assessed by survival (Fig.2D).Treatment with VVL△TK-IL10 resulted in significantly improved survival rates compared with treatmentwith VVL△TK.Mean survival time for VVL△TK-IL10- treated animals after commencement of treatment was 138.5 days compared with 69.7 days for VVL△TK-treated animals, suggestingVVL△TK-IL1O as an extremely effective treatment for PDACs even in the most complex murine models of the disease.

# Treatment with VVL△TK-IL1O results in long-term protection against disease recurrence

Successful OV strategies aim not only to eradicate the primary tumor,but also to induce long-term antitumor immunity to prevent disease recurrence.Thus,animals were rechallenged with $\mathsf { \Pi } _ { 4 } \times \mathsf { \Pi } _ { 1 0 } { } ^ { 6 }$ DT6606 cells 4 weeks after complete regression of the primary tumor (Fig.3A).Treatment with both viruses resulted in long-term immunity to DT66o6 tumor cells as evidenced by rapid clearance of these cells that necessitated no further viral treatments.Interestingly,VVL△TK-IL1O-treated animals were able to clear the secondary tumor more quickly and more consistently than VVL△TK-treated animals.

# $\mathbf { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ and $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ ,but not NK cells,are required for VVL△TKIL10 efficacy in vivo

Long-term immunity suggests an activation of specific antitumorimmune responses after treatment.To assess the contribution of different immune cells to treatment efficacy, $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ $\mathrm { C D 4 } ^ { + }$ or

NK immune subsets were depleted from mice before treatment of subcutaneous DT6606 tumors With VVL△TK-IL1O (Fig. 3B). Depletion of both $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells had a significantly detrimental effect on the efficacy of treatment，suggesting VVL△TK-IL1O is acting via these immune subsets to eliminate the tumor. Surprisingly, given previous reports that IL1O can activate NK cells to mediate tumor clearance(17),depletion of NK cells in our experiment had no effect on treatment efficacy.

# Tumor-associated activated T-cell and macrophage populations are altered after treatment with VVL△TK-IL1O compared with VVL△TK,which affects viral persistence

Given the involvement of T cells in VVL△TK-IL1O treatment efficacy,tumor T-cell populations were analyzed in more detail. Pancreatic tumors of KPC transgenic mice treated as previously were harvested posttreatment and T-cell populations analyzed by IHC.We noted a significant increase in $\mathrm { C D 3 ^ { + } C D 8 ^ { + } }$ infiltrate after treatment with both viruses compared with PBS (Supplementary Fig.S2）and a significant increase in $\mathrm { C D 3 ^ { + } C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells in VVL△TK-IL1O-treated animalsatday22after infectioncompared with VVL△TK-treated animals.

DT66o6-subcutaneous tumors were also harvested foranalysis of T-cell populations by FACS.In accordance with data obtained from KPC mice,we found a significant increase in tumor T-cell infiltrate after treatment with both viruses,with a significant increase in $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ infiltrate into tumors of VVL△TK-IL1O-treated animals (Fig. 4A).However, most interesting Was that in $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ (data not shown） and,more significantly, $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ populations (Fig. 4B), the proportion of activated $( \mathrm { C D 4 5 R B ^ { \mathrm { l o } } / C D 4 4 ^ { \mathrm { h i } } } )$ T cells in tumors treated with VVL△TK was higher than those treated with VVL△TK-IL10．IFNy expression within VVL△TK-IL1O-treated tumorswasalsosignificantlyreducedcomparedwith VVL△TK-treated tumors (Fig. 4C).

Tumor-associated macrophage populations were also assessed in KPC(Supplementary Fig.S3) and DT6606 tumor-bearing mice (Fig.4D) after infection.We found that treatment with either virus increased macrophage infiltrate into tumors of KPC mice compared withPBS,but that treatment with VVL△TK-IL1O resulted in a reduced macrophage tumor infiltrate compared with treatment with VVL△TK.This result was mirrored in DT6606 tumor-bearing mice.Further assessment of macrophage activation status in the DT6606 subcutaneous model revealed that VVL△TK-IL10 induces a downregulation of MHCII expression compared with VVL△TK (Fig. 4E).

To assess the impact of these phenomena on viral persistence, viral DNA load in the tumors (6 mice/group/time point) was analyzedafteri.t.treatmentatdays8,16,and24afterinfection using qPCR (Fig. 4F,i) and $\mathrm { T C I D } _ { 5 0 }$ (Fig. 4F,ii).We found that by day 24,both viruses had been cleared from the tumor to the same extent,butatdays12and16,significantly more VVL△TK-IL10 was recovered from tumors than VVL△TK, indicatinga delay in clearanceofVVL△TK-IL1O compared with VVL△TK.Theseresultswere confirmed by IHC analysis of viral load in pancreatic tumors of KPC mice (Supplementary Fig. S4).

# The splenic $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ and $\mathbf { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cell populations are altered after treatment with VVL△TK-IL10 compared with treatment with VVL△TK

It isclear that VVL△TK-IL1O treatment efficacy involvesmodulation of the immune system, thus splenicimmune cell population dynamics in response to treatment were assessed in greater detail.

DT66O6 tumor-bearing mice were treated as described and their spleens collected and assessed for presence of various immune cell subsets.No differences were found in splenic B cell ( $\mathrm { \cdot } 8 2 2 0 ^ { + }$ cells), Treg $\mathrm { [ C D 4 ^ { + } }$ $\mathrm { C D } 2 5 ^ { \mathrm { h i } }$ cells)，NK $\mathrm { C D 3 ^ { - } } ,$ $\mathrm { C D 4 9 b ^ { + } }$ cells),or NKT populations $( \mathrm { C D } 3 ^ { + } ,$ $\mathrm { C D 4 9 b ^ { + } }$ cells)after treatment with either virus compared with PBS-treated animals (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Analysis of $\mathrm { C D 4 } ^ { + }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ populations revealed that frequencies of these populations were altered at early time points (Fig. 5A and $\mathrm { D } ;$ Supplementary Fig. S6).At days 8 and 16,a significant increase in the frequency of total $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells was seen after treatment with either virus;however,VVL△TK-IL1O treatment resulted in fewer total $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells than treatment with VVL△TK (Fig. 5D).This phenomenon was also observed in the $\mathrm { C D 4 } ^ { + }$ populations at day 16 after treatment (Fig. 5A).

Further examination revealed that after treatmentwith VVL△TK-IL10 or VVL△TK, T-cell populations shifted toward an effector/memory phenotype (Fig. 5B-F) at days 8 and 16.However, VVL△TK-IL1O induced statistically feweractivated $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells than VVL△TK at days 8 and 16 after infection (Fig. 5B-F),as noted previously within the tumor.

# VVL△TK-IL1O treatment results in reduced antiviral immune responses compared with treatment with VVL△TK,but an increased frequency of tumor-specific T cells

To clarify the proportions of virus-specific and tumor-specific splenic effector $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells elicited after treatment with VVL△TK and VVL△TK-IL10,splenocytes from DT6606-OVA tumor-bearing animals were analyzed.For virus-specificTcells,anMHCI-specific pentamer against an immunogenic vaccinia virus antigen, $\mathrm { B 8 R } ,$ wasused (Fig. 6Aand SupplementaryFig. S7A).As expected, viral treatment resulted in detection of B8R-specific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells in both treatment groups.However，VVL△TK-treated animals had a significantly higher proportion of B8R-specific T cells than VVL△TK-IL1O-treated animals at all time points，suggesting a decreased virus-specific immune response after treatment with VVL△TK-IL10,which could account for the fewer effector $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells noted after VVL△TK-IL1O treatment.We confirmed the decreased frequency of antivirus-specific T cells using an in vitro restimulation assay,in which IFNy production from splenocytes in response to B8R peptide restimulation was measured (Fig. 6B). At all time points,significantly less IFNy was detected from VVL△TKIL10 treatment groups compared with VVL△TK treatment groups.

To assess T-cell reaction to tumor antigens,an MHCI OVAspecific pentamer was used in FACS staining (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S7B).At day 8,no differences in OVA-specific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ Tcells was observed after treatment with either virus when compared withPBS;however,byday16,VVL△TK-IL1O-treated animals showed an increase in production of OVA-specific antigens compared with VVL△TK-treated animals. This result was reflected in restimulation assays (Fig. 6D).

Taken together, these results indicate that although VVL△TKIL1O treatment resulted in a reduction in antiviral T-cell production, the frequency of antitumor-specific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells was comparable oreven increased compared with VVL△TK-treated mice.

# Discussion

Efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy is dependent on both the oncolytic action of the virus itself and the effective stimulation of a local immune response to viral infection (36,37). Oncolytic viruses may represent a method of achieving vaccination in situ, enabling the adaptive arm of the immune system to clear residual disease and provide long-term surveillance against relapse. To date,however,the use of oncolytic viruses alone has proved unsuccessful in clinical trials and this is likely due to their early clearance preventing their oncolytic effects and an effective immune-stimulating release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Many viruses encode homologs of the cytokine IL1O,generally considered immunosuppressive, to dampen the antiviral immune response and circumvent early viral clearance (11,38).We aimed to adopt this natural strategy of viruses by arming vaccinia virus with IL1O,which has been reported to be effective at prevention of vaccinia virus clearance (39).We hypothesized that prolonging viral persistence in the host would improve the antitumor effcacy by enhancing both the direct oncolytic effect and release of TAAs.

The pancreatic cancer subcutaneous tumor model we developed was based on the use of a DT66o6 cell line,which was originally derived from the transgenic KPC spontaneous model of pancreatic cancer (29),and therefore accurately reflect the PDAC populations of cells within these mice.Previous study has demonstrated that these cancer cells resemble human PDAC in many respects,including their expression of oncogenic KrasG12D and the TAA mesothelin,and both spontaneous and subcutaneous tumors show similarhistopathologic features such as the presence of $\mathrm { F A P ^ { + } }$ stromal cells (40).

The long-held paradigm of IL1o function suggests it as an immunosuppressive cytokine,commonly investigated therapeutically in the context of treatment for inflammatory autoimmune conditions and allograft survival (41,42).However, using these two different murine models of pancreatic cancer, weobserved significantly enhanced therapeutic responses after treatment with our IL1O-armed vaccinia virus compared with unarmed virus.In both models,low doses of the virus were sufficient to induce objective responses and in agreement with previous reports,no IL1O-related toxicity was observed (43). Treatment also resulted in rejection of tumors after rechallenge, confirming the development of effective long-term immunity against tumor antigens.These results are consistent with those of others investigating the antitumor properties of IL1o in which systemic administration of recombinant protein or tumor cells transfected with IL1O induced tumor clearance and long-term memory responses in mice bearing sarcoma (16), melanoma(16，44)，colorectal cancers (16)，breast cancers (45),and prostate cancers (20).

In vitro studies indicated that IL1O did not alter vaccinia virus replication or cytotoxicity and no effect on cell proliferation was observed.To determine other possible mechanisms for the superior efficacy associated with this virus,viral persistence within tumors was assessed.Although both IL1O-armed and unarmed viruses were effectively cleared from animals,greater titers of VVL△TK-IL10 were recovered at days12 and16 compared with VVL△TK in both the transgenic and subcutaneous models of pancreatic cancer,suggesting that IL1O could significantly delay viral clearance.

Given previous reports of the ability of IL1O to stimulate NK cells (17) and as a cytotoxic T-cell differentiation factor (46),we examined reliance of our treatment on these immune subsets. Depletion of NK cells had no effect on treatment efficacy in vivo and we found no evidence of altered splenic or tumor (data not shown） NK populations after treatment with VVL△TK-IL10.In contrast, depletion of $\mathrm { C D 4 } ^ { + }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T-cell populations had a negative impact on treatment efficacy. It has previously been

compared with untreated mice.However,an interesting finding was that the magnitude of the activated splenic $\mathrm { C D 4 } ^ { + }$ and $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ population response in VVL△TK-IL1O treated mice was lower compared with the unarmed virus.This difference correlated with a reduction in virus-specific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ Tcells and IFNy recovery from tumors after VVL△TK-IL1O treatment,which accounted for the delayed viral clearance from tumors.Interestingly，although VVL△TK-IL10 treatment reduced antiviral $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ populations, IL10 had no inhibitory effect on production of antitumor $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells.Indeed,at day 16 after injection,an increase in anti-OVA $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells was observed,which we postulate is a result of the increased oncolysis occurring with VVL△TK-IL1O treatment, which improves TAA release.

These results suggest that IL10 improves the effcacy of OV by modulation of the early immune response to infection,resulting in dampening of antiviral, but not antitumor immunity.However, the mechanism by which IL1O elicits this alteration remains unclear. Our investigations revealed that local IL1O expression results in modification of the tumor macrophage population, which is highly sensitive to IL1O exposure (49).Numerous investigators have reported that IL1O can negatively regulate macrophages by (i) inhibiting their infiltration into tumors,and (ii)

downregulating MHCI expression and suppressing production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive nitrogen oxides (50). Although we found that VVL△TK-IL1O treatment increased macrophage infiltrate into tumors in both the spontaneous and subcutaneous models of pancreatic cancer,we found that in accordance with previous data,VVL△TK-IL1O treatment results ina significant downregulation of MHCII expression. Thus,it is feasible that in our model, tumor macrophages are responsible for viral antigen presentation to T cells and a reduction in macrophage activation by IL1o leads to reduced cross-priming of the antiviral immune response.A further consideration is that this model suggests distinct pathways of viral and tumor antigen presentation,which are the subject of ongoing investigation in our laboratory.

These findings demonstrate that IL1O armed vaccinia virus shows great promise as a novel therapeutic for pancreatic cancer, and that IL10 in combination with oncolytic virotherapy is clearly able to enhance tumor rejection through modulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses.
