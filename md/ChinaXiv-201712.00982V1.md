# INTRODUCTION

Intravitreal(IVT)injectionofanti-vascular endothelialgrowth factor(anti-VEGF） agentshas become the first-line treatment for neovascular retinal diseases,and IVT injection of steroids is also commonly used for treating several eye diseases.It is estimated that nearly 6 million injections will be carried out in the United States in 2016[1].With the establishment and expansion of the procedural standards,IVT injection has been shown to be safe in most cases,but in occasional cases, the patients are still exposed to a cumulative risk ofintraocularnoninfectiouseventsandother complications associated with IVT injectionl².Whether the complications are caused by the drugs injected or by the procedure itself remains unknown. Investigation of the effects of a single IVT injection without drugs on retinal proteomics may both provide valuable insights in understandingtheinjectionprocedure-associated adverse effects and yield important data for optimizing the clinical therapeutic regimen to lower the incidence of the adverse events.Indeed,a recent report has demonstrated that the procedure of a single IVT injection of PBS alone is sufficient to cause substantial reactive changes in Muller cells and microglia involving the entire retina of mice[3].

To explore the subclinical effects of IVT injection on the retina,we analyzed the changes of retinal proteins using tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeling coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry. Such a proteomic study may produce data that enable the identification of theproteins, functionsandpathwayspotentially responsible for the adverse effects of the IVT procedure, other than the drugs injected.

# MATERIALSANDMETHODS

# Animal grouping and treatment

All the experiments were conducted in accordance with the Association ofResearch in Visionand Ophthalmology(ARVO) Statement forthe Useof Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China). Twenty pigmented Chinchila rabbits weighing 2 to $3 ~ \mathrm { k g }$ were kept in an air-conditioned room $( 2 0 - 2 5 ~ \mathrm { ^ circ C } )$ with a 12-hour light-dark cycle and fed with standard laboratory food and water.The rabbits were randomized into 4 groups $\left( n { = } 5 \right)$ ,including a control group (group A) without receiving any injection and 3 IVT injection groups,which received IVT injection of $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ PBS and were sacrificed at 4,7,and 14 days later (groups B, C, and D,respectively).In the latter 3 groups,only the right eye of each rabbit was subjected to IVT injection.

# Intravitreal injection

IVTinjectionwasperformedundersterile conditions.The rabbits were anesthetized with an injection of $3 \%$ pentobarbital sodium solution $( 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g ) }$ via the ear vein.After topical corneal anesthesia with oxybuprocainehydrochlorideeyedrops(Santen Pharmaceutical Co.， Ltd, Osaka, Japan)，a 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe was introduced into the vitreous cavity $3 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ posterior to the limbus.The needle tip was directed towards the center of the vitreous under direct vision.PBS $( 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } )$ was slowly administered into the vitreous.To prevent reflux,the needle was held in place for 3O s before withdrawal.At the end of the procedure,lincomycin eye drops were applied.

# Fundus photography and electroretinography

Fundus photography of the rabbit eye was performed using a digital slit lamp with a 7O-diopter lens (Volk Optical Inc，Ohio,USA）under anesthesia.Electroretinogram (ERG;RetiMINER System,AiErXi Medical Equipment Co.，Ltd.，Chongqing,China) was recorded on days 4,7,and 14 after IVT injection.Briefly,the rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and after the pupils had been dilated,Burian-Allen electrodes (Hansen Laboratory，Iowa City，Iowa) were applied. Theground electrodewasplacedsubcutaneously on the back.Dark- and light-adapted ERGs wererecorded following theproceduredescribed previouslyl4]

# Retinal protein extraction

Retinas were isolated from the eyeballs,frozen in liquid nitrogen,and lysed using a protein extraction buffer $\mathrm { \Delta B \ m o l / L }$ urea, $0 . 1 \%$ SDS) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis,IN,USA) on ice for 30 min.After centrifugation of the lysate at $1 6 \ : 0 0 0 \times _ { g }$ for $1 5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 \ \mathrm { { ^ circ C } }$ ，the supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce,Rockford,IL, USA).

# TMT-labeling and fractionation of labeled peptides

TMT-labeling wasperformed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce).Triethylammonium bicarbonate(TEAB) buffer( $\mathrm { 1 0 0 ~ m m o l / L }$ ）wasadded to the protein solution( $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ total protein） to a final volumeof $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ Fivemicrolitersoftris-(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ）wasadded to the solution,which was incubated at $5 5 \ \mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ Immediately beforeuse，fresh $3 7 5 \mathrm { \ m m o l / L }$ iodoacetamide solution was prepared (by dissolving $9 ~ \mathrm { { m g } }$ iodoacetamide in $1 3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ TEAB) and 5 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ of the iodoacetamide solution was added to the sample and incubated for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ in darkness at room temperature.The proteins were precipitated by prechilled $( - 2 0 \mathrm { ~ \textdegree C }$ ）acetone.After resuspension,the proteins were digested overnight at $3 7 \ \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } }$ with $2 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ of trypsin. One tube of TMT1O label reagent was added to each $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ sample,and the reaction was carried out at room temperature for $^ { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ } }$ .The labeling reaction was quenched by adding $8 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $5 \%$ hydroxylamine.After labeling,the samples from 3 retinas in each group were mixed for measurement.

Forfractionation of the labeled peptides，the samples were first lyophilized and reconstituted in solvent A( $2 \%$ ACN，pH1O).The samples were then loaded onto Xbridge PST C18 column $( 1 3 0 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ } , \mathrm { ~ 5 ~ \mu m }$ $2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m m } \times 4 . 6$ mm column;Waters,Milford,MA,USA) and resolved by basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) using a gradient of $5 \%$ to $9 5 \%$ solvent B( $90 \%$ ACN,pH10) in $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .A total of 40 fractions were collected, which were concatenated to 2O fractions, vacuum dried and stored at $- 8 0 \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } }$ until analysis.

# Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was carried out by Capitalbio Technology with a Q Exactive MassSpectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The peptide mixture was separated by reversed phase chromatography on a DIONEX nano-UPLC system using an Acclaim C18 PepMaplOO nano-Trap column( $7 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { m } \times 2$ cm） connected to an Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column ( $7 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } } \times 2 5$ cm,particle size of $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ；Thermo Scientific).Before loading, the sample was dissolved in a buffer containing $4 \%$ acetonitrile and $0 . 1 \%$ formic acid.A linear gradient of mobile phase B $( 0 . 1 \%$ formic acid in $9 9 . 9 \%$ acetonitrile） from $2 \%$ to $3 5 \%$ in $4 5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ was used followed by a steep increase to $80 \%$ mobile phase B in $1 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at a flow rate of $3 0 0 \mathrm { \ n L / m i n }$ .The nano-LC was coupled online with the Q Exactive mass spectrometer using a stainless steel emitter coupled to a nanospray ion source.

Massspectrometry analysis was performed in a data-dependent manner with full scans $( 3 0 0 - 1 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m / z } )$ acquired using an Orbitrap mass analyzer at a mass resolution of $7 0 ~ 0 0 0$ at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m / z }$ in Q Exactive.Twenty most intense precursor ions from a survey scan were selected for MS/MS from each duty cycle and detected at a mass resolution of $3 5 \ 0 0 0$ at $\mathrm { m / z }$ of 400 in Orbitrap analyzer.All the tandem mass spectra were produced by higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD） method. Dynamic exclusion was set for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { s }$ ：

# Analysis of enriched pathway

Enrichedpathwayswereanalyzedwiththe command-line program KOBAS 2.0.We used the whole genome as the default background distributionto identify the significantly enriched pathways in a set of sequences.For each pathway that occurred in the set of genes,we counted the total number of genes involved in theset. Wecalculatedthe $p$ valueusinga hypergeometric distribution.If a whole genome has $N$ total genes,among which $M$ are involved in the pathway under investigation,and the set of genes has $n$ total genes,among which $m$ are involved in the same pathway,the $P$ value for the pathway was calculated as below:

$$
p = 1 - \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { m - 1 } { \frac { { \binom { m } { i } } { \binom { N - M } { n - i } } } { \binom { N } { n } } }
$$

Because a large number of KEGG pathways are considered, multiple hypotheses tests are performed. To reduce the type-1 errors (i.e.false positive discoveries), we performed an FDR correction with a default cutoff of 0.05.

# Analysis of protein-protein interactions

Protein-protein interactions were analyzed using the web-based bioinformatic search software STRING (version9.1). STRINGcontainsadatabaseof interactions for known or predicted proteins including physical and functional associations from genomic contexts，high-throughputexperiments，coexpression and previous knowledge. The significantly changed proteins were entered into STRING for analyzing the protein interactions.The background set was the full Oryctolagus proteome.

# Data analysis

Proteome Discoverer software (Ver. 1.4,Thermo Scientific) was used to perform database searching against the Oryctolagus Cuniculus database (46551 proteins) using the Sequest algorithms.The following settings were used: precursor mass tolerance of $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / }$ ${ \mathrm { k g } } ,$ and fragment mass tolerance of O.O2 Da. Trypsin was specified asthe digesting enzyme and 2 missed cleavages were allowed.Cysteine carbamidomethylation and TMT modifications (N-terminus and lysine residues) were defined as fixed modifications and methionine oxidation was defined as variable modifications.The resultswere filtered byincluding only the highly confident peptides with a global $\mathrm { F D R } { < } 1 \%$ based on a target-decoyapproach.IntheTMT quantitation workflow the most confident centroid method was used with an integration window of $2 0 \mathrm { \ m g / k g }$ ，For protein quantification,only unique peptides were used.

# Statistical analysis

Statisticalanalysiswasperformedusingthe GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism 5, Inc.,San Diego, CA，USA). The results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.A $P$ value less than O.O5 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

# RESULTS

# Ophthalmic and ERGexaminations

Before and after IVT injection,fundus and ERG examinationswereperformed. Fundusphotography detected no distinct changes in the eyes after injection as compared to the untreated control eyes (Fig.1).Fig.2 showstherepresentativeERGresponsesand amplitude-intensity profiles of the untreated control and the PBS-injected eyes.The ERG waveforms and the amplitudes of the averaged a- and b-wave recorded under various stimuli in the PBS-injected groups were similar with those obtained in the control groups ( $P >$ $0 . 0 5 , n = 5 \cdot$ ）

# Protein profile

The proteins identified from rabbit retinas had a wide range of relative molecular masses (from 4OOO to $1 ~ 0 0 0 ~ 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { D a }$ ).Most of proteins had a $p I$ between 4 and 12.To improvethe analyticalprecision， all the quantitative data related to a certain peptide that was identified in multiple fractions were used for deriving the protein quantification tables.We obtained a total of 6042 proteins from the rabbit retinas.Among them,155 differentiallyexpressedproteins(DEPs)fromthe injected eyes were up-regulated by more than 2 folds or down-regulated by over $5 0 \%$ relative to the control. These DEPs included 19 proteins up-regulated by over 5 folds (Tab.1),14 down-regulated by over $80 \%$ (Tab.2), and 16 with inconsistent changes at different time points (Tab.3).

# Proteomics quantification analysis

Among the 6O42 proteins,actin，alpha cardiac muscle 1 was the most prominently up-regulated protein (by 36.91 folds) in the retina at 7 days after IVT injection ofPBS,followed by lactotransferrinand sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 1, which were up-regulated by over 1O folds at days 4 and 7(Tab.1).The most distinctly down-regulated protein wascarbonylreductase[NADPH]3, whichwas expressed at only $9 \%$ of the control level at day 14 after the injection (Tab.2).

# Functional enriched pathway ofDEP

To better understand the functions of the DEPs, we performed pathway analysis using KOBAS 2.O software based on KEGG database.Twenty significantly enriched pathway terms are shown in Fig.3.KEGG analysis indicated that the DEPs were involved in pathways of glycan degradation，focal adhesion，cytosolic DNAsensing pathway,arginine and proline metabolism, tight junction,riboflavin metabolism，RIG-I-likereceptor signalingpathway，ECM-receptor interaction,steroid biosynthesis， steroid biosynthesis， glycosaminoglycan degradation，glycerophospholipid metabolism，protein digestionandabsorption,regulationofactin cytoskeleton，PI3K-Akt signaling pathway，lysosome, leukocytetransendothelialmigration,and SNARE interactions in vesicular transport.

# Functional network ofDEPs

Through the protein-protein interaction network, we identified the proteins involved in the biological processes including signal transduction，regulation of gene expression,energy and material metabolism,and cell cycle regulation.Analysis against BioGrid database showed the interactions between the DEPs (Fig.4). Using functional network diagram analysis,we found that 46 proteinswere involved in functional and physical connections.In this network,DEPs and onestep interacting proteins were represented as nodes,and the biological relationship between two nodeswas represented as an edge.The size of the node is proportional to the degree of association: the more edges are connected to the node,the greater the degree of association,and the bigger the size of the node.The color of the node,from green to red,corresponds to the value of the clustering coeffcient gradient (from low to high) that indicates the connectivity between the nodes. The diagram in Fig.4 highlights 46 nodes and 74 edges, forming 53 DEP-DEP pairs.ISG15 and ACTC1 are two genesencodingubiquitin-likeproteinISG15and actin,alpha cardiac muscle1,respectively,to which 13 and 9 one-step interacting proteins are connected, respectively.Among the one-step proteins connected to actin，alpha cardiac muscle 1,tropomyosin alpha-1 chain,tropomyosin 2 (beta) and alpha-actinin-2 interact with each other directly and form a triangle interaction network.

# DISCUSSION

In this study，TMT-labeled proteomic technology wasused to analyze the alterations of the retinal proteins afterIVT injection of PBS in rabbits.Due to its fast separation,high sensitivity and high resolution,this technique has become a powerful method to identify the DEPs with a large coverage of the proteome.To our knowledge,the current study represents the first attempt to apply this method in the exploration of DEPs in the retina following IVT injection.Although our proteomic analysis was based on a database of rabbit proteins,it mayhelp in better understanding retinal protein alternations after IVT injection and in discovering the proteins that are specifically associated with the IVT procedure.The differential expression of retinal proteins following IVT injection are probably related with the retinal wound induced by the needle puncture,PBS injected,or a transient elevation of the intraocular pressure,all of which are inevitable consequences after an IVT injection.

Our analysis identified a total of 6O42 proteins in the retina,and among them 49 proteins $( 0 . 8 1 \% )$ were up-regulated by over 5.O folds or down-regulated by over $80 \%$ (with a probability greater than $9 5 . 0 \%$ ）at 4,7 or 14 days after IVT injection of PBS.The most striking DEPs caused by IVT injection were associated with cytoskeleton alterations.Cytoskeleton plays a vital role in sustaining the growth,maturation,differentiation,and integrity of cells in the eye[5].Among the cytoskeletonrelated proteins,actin,alpha cardiac muscle 1 was the mostremarkablychangedprotein， andprotein interaction network analysis indicated a central role for ACTC1 gene,which encodes this protein.

Thesignaling pathway of focal adhesion was altered in the injected eyes.Proteins involved in focal adhesion included collagen alpha-1(XI) chain isoform X1，vascular endothelial growth factor receptor1, integrin alpha-11,myosin regulatory light chain 2, skeletal muscle isoform type 2 and alpha-actinin-2, among which collagen alpha-1(XI) chain isoform X1 and integrin alpha-11 were also involved in extracellular matrix(ECM)-receptorinteractionpathway.Focal adhesions arelarge macromolecularassembliesthat function as signal carriers by delivering messages to the cellsand subsequently affect the cell behaviors [6]. Connection between focal adhesions and proteins of the ECM generally involves integrins. Composed of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits,integrinsaretransmembrane heterodimers that transmit signals from the ECM to the cells 7. 8] and mediate stable adhesion of cells to their substrate[9]. More importantly, integrins trigger signaling cascades from the ECM into the cell to control crucial cellularfunctionsincludingcell.differentiation, proliferatio,survivalandmigration[oIntheeye,the ECMprovidesa framework for retinal cells，and adhesion junctions connect the cells via the core components including actin[12]. Clustering and activation of integrins and actin complexes initiate this framework forcell signaling[13].In our study,down-regulation of integrin alpha-11 was detected at all the 3 time points in the injected eyes,indicating functional disorder of cell adhesionsand potential defects in the morphology, migration and differentiation of retinal cells.In addition, IVT injection also up-regulated the tight junction pathway,which was modulated by a variety of cellular and metabolic regulators [14]．We noted an evident increase of alpha-actinin-2,which is involved in both focal adhesion signaling and tight junction pathways and plays a key role in controlling integrin activation and its binding to cytoskeleton within the cell[15l.

Wealso identified changes in riboflavin (RF) metabolism in the retina following IVT injection.IVT injection down-regulated the expression of riboflavin kinase (RFK) in the retina. RF(known also as watersoluble vitamin B2) is vital in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of theocularsurface [16], photoreceptors and lens[i7.18].RF is transformed into its active coenzyme derivatives by phosphorylation of an ATP:riboflavin kinase,which catalyses RF into flavin mononucleotide(FMN), andthelatter was further catalyzed into flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) by FADsynthetase (FADS)[19]. FMN and FAD are two essential cofactors for numerous enzymes contributing to the transfer of electrons in oxido-reduction processes critical to the major metabolic energy transformation routes[2o. 21].FAD also mediates the regeneration of reduced glutathione,which is the major regulator of the intracellular thiol redox status and effectively scavenges free radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2]. The down-regulation of RFK,which is a crucial point of RF transformation into FMN and FAD and a key step in the biological oxidation-reduction reactions,implies that this metabolic pathway is affected after IVT injection.

The level of lactotransferrin (LF） increased by nearly 11 folds at day 4 after IVT injection.LF is an important component in the host defense system in ocular tissues[231.It is associated with therapeutic effects by promoting corneal wound healing,restoring loss of corneal epithelial integrity and reducing chorioretinal damage24-7]，andisrelatedwithprotectionagainst infection,tumorand_inflammation in the_eye [28，29]. Elevation of retinal LF in eyes following IVT injection seems to imply the activation of the local protective mechanismin the retina.

Our data did not show any changes of inflammatory cytokines or chemokines in PBS-injected eyes,but we detected an increase in the expression of caspase-9 in the retina by 1.9 and 3.82 folds at days 7 and14 after the injection，respectively.Caspase-9 is an initiator caspase activated by apoptosome during programmed cell death[30.31l.We also noted a remarkable increase of NF-kappa-B inhibitor zeta isoform X2,but its exact role in the process of inflammation and apoptosis is yet unclear. Previous studies have identified it asan atypical nuclear member of the IkB family with dual functionsinpositiveandnegativeregulationof NF- $\kappa \mathrm { B }$ -mediated transcription[32-34].

In conclusion,we found significant alternations in the expression profiles of retinal proteins associated with cell adhesion，morphology，migration，differentiation, signal transduction and riboflavin metabolism in rabbit eyes after IVT PBS injection.Although these changes did not appear to be suficient to cause tangible bodily signs,they testify the fact that IVT injection is at least capable of causing retinal changes at the protein level.
