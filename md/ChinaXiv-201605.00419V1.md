# An exon skipping in a SEPALLATA-Like gene is associated with perturbed floral and fruits development in cucumber

SummaryWe isolated a mutant showing perturbations in the development of male and female floral organs and fruits. Analysis of the single nucleotide polymorphisms from bulked $\mathsf { F } _ { 2 }$ pools identified the causative variant occurring in Csa4G126690. Csa4G126690 shows high homolOgy to Arabidopsis SEPALLATA2 (SEP2) thus being designated CsSEP2. The causative variant was located on the splicing site of $\mathsf { C s S E P 2 }$ , resulting in the skipping of exon 6 and abolishment of the transcriptional activity. Our data suggest that CsSEP2 is involved in the floral organ and fruits development by conferring transcriptional activity.

In flowering plants,floral development represents a significant diversion from vegetative growth and is of closely relevant to the yield of plants.The majority of flowering plants produce bisexual flowers with female and male organs on the same plants,while the separation of female and male organs occurs on the same individual for monoecious species and on different plants for dioecious species.Arabidopsis thaliana is a model species for bisexual plants,and the ABCE model has been proposed as a key principle to decipher the molecular mechanism of floral specification.According to this model, $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { E }$ genes are needed for sepal, $\mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B } + \mathsf { E }$ for petal, $\mathsf { B } + \mathsf { C } + \mathsf { E }$ for stamen,and $C + E$ genes for carpel (Bowman et al. 1989，1991; Jack et al. 1992; Goto and Meyerowitz 1994; Weigel and Meyerowitz 1994; Riechmann et al. 1996; Pelaz et al. 20oo; Ditta et al. 2004; Sridhar et al. 2006). Most of ABCE genes encode MADS-box proteins,suggesting that the MADS-box genes are essential for flower development.

Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely cultivated vegetable crop,and a typical monoecious species with unisexual flowers on the same individual.The formation of unisexual flowers results from the selective arrest of the development of either staminate or pistillate primordia just after the bisexual stage (Malepszy and Niemirowicz-Szczytt 1991; Kater et al.2oo1).Two sets of genes are involved in the process of floral development.One set of genes promotes the accurate formation of all organs necessary fora normal flower.The other set of genes determines the sex identity ofa flower.At present most studies focus on the isolation of genes responsibleforsexdetermination(Malepszyand Niemirowicz-Szczytt 1991; Li et al. 2012； Boualem et al. 2015)，few studies has been performed to investigate the genes involved in the ABCE model in monoecious plants with unisexual flowers on the same individual (Kater et al.2001).

In this study,we isolated a floral mutant through an ethyl methane sulfonate(EMS) screening in the cucumber inbred line 4o6 background.Compared with the wild-type plants, the mutant produced enormously large sepals in both female and male flowers (Figure1A). In normal female flowers three lobes of the stigma were observed，whereas in mutant female flowers three lobes of the stigma became irregularly shaped and were not easily recognized,and the style was nearly three-fold longer than the normal ones (Figure 1B).The male flowers in the mutant were also considerably different and larger than that in the normal plants.In the mutants,the filaments cannot come together,and the inner cavity became filled with a style-like tissue (Figure 1C).We also observed defective fruits in the mutants,as the fruits just grew up to $5 c m$ and then shed from its peduncle (Figure 1D).To characterize the floral phenotype of the mutant in depth, we conducted microscopic observation of flowers at different development stages (Figure 2A-V). The cucumber floral development has been classified into 12 stages from meristem initiation (stage 1) to anthesis (stage 12),and at stage 6 the male and female flower buds is morphologically distinguishable (Bai et al.2oo4).Our results showed no significant difference from stage 1 to stage7in both male and female flowers,while at stage 8 morphological differences were visible.Therefore,the abnormal development is likely to occur between stage 7 and stage 8.At stage 8,the pronounced difference was that the carpel primordial elongated in female and male flowers of the mutant plants.

Phenotypic evaluation of a $\mathsf { F } _ { 2 }$ population derived from a cross between the male mutant and female wild-type plants showed 44 plants bearing aberrant flowers and 182 plants bearing normal flowers.Through $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test,we found that the observed segregation ratio fitted with 3:1( $\mathsf { P } = 0 . 0 5 4 8 )$ indicating that the aberrant floral trait was dominated by a recessive gene.

To identify the variant associated with the phenotype, whole genome re-sequencing was carried out for three pools of DNA,including M pool from 16 $\mathsf { F } _ { 2 }$ mutant individuals,W pool from 16 $\mathsf { F } _ { 2 }$ wild-type plants,and 4o6 pool from 2o background plants.The resultant sequencing data of the three pools were aligned against the cucumber reference genome 993o (Huang et al.2oo9),and the nucleotide sequence was generated for each pool. As a result,223,473 raw SNP loci for W pool and 229,524 for M pool were extracted for further analyses. Respective 80,960 $( 3 6 . 2 \% )$ and 72,325 (31.5%) SNPs in W pool and M pool were eliminated through the filtering process.The remaining SNPs from each pool were put together and created a union set consisting of $^ { 1 7 6 , 8 7 8 }$ loci. It was expected that the SNP responsible for the recessive phenotype was homozygous in M and 4o6 pools and heterozygous in W pool. We found 1,153 such SNPs，and then the ones differing between M and 4o6 pools were retained.Considering the preferential mutations caused by EMS mutagenesis (Drake and Baltz1976),3o SNPs exhibiting G to A or C to Tmutation were finally kept (Table S1).Among 3o SNPs across seven chromosomes,23 were located in intergenic regions,while only seven SNPs were located in genic regions (Figure 3A).

Among seven SNPs,two occurred in the intronic regions on chromosome 6.The remaining five SNPs resided on chromosome 4; three of them occurred in intronic regions，and SNP4G12697245 caused nonsynonymous mutation and SNP4G7741482 was present on a splicing site.Amplification of SNP4G12697245 (Table S2）and its flanking region from six mutant individuals of M pool showed that this SNP was heterozygous,so it was excluded for further analysis.A dCAPs marker (Table S2) based on SNP4G7741482 was tested in the F2 population consisting of 213 individuals，to determine the association between the variantand the mutant phenotype.The result showed that SNP4G7741482 completely co-segregated with the phenotype.Based on the facts that analysis of the re-sequencing data delimited the causative SNPs to seven ones and SNP4G7741482 was the only one completely co-segregating with the phenotype,we concluded that SNP4G7741482 was the causative SNP and Csa4G12699o was the candidate gene.

In Arabidopsis,four SEPALLATA (SEP) genes are E class genes and required for the specification of floral organs. BLAST search showed that Csa4G12699o exhibited highest homology to SEP2 in Arabidopsis,so it was designated CsSEP2 hereafter.Alignment of CsSEP2with putative SEP genes from different species showed that CsSEP2 lacked the entire

MADS-box domain (data not shown)，an indispensable domain for SEP genes.We examined the RNA-seq data of a previously sequenced cucumber line 993o (Huang et al.2009; Li et al.2o11),finding that there were still reads beyond the end of the annotated CsSEP2 (Figure S1).Those reads supported an extra exon with a length of 185bp at the $5 ^ { \prime }$ end and a start codon was predicted in the extra exon(Figures 3B,S1A).Together with a single base pair just before the previously annotated start codon (Figure S1B),the extra sequence can be translated into a peptide consisting of 62 amino acids and this short peptide was predicted to contain a MADS-box domain coincidentally.Sequencing of the CsSEP2 transcripts from wild type plants verified the gene structure of CsSEP2 (Table S2). SNP4G7741482 was present on the $5 ^ { \prime }$ end of intron 6 (splice donor site),and sequencing of the mutated CsSEP2 revealed that the whole exon 6 (42 bp) was missing without a frameshift mutation (Figure 3C). Examination of the transcriptomicdata of 993o revealed that CsSEP2 hasa flowerspecific expression pattern (Li et al. 2011).

The Arabidopsis SEP3 has been demonstrated to mediate the interaction between MADS-box proteins by supplying transcriptional activation (Honma and Goto 2oo1).We performed an assay to test whether the exon skipping event affected the transcriptional activity of CsSEP2.The yeast transformed by the construct containing the coding region ofwild type CsSEP2 grew on the SD/-Trp/-His/-Ade plates,in contrast,the yeast transformed by the construct containing the coding region ofmutant CsSEP2 could not grow(Figure 3D; Table S2).These results indicated that the exon skipping event originating from the SNP on the splicing site abolished the transcriptional activity of CsSEP2.

Mutants are valuable sources to uncover the gene for a traitof interest,and theutilization ofadvanced analysis tools expedites the process.In this study，we applied modified MutMap (Abe et al.2o12) to localize the gene controlling the phenotype.Analysis of the SNPs from three bulks identified the causative variant occurring in CsSEP2.In the mutant,exon 6 was spliced out because of the presence of a SNP on the splicing site of exon 6.The RNA splicing mechanisms involving the splicesome consisting of five uridine-rich small ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs) have been elucidated (Staley and Guthrie 1998;Wahl et al. 2009). In the case of CsSEP2, snRNP U2 bound to $5 ^ { \prime }$ end of exon 6 searches for the adjacent snRNPU1 which was supposed to bound to $3 ^ { \prime }$ end of exon 6, however， snRNP U1 could not recognize $3 ^ { \prime }$ end of exon 6 owning to the mutation.Thereby snRNPU2 may interactwith snRNP U1 bound to $3 ^ { \prime }$ end of exon 7,which would produce an exon (exon $^ { 6 + }$ intermediate intron $+$ exon 7) longer than the definedexon ( $: < 3 0 0$ bp) (De Conti et al.2013), therefore the splicesome tends to skip the exon 6 to create a short mRNA.

Using corrected CsSEP2 amino acid sequence as a query to perform BLAST against cucumber genome， two genes, Csa6Go95270 and Csa1G039900，with homology to CsSEP2 were found.Similar to the case of CsSEP2, these two genes were also erroneously annotated in 993o and lacked the MADS-box domain.We corrected the nucleotide sequences of these two genes in the same manner as for CsSEP2.Alignment of these three putative SEP genes showed $4 9 . 8 \%$ identity, whereas four SEP genes in Arabidopsis showed $4 1 . 2 \%$ identity (Figure S2).In Arabidopsis,disruption ofa single SEP caused only subtle phenotype (Pelaz et al.2ooo; Ditta et al. 2o04),as opposed to the severe perturbation of floral development in cucumber by mutation of asingle CsSEP2.Why CsSEP2 plays suchan important role merits further investigation.

The SEP genes play a broad and crucial role in flower developmentin Arabidopsis.The primaryrole ofSEP proteins seems to provide a scaffold for the formation of transcription complexes and convey upon these complexes transcriptional activation potential (Goto et al. 2oo1; Honma and Goto 2001). In this study,we found that the exon skipping event abolished the transcriptional activity of CsSEP2 (Figure 3D),which means that the primary role of CsSEP2 was severely disrupted and suggests that the complexes of MADS-box proteins could not execute their proper functions.Since pollen from the mutant can be used for crossing,the stamen may generally function as normal ones although it possesses considerable morphological variation.Petals in mutant plants appeared the same as in wild type plants.In contrast， the sepal and stigma were considerably different from normal ones.These morphological observations led us to speculate that the interaction between malfunctional CsSEP2and other MADS-box proteins maybe disproportionatelyaffected.It has been proposed that tomato SEPALLATA homologs,TM5 and TM29 play a role in fruit development (Pnueli et al. 1994; Ampomah-Dwamena et al.2oo2).We observed that fruits of the mutant cannot elongate,suggesting that CsSEP2 may also function in fruit development (Pnueli et al. 1994; Ampomah-Dwamena et al. 2002).Further studies identifying CsSEP2-interacting genes and investigating the influence of the exon skipping event on interactions will help unravel the mechanisms controlling floral and fruits development in unisexual plants.
