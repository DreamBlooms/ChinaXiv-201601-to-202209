# ABSTRACT

Engineered pillars,pits and grooves spaced3,6,9 and $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart were fabricated on siloxane modified acrylic resin films.The efectoffeature size,geometry,and wettability on the settlementof diferent algae was evaluated.These films showed various antifouling performances to Ulothrix,Closterium and Navicula.For Navicula (length: $1 0 { - } 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m } ^ { \cdot }$ ),the feature size and geometry displayed a substantial correlation with the antifouling properties.The film with pillars spaced $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ reduced Navicula settlement by $73 \%$ compared to the control surface.For Closterium (length: $4 5 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ),their responses were governed by the same underlying thermodynamic principles as wettability,the largest reduction in Closterium, $81 \%$ Was obtained on the surface with grooves spaced $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart.For Ulothrix (length: $5 { - } 8 \mathrm { m m }$ ),thesurface also showed the best antifouling performance,the reduction ratio of the settement on the surface with grooves spaced $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart could even reach $9 2 \%$ .Atlast,physical fouling deterrent mechanisms for the films with various textures were analyzed in detail.The feature size and geometry display a substantial correlation with the antifouling properties when the sizeoffouling algae is close to the textures.With the increasing size for algae,antifouling performance was getting better on surface with pillars or grooves because the algae are bridged between two or more features other than stabilizing its entire mass on one single feature or able to settle between features.

# 1.Introduction

Biofouling is generally defined as the accumulation of living organisms including microorganisms,algae and animals on asurface immersed in seawater.This undesirable colonization has serious impacts that can be environmental,economic,or ecological-related[1-3]. Biofouling is of great concern in numerous applications ranging from biosensors to industrial and marine equipment.The self-polishing coatings are effective on reducing biofouling because of slow release of tin,copper or other toxins in time [4-6].But they had detrimental impact on nature [7-9]. In order to protect our nature, the development of non-toxic and environment-friendly anti-fouling paints is the main trend of marine antifouling coatings.The ideal coating should be also with antifouling and foul releasing properties.

Poly(dimethysiloxane）(PDMS） or silicone materials have demonstrated good fouling-release (FR) performance under suitable hydrodynamic conditions,and they are considered non-toxic marine coatings [1O-13].But,PDMS has some obvious drawbacks, suchas poor adhesion with substrate,low mechanical strength and high cost.The siloxane modified acrylic resin(SMAR),also has good fouling-release(FR)performance,and its mechanical properties are better than silicone[14].But,the SMAR is not inherently antifouling like other low surface energy antifouling paints.Biofouling will occur under low flow conditions.

Shark,mollusk shellsand othermarine animals show excellent antifouling performance on their skins because their surfaces display special micro/nano binary textures.Inspired by the interesting phenomena,the materials with micro/nano-textures on the surface might also demonstrate the excellent anti-fouling performance. Carman etal. presented a biomimetically inspired surface topography(Sharklet AFTM),which had feature dimensions smaller than the spore body,significantly reduced settlement density by $8 6 \%$ relative to smooth PDMS [15].And they suggested that spores' responses were governed by the same underlying thermodynamic principlesas wettability.Results from Schumacher indicated that engineered microtopographies reduced Ulva spores settlement by up to $5 8 \%$ (diameter circular pillars and $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ equilateral triangles）and by $7 7 \%$ formicrotopographies replicating shark skin [16].An indirect correlation between spore settlement and a newly described engineered roughness index was identified in this research.

Previous results evaluated the effect of topographic feature size,geometry,wettability and roughness on settlement of Ulva zoospores,but it was necessary to address algae size in relation of attachment.All of these factors were important for the anti-fouling properties.Static bioassays were conducted on microtextured polyimide surfaces using four diatom species,Fallaciacarpentariae, Nitzschia cf.paleacea,Amphora sp.and Navicula jeffreyi with cell sizesranging from $1 { - } 1 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .Theirworkdirectly testedattachment ‘point theory'and preliminarily revealed the effect of cell sizes on anti-fouling properties [17].To the best of our knowledge,the relationship between algae size and texture geometry have not been reported in detail until now.

In this paper,taking advantage of low surface energy and surface textures,SMAR filmswith various texturesare prepared.Three kinds of common algae including Ulothrix,Closterium and Navicula are used to evaluate the biofouling resistance properties of as-prepared samples.Systematic investigation of surface topography,wet/dewettability,anti-fouling performances are performed by corresponding equipments.The anti-fouling mechanisms of textured coatings are analyzed based on the three key factors including of surface wettability,morphology (feature size and spacing),and algae size.

# 2.Experimental

# 2.1.Materials

The polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) elastomer(SILASTIC DC-184, Dow Corning Corporation) was used as the masterplate material for texture formation due to its high reproducibility and good elasticity.The elastomer was prepared by hand mixing ten parts by weight ofPDMS prepolymer with one partby weight of curing agent.The mixture was degassed at ambient temperature for $9 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ，then typicallycured at $7 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$

The base material for topographical modification used in thisstudy was siloxane modified acrylic resin (SMAR)(SKD002, Shanghai Chaoyu Corporation).Six parts of SMAR and two parts of hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer(CORONATE HX,NPU Corporation）were dissolved in three parts of xylene by weight.The mixture was degassed for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and allowed to be cured at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$

# 2.2. Surfaces

The method used to fabricate various surface textures is simpleand reproducible.The schematic process flow to create pillars, pits and groove with different area density was shown in Fig.1. The texture was initially etched in silicon wafers using the inductively coupled plasma etching process as previously described by McAuley[18].The above PDMS mixture was degassed at room temperature forabout $1 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ to remove any air bubbles in the mixture. The PDMS mixture was spin-coated on the wafers,then heat treated at $7 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ in a vacuum oven.Negative texture was replicated directly from the etched wafer.The PDMS elastomer with negative texture was used to produce a positive replica in SMAR.At last, the above SMAR mixture was degassedat room temperature forabout $0 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ to remove bubbles.The SMAR mixture was spin-coated on the textured PDMS elastomer,after being heat treated at $7 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ the positive textures were transferred to SMAR from the negative textures.

Surface textures included circular pillars,continuous grooves, and circular pits.Their diameter or width was $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .Pillars,pits and grooveswere spaced3,6,9 and $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart (Fig.2). Control surfaces were uniformly smooth.

# 2.3.Contact angle measurements

The static water contactangles of the free-standing SMAR films with textures were measured according to the sessile droplet method usinga drop shape analysis system (Data Physics OCA20, Germany） with a computer-controlled liquid dispensing system. Deionized water droplet with a volume of $4 \mu \mathrm { L }$ was employed as the source for the measurements.The contact angle was the average of three replicates for each textured sample,and each sample's contactanglewastestedthree times.

# 2.4.Algae settlement assay

SMAR samples containing $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ diameter circular pillars,pits and $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ width continuous grooves,spaced 3,6,9 and $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart were evaluated for settlement of algae.Three replicates of each textured type were tested as films pasted on glass slides (size: $7 6 \mathrm { m m } \times 2 5 \mathrm { m m }$ ).Auniformly smooth SMAR film wasused in the assayand served asa control for direct comparison.

Thethree algae speciesused,Ulothrix,Closteriumand Navicula wereall harvested from the East China Sea.The length of Ulothrix, Closterium and Navicula was,in order, $5 { - } 8 \mathrm { m m }$ ， $4 5 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and $1 0 { - } 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,respectively;the width of three algae species was all $3 { - } 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ Growth conditions for all algae were $1 2 { : } 1 2 \mathrm { h }$ light:dark cycle at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ 、Closterium and Navicula were supplemented with Guillard's $\mathrm { F } / 2$ medium,Ulothrix was supplemented with Selenite Enrichment(SE) medium.

The glass slides with films were placed on sample holder which was immersed in the bottom of the beaker filled with $1 5 \mathrm { m L }$ filtered seawater and $1 5 \mathrm { m L }$ of algae culture suspension. The density of the Closterium and Navicula culture suspension was $\displaystyle { 1 { - } 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { c e l l s m L ^ { - 1 } } }$ . The chlorophyll value of Ulothrix culture suspension was 1.5547 $( \mu \mathrm { g c m } ^ { - 2 }$ )

Then,the algae were left to be settled for7 days.The filmsafter algaesettlement were rinsed by dipping ina new beaker of filtered seawater three times to remove unattached algae.

The films settled by Closteriumand Navicula were fixed with $2 \%$ glutaraldehyde in artificial seawateras described by Callow[19]. Closterium and Navicula counts were quantified using a Dimension 3100v Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope(LSCM) analysis system. Ten imagesand counts were obtained from 1O random fields of viewper $0 . 6 4 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ area for Closteriumand $0 . 1 6 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ area for Navicula.The settlement of Ulothrix on the films was determined by chlorophyll valuesbyusinga Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer.

Every textured film'santifouling property was evaluated by the reduction ratio $\left( R _ { \mathrm { r } } \right)$ of algae density compared to the control film.

$$
R _ { \mathrm { r } } = { \frac { ( D _ { \mathrm { c } } - D _ { \mathrm { n } } ) } { D _ { \mathrm { c } } } }
$$

$D _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ ,the algae density of the textured film; $D _ { \mathsf { c } }$ ,thealgae density of the control film;when the algae density of textured film was higher than control surface, the $R _ { \mathrm { r } }$ then was a negative value.

# 3.Resultsanddiscussion

Understanding the role of surface textures in deterring different organismsis important in terms of optimizing the performance of coatings designed to prevent or reduce biofouling.The SMAR base material was chosen due to its excellent mechanical properties compared to fouling-release coatings.The regular pillars,pits and grooves were chosen as models in order to reveal the deep mechanism that can be used to inform further designs aimed at reducing biofouling.Threealgae,Ulothrix,Closteriumand Navicula, which were different in size,were used to reveal the relationship between algae size and texture geometry in detail.

Every textured film's antifouling property was evaluated by the reduction ratio of the settlement compared to the control film.

The Navicula used in this study were able to settle,glide and attach to surface in static bioassays.The size of Navicula was $1 0 { - } 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,which was similar to that of textures.For the surfaces with pillars,thelowest mean Navicula density was found on the surface with a distance of $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ between adjacent pillars.This surface showed a significant reduction ratio which was $73 \%$ compared to the control surface.As the distance of pillars increased, the reduction rate tended to be reduced.When the distance of the pillars was $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ Navicula settlementwas even more serious,which was 2.25 times than that of the control surface.For the surfaces with pits spaced3,6,9 and $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart, the settlement was all lower than control surface.And with the decrease of distance betweenadjacent pits,the settlement reduction rate compared to the control surface tends to be increased.When the distance of the pits was $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,the reduction ratio could even reach $60 \%$ .The settlement on the surface with groove spaced $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart did not change significantly compared to control surface.And higher numbers of Navicula attached to the surface with groove spaced 3,6 and ${ \mathfrak { s } } { \mathfrak { \mu } } { \mathfrak { m } }$ apart compared to control surface (Fig.3a).

![](images/2164363e5d3f4107a6f13acc5127ec6b703bcd4420ff1567587aa4c281ab88be.jpg)  
Figvi grooves.

On the surface with pillars spaced $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,the Navicula(the length is $1 0 { - } 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m } \dot { }$ was too large to rest between or on top of the pillars, most of them must bridge (Fig.3a).Bridging which reduced the contact area between the Navicula and surface,would reduce the overall adhesion strength.So the lowest mean Navicula density was displayed on the pillars surface witha distance of $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ between adjacent pillars.With the distance of pillars increased,the probability of Navicula settling on the area(Fig.3b) between the pillars tended to be increased.When the distance of pillars was $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ the area between adjacent pillars was $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m } \times 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,the size of the Navicula body are ideally suited to settlement on the scale of micrometers.So the number of Navicula was the maximum on the textured surface with the largest distance betweenadjacent pillars (2.25 times that of the control surface).

For the surfaces with pits,the diameter size of pits was $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ circular.When Navicula attached on the pits,it was too small to fit the Navicula entire mass and some parts of body without being in physical contact with the surface.This case would also reduce the overall adhesion areaand strength.So for the surfaces with pits,the settlement were all lower than control surface,and the settlement reduction rate compared to the control surface tends to increase as the distance of pits decreases.

On the surface with grooves,a higher number of spores consistently attached to the surface with valleys than on controls and a majority of spores settled on the angle between the valley floor and sidewall. Swimming spores possessed the ability of sensing an energetically favorable place for settlement has been noted previously[2O].And recent research [21] indicated that spores of Ulva settled preferentiallyin $5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ valleys,the same sizeas the spores. In this study, the width of continuous groove was $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,similar to the width of Navicula $( 3 - 4 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ .The groove can provide a suitable place for Navicula settling.By observing Navicula's attachment to the surfaceswith grooves,itwas found that most of Navicula lined up longitudinally inside the grooves (Fig.3c),and their entire mass was glued to groove floor and sidewall which making the Navicula contact closelywith surfaces,only few Navicula settled on the flat area(Fig.3d).So the Navicula density on surface was determined by the settlement in the grooves.The surface with grooves spaced $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ showed the highest Navicula density compared to all other surface with grooves because which having the highest number of grooves.The results proved Navicula's settling selectivity more directly,Navicula settled preferentially in valleys and against pillars and pits.

Fig.4.Closterium reduction ratio of textured surfaces compared to the control surface.

Another kind of algae,Closterium,was used to test the antifouling performance of the textured surfaces (Fig.4). Closterium's sizewas $4 5 - 5 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ which was much larger than that of textures. The reduction rate of the surfaces with pillars and pits both tended to be greater,as the distance of pillars or pits decreased.Compared to the control surface,the highest reduction ratio of surfaces with pillar was $73 \%$ ,greater than that of surfaces with pits $( 5 1 \% )$ . Relative to the control surface,the surfaces with groove spaced 3,6, 9 and $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ apart all showed statistically significant reduction inClosteriumdensitywhichdistinctlydifferent fromNavicula.The reduction ratio of the surface with groove spaced $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and $6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ was $5 0 \%$ and $5 5 \%$ .Ahigher reduction ratio $( 7 4 \% )$ was obtained on the surface with grooves spaced ${ \mathfrak { s } } { \mathfrak { \mu } } { \mathfrak { m } }$ compared to both the grooves spaced with $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and $6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .The surface with grooves spaced $1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ showed the highest reduction ratio $( 8 1 \% )$ compared to all other surface with grooves.

Fig.5.Ulothrix reduction ratio of textured surfaces compared to the control surface

The surface with pillars,pits and grooves all showed well capability of antifouling when resisting Closterium which is significantly differentto that of Navicula.Researchers presented thattopography altered wettability[22,23] and wettability influenced bioadhesion [24].Results previously confirmed that the organism's responses were governed by the same underlying thermodynamic principles aswettability when its size was much bigger than feature size [15].Closterium (length: $4 5 \mathrm { - } 5 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ )wastoo large torest between or in the three textures,it should bridge on two or more pillars, pits or grooves.Considering Closterium settling ona textured surface,bridging is similar to theair pocket state described by the Cassie-Baxter relation or alternatively,conforming similar to Wenzel behaviour.Compared to the reduction ratio of each textured surface(Table1),it could almost finda basicrule thata higher mean reduction ratio was obtained ona surfacewhich had a greater contact angle of water.

In order to reveal the relationship between algae size and texture geometry in detail,we further characterized the antifouling behavior of surfaces with pillars and grooves by evaluating their inhibitory effect on the Ulothrix(Fig.5). Ulothrix's size was $\mathsf { 5 } { - } 8 \mathsf { m m }$ which was the biggest among the three algae selected.

Theresults ofUlothrix,Closterium and Navicula's reduction ratio of the surfaces with pillars showed that the surface showed markedly different antifouling performance for different algae (Fig.6a).For the same surface,it displayed the bestantifouling performance to the Ulothrix with the largest size.And when resisted the smallest Navicula,the performance became worst.For example,the reduction ratio ofUlothrix's settlement on the surface with pillars spaced $6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ was $70 \%$ ，for Closterium and Navicula,the reduction ratioswere $62 \%$ and $56 \%$ ,respectively.Anyhow,the surface with pillars spaced $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ always showed the highest reduction ratio,no matterresistingUlothrix,ClosteriumorNavicula.

The surfaces with grooves displayed the similar performance (Fig.6b).For the same surface,the best antifouling performance appeared on controlling Ulothrix's settling.And antifouling performance was getting worse with the decreased size of algae. For example,the reduction ratio of Ulothrix and Closterium's settlement of the surface with grooves spaced $3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ could reach $6 3 \%$ and $50 \%$ But,this surface settled $3 7 \%$ more Navicula than on the control surface.

For the surface with pits,the settlement reduction rate of Ulothrix compared to the control surface tended to increase as the distance of pits decreased like that of Closterium and Navicula because more pits reduced the adhesion area and adhesion strength.But there were no differences in the reduction rate of three algae because most body of the Ulothrix,Closterium or Navicula could contact to the flat areas of the surface with pits (Fig. 6c).

So the anti-fouling performance of textured surface was not only closely related to feature geometry and size,but also related to thealgae's size.On one side,if thealgae were bridged between two or more features,the attachment area and the overall adhesion strength must be reduced so that biological fouling could be deterred.But,the algae was also able to stabilize its entire mass on one single feature or beable to settle between features,they would attach more and more to the surface.When the size of foulingalgae wasclose to the textures,the feature size and geometry displayed a substantial correlation with the antifouling properties because they determined which two settling case mentioned above the organism will select.And when the size of fouling algae was much bigger than that of the textures,the fouling organism was more likely to bridge on top of two or more features; their responses were governed by the sameunderlying thermodynamic principlesas wettability.And antifouling performance was getting better with the bigger size of algae because the algae were more and more impossible to stabilize their entire mass on one single feature or to settle between features.

# 4.Conclusions

This research designed SMAR surface with regular pillars,pits and grooves.The effect of feature size,geometry,and wettability on the settlement of different algae has been thoroughly studied by comparing the antifouling performance of different surface against Ulothrix,Closterium and Navicula.The results predict that a textured surface which having fit feature so that the algae can bridge on between two or more features,and do not provide the area foralgae displaying excellentanti-fouling performance.Synergy of both structure and surface composition provides a promising way of designing environment-benign marine anti-fouling coatings.
