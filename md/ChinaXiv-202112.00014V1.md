Abstract: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the eco-physiological responses, in terms of growth and C:N:P stoichiometry of plants cultured from dimorphic seeds of a single-cell $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ annual Suaeda aralocaspica (Bunge) Freitag and Schitze under elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ . A climatic chamber experiment was conducted to examine the effects of ambient $( 7 2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ and $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ -enriched $( 1 4 4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L } )$ treatments on these responses in $S$ 、aralocaspica at vegetative and reproductive stages in 2O12. Result showed that elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ significantly increased shoot dry weight, but decreased N:P ratio at both growth stages. Plants grown from dimorphic seeds did not exhibit significant diferences in growth and C:N:P stoichiometric characteristics.The transition from vegetation to reproductive stage significantly increased shoot:root ratio, N and $\mathrm { \Delta P }$ contents, but decreased C:N, C:P and N:P ratios, and did not affect shoot dry weight. Moreover, our results indicate that the changes in N:P and C:N ratios between ambient and elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ are mainly caused by the decrease of $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ content under elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ . These results provide an insight into nutritional metabolism of single-cell $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants under climate change.

# 1 Introduction

Since First Industrial Revolution, atmospheric $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ has steadily increased,and current concentration is above $7 2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ and could reach $1 4 4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ by the year 2100 (IPCC,2013; Betts et al.,2016). Such elevation in atmospheric $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ induces several alterations in plant metabolism. Growth and ecological responses of terrestrial plants to elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ have been determined on three main types of photosynthesis: $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ ， $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) types (Ceusters and Borland,2011; Reich et al.,2018; Quirk et al.,2019). Responses of different plant functional types differ to elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ . In many $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ and CAM plants, plant growth is stimulated by elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ (Ceusters and Borland, 2011；Boretti and Florentine,2019；Li et al.,2020). However, $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants show little or no increase in productivity with elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ (Boretti and

Florentine,2O19). So far, there is no information available regarding responses of $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ species without Kranz anatomy to atmospheric $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ elevation.

Some plants can produce heteromorphic seeds that are distinctly different in morphology, color. dormancy and germination traits (Imbert, 2002； Zhao et al.， 2018). Plants cultured from heteromorphic seeds can also differ in their growth responses under different growth conductions, including biotic and abiotic factors (Redondo-Gomez et al.,2008; Jiang et al.,202O). However, the effects of elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ on growth,ecological and physiochemical characteristics are still unknown for seed-heteromorphic plants.

Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents and C:N:P ratio is associated with plant adaptation strategy to environmental changes (Du et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021). C, N and $\mathrm { ~ \bf ~ P ~ }$ provide the structural basis of plants and play essential role in photosynthesis and growth (Marschner, 2013).Though these elements are maintained at relative cellular concentration in plants, C:N:P stoichiometry of plants can be greatly affected under different environmental conditions (Deng et al.,2015). Numerous simulation experiments were carried out to study the response of elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ on plant C:N:P stoichiometry (Pérez-Romero et al., 2018; Du et al., 2019; Uchytilova et al., 2019). However, the effects of elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ remain inconsistent, for example,an average of $22 \%$ increase in the foliar C:N ratio in $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ grasses and forbs was observed under high $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration, but no significant effects were observed in $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ grasses (Sardans et al.,2012).

Suaeda aralocaspica (Bunge) Freitag and Schuitze is a habitant of the saline and semi-arid deserts in Central Asia (Commissione Redactorum Florae Xinjiangensis,1994). This plant does not have dual-cell (Kranz） system,but has unusual mechanisms of $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ photosynthesis by dimorphic chloroplasts in individual chlorenchyma cells via intracellular compartmentation (Voznesenskaya et al.,20o1). In S. aralocaspica, photosynthetic chloroplasts are assembled at the proximal end in the flower and leaves,while other chloroplasts positioned and partitioned on the fringe of the cells at their distal end. In $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ cycles， atmospheric $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ is fixed via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) at the distal end of the cell, which produces $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ acids and donates $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ to rubisco in chloroplasts at the proximal end of the cell (Boyd et al., 2007).

We conducted a chamber experiment to examine the growth and C:N:P stoichiometry for plants grown from dimorphic seeds of this single-cell $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ species to elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ . We hypothesized that plants from dimorphic seeds might have differential eco-physiological responses to $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ elevation at different growth stages.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1 Seed collection and experimental design

Freshly matured S. aralocaspica fruits were harvested from the southern edge of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, in October 2011. Fruits were naturally dried for 2 weeks at ambient room conditions. Dry fruits were rubbed by hand and both brown and black seeds were separated and stored in plastic bags at room temperature $( 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ！

A pot experiment was conducted in two growth chambers (day/night air temperatures: $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the first three months and then $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } / 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ）at Fukang National Field Scientific Observation and Research Station for Desert Ecosystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences $( 4 4 ^ { \circ } 1 7 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ $8 7 ^ { \circ } 5 6 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E }$ · $4 6 0 \mathrm { \ m a . s . l . } ,$ ）in Xinjiang, China. The average concentration of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ for growth chambers was either 720 or $1 4 4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ . The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ levels were continuously controlled with an automatic $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ supply system (ESHENGTAIHE CTRL TECH, YB6,Beijing,China).

Twenty seeds of each brown and black seeds were sown into plastic pots （ $1 7 \ \mathrm { c m }$ deep and 16 cm in diameter) filled with $2 \mathrm { ~ L ~ }$ mix of quartz sand and vermiculite $( 3 { : } 1 { \mathrm { ~ v / v } } )$ at a soil depth of 2 mm. Two weeks after, one seedling was kept per pot, and seedlings with similar height and growth were kept for further experimentation.In each pot, $\textup { 6 } \textup { g }$ of Osmocote 301 (Scotts, Marysville, OH, USA) was applied prior to sowing and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ of Peters 1 nutrient solution was applied once a week. Salt stress was imposed at 4 weeks after sowing using a mixed salt $\mathrm { N a C l { : } N a _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } { : } N a H C O _ { 3 } }$ (20:20:1). Each pot received $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ salt solution $( 1 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L } )$ once a week (Wang et al.,2Ol2). Six plants grown from each seed type were harvested for the first time1157 under each $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ level on 15 July 2012. The second harvest took place on 15 September 2012.

# 2.2 Data collection

# 2.2.1 Plant biomass

After harvesting, shoot and root parts were separated and dried in the oven at $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to reach a constant weight. Shoot and root biomasses were measured by an electronic analytical balance.

# 2.2.2 C, N and $\mathrm { ~ \bf ~ P ~ }$ content

Before chemical analysis, the dried shoot materials were ground in a ball mill,and then passed through a $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { - m m }$ sieve.The ball mill was cleaned completely after each sample milling.The shoot C content was determined using titration method after digested in $\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 7 } { \cdot } \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ (Bao, 2000).N content was determined using Kjeldahl method after digestion in $_ \mathrm { H _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } - H C l O _ { 4 } }$ (Lin et al.,2011). P content was determined by colorimetric analysis (formation of chloro-phosphoric molybdate) after digestion in ${ \mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { S O } } _ { 4 }$ -HClO4 (Ren et al., 2018).

# 2.3 Statistical analyses

All data were expressed as mean±standard error. The data meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. Split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the effects of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ level and seed type on shoot and root dry weights, shoot C, N and $\mathrm { \bf P }$ contents,and their ratios in S.aralocaspica plants,with $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ level (720 or $1 4 4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / L }$ ） as main plot and seed type (brown and black seeds) as subplot at vegetative or reproductive stage. Alldata analyses were performed using SPSS v13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

# 3 Results

Elevation of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ significantly increased shoot dry weight (SDW） both at vegetative and reproductive stages, but did not afect root dry weight (RDW) and shoot:root ratio. Plants grown from dimorphic seeds showed similar SDW, RDW and shoot:root ratio at the same growth stage under the same $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ condition (Fig.1; Table S1). RDW decreased and shoot:root ratio increased during the transition from vegetative to reproductive stage (Fig. 1).

Elevation of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ significantly decreased $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ content for plants grown from black seeds at vegetative stage,and did not affect other stoichiometric characteristics.Plants cultured from dimorphic seeds had the same C, N and $\mathrm { ~ \bf ~ P ~ }$ contents for both $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ treatments at the same growth stage (Fig. 2; Table S1). N and $\mathrm { ~ \bf ~ P ~ }$ contents in shoot significantly increased from vegetative stage to reproductive stage, however C content significantly decreased during this transition (Fig. 2). The range of C contents was between 309.4 and $3 3 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / g }$ . Plants from black seeds at elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ showed the highest N $( 2 2 . 8 \ : \mathrm { m g / g ) }$ and $\mathrm { ~ \bf ~ P ~ }$ content $( 3 . 7 \mathrm { m g / g } )$ at reproductive stage (Fig. 2d and f).

Plants grown from dimorphic seeds had the same C:N, N:P or C:P ratio at same growth stage under the same $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ condition (Fig. 3). Compared with vegetative stage, plants at reproductive stage had lower C:N, C:P and N:P ratios (Table S1). Plants grown from black seeds at elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ showed the lowest C:N ratio (14.3) and C:P (89.7) at reproductive stage (Fig. 3b and d). N:P ratio significantly decreased under elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ in both plant types at vegetation stage (Fig. 3e).

# 4Discussion

Although the growth and C:N:P stoichiometry of plants with different photosynthetic pathways subjected to elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ have been studied extensively (Sardans et al., 2O12; Deng et al., 2015; Du et al., 2019), our data are the first in which responses to $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ elevation have been documented for single-cell $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants.In addition,our data indicate that elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ significantly increases the shoot growth at both vegetative and reproductive stages,but not the root growth and C:N:P stoichiometry. The results also indicate that plants cultured from dimorphic seeds of $S$ aralocaspica have similar growth and C:N:P stoichiometry.

Fig.3Effects of elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ on C:N ratio (a and b), C:P ratio (c and d),and N:P ratio (e and f) in shoots of plants grown from dimorphic seeds of Suaeda aralocaspica at vegetative and reproductive stages.\* indicates significant difference between ambient and elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ treatments at $P { < } 0 . 0 5$ level.

Elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ alters plant growth, contents of C,N and $\mathrm { \bf ~ P } ,$ and C:N and N:P ratios (Li et al., 2019).Our results confirmed that elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ significantly accelerated shoot growth and decreased $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ content of S. aralocaspica, which was consistent with previous studies. On average, $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ content in plant tissue decreases by about $14 \%$ under elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ (Cotrufo et al., 1998). Elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ has different effects on the $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ contents of different plant types and the reduction in $\mathrm { ~ N ~ }$ contents is smaller in $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ plants than in $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ plants. The changes in C:N and N:P ratios of $S$ aralocaspica between ambient and elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ are mainly caused by the decrease of $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ content at elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ . The results coincide with previous results that C:N ratio increases under elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ regimes (Sardans et al., 2012).

Differences exist not only in seed size and germination of heteromorphic seeds but also in plant growth characteristics and even maintain until the end of growing season (Imbert, 2002). Contrary to owning differences in seed dormancy, germination and plant reproduction (Wang et al.,2008,2012),plants cultured from dimorphic seeds of $S$ ， aralocaspica did not significantly differ in their responses to $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ elevation. The differential response of heteromorphic seeds is effective in reducing the offspring survive risk in unpredictably fluctuating environments. For example,dimorphic seeds of $S$ ，aralocaspica show different salt tolerance(Wang et al., 2008). Because the steady increase of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentrations is the same for plants grown from dimorphic seeds of S. aralocaspica, it is not surprising that both plant types show similar growth and C:N:P stoichiometric characteristics.

Our results showed that $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ and $\mathrm { \bf P }$ contents increased with plant developmental stage. This could be explained by that plants at reproductive stage need a higher nutrient concentration to support fruiting (Marschner,2013).C content of $S .$ aralocaspica was significantly lower than that $( 4 6 . 4 \%$ C) of global terrestrial plants (Elser et al., 2Ooo). Decrease of C allocation at reproductive stage could be related to a high salt accumulation of this species.

# 5 Conclusions

Our results reinforce the conclusion that there is no difference between plants grown from heteromorphic seeds in the responsiveness of ecophysiology to steady environmental factors. Elevated $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ greatly decreased $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ content and then caused the change of N:P ratio of $S$ aralocaspica. Our results could enrich the plant response pattrn of different types of photosynthesis to $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ elevation. If we want to accurately predict responses of various plants under future $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration, further work is necessary to explore representative plants of special plant photosynthetic types, such as single-cell $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } { \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ intermediate plant species.
