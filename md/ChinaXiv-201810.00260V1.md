Abstract: Gallic acid (GA） is a phenolic compound，and presents various biological activities in plants. Our previous experiments demonstrated a relatively strong inhibitory effect of GA on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola $( X o c )$ . In order to elucidate the effects of GA on the cell structure and membrane permeability of the pathogen，morphologies of bacteria treated with GA were observed by electron microscopy，the integrity and the permeabilities of membrane of Xoc were investigated by determining the release from cells of materials that absorb at $2 6 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，changes in the fluorescence of cells treated with the fluorescein diacetate(FDA) and lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) activity. Treatment with 200 $\mu \mathrm { g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ ， many pits and irregular vesicles were observed on the cell surface under electron microscopy， indicating that GA could damage the cell walls of Xoc. The electrical conductivity from Xoc suspensions $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ after GA treatment was $1 3 5 . 4 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { S } \cdot \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ （Control was $1 2 7 . 8 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { S } \cdot \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } )$ ，and the fluorescence intensity of Xoc suspensions $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ after GA decreased by $5 8 . 1 0 \%$ ，indicating that cells leaked electrolytes and cytosolic contents. Meanwhile, the activities of LDH in bacterial suspensions treated with GA also increased, suggesting that GA could damage the structure of the bacterial cell membrane. In addition, the absorbance at $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ from Xoc suspensions was 1.004（control was 0.018）,indicating that GA could negatively affect Xoc cell wall integrity. These results indicate that GA not only altered the permeability of the cell membrane of Xoc,but also impacted the integrity of the cell membrane.

摘要：没食子酸（gallic acid，GA）是一种植物酚类化合物，具有多种生物活性。本研究的前期试验发现，GA 对水稻细菌性条斑病菌（Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzicola，Xoc）具有较强的抑制作用。为了解该物质对Xoc 的细胞结构和细胞膜的影响，本研究用电子显微镜观察GA 对 Xoc 的形态结构的影响，通过测定GA 处理后的 Xoc 培养液的电导率、紫外吸收物含量（ $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { \ n m } }$ 的吸光值）、乳酸脱氢酶的活性以及菌体的二乙酸荧光素（fluorescein diacetate，FDA）的强度等探讨GA对 Xoc 细胞膜的完整性和通透性的影响。试验结果显示，经浓度为 $2 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 } }$ 的 GA处理后，Xoc 的菌体形态结构发生改变，表面有明显的凹陷或不规则囊泡状突起，表明GA 对 Xoc 细胞壁有损伤作用。 $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g \cdot m L } ^ { - 1 }$ 的GA处理 $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ 后，病菌培养液的电导率为 $1 3 5 . 4 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { S } { \cdot } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ （对照处理为 $1 2 7 . 8 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { S } \cdot \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ），GA处理 $^ \mathrm { ~ 2 ~ h ~ }$ 后，Xoc 细胞荧光强度下降 $5 8 . 1 0 \%$ ，说明病菌细胞内电解质外渗和细胞溶质发生渗漏；同时，乳酸脱氢酶的活性增加，表明菌体的细胞膜受到破坏。此外，GA 处理$2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ 后，Xoc 培养液在 $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ 下的吸光值为1.004（对照处理为0.018），表明病菌细胞膜的完整性受到破坏。研究结果表明，GA不仅破坏Xoc 的细胞膜通透性，而且也影响膜的完整性。

Bacterial leaf streak of rice, which is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola $( X o c )$ ,is one of the important plant diseases in South China. This disease was first reported in Philippines in 1918 and was reported in China in 1953. Bacterial leaf streak of rice can reduce yield loss by $40 \% - 6 0 \%$ ，and the disease severely threatens the high and stable yield production of rice. Furthermore,the transportation of rice seeds during production tends to expand and aggravate this disease (Zhang et al, 2O15). Because bacterial leaf streak-resistant rice cultivars are not available, bactericides are mainly used to control the disease.However,few bactericides,such as zinc thiazole and thiodiazole copper，are registered in China (Wei et al，2OO7). Therefore，the development of new bactericides to manage this disease is desirable.

Gallic acid [GA: 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid $( \mathrm { C _ { 6 } H _ { 2 } ( O H ) _ { 3 } C O O H ] }$ is a phenolic compound in plants that exists as a free molecule and as a constituent of tannins (Masoud et al, 2O12). Studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of GA against Salmonella typhimurium (Nohynek et al,2006),Escherichia coli (Chanwitheesuk et al, 20O7),Bacillus subtilis (Zhang et al,2013), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (Sarjit et al,2O15). GA may effectively inhibit the invasion ability of gastric cancer MGC-8O3 cels (Li et al,2O17).Our early work involving the screening of plants for antibacterial activity against Xoc showed that GA extracted from Sedum lineare significantly inhibited the growth of plant pathogens such as Xoc, X. oryzae pv. oryzae, X.campestris pv. pruni, X. axonopodis pv. citri, Ralstonia solanacearum, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea, P. syringae pv. tomato and Pectobacterium carotovora subsp.carotovora in vitro.

Reports on the antibacterial mechanisms of GA exist. GA damages the cell membrane of Pseudomonas fluorescens,which induced the leakage of intracellular electrolytes and abundant molecular material(Lu et al, 2O15). GA may potentially capture calcium ions from the calciumbinding proteins on the cell surfaces of Campylobacter by chelation,resulting in the loss of vital functions of those proteins and therefore cell death (Sarjit et al，2O15).GA inhibits the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cels by inhibiting the expression of Survivin mRNA (Li et al, 2014),inhibits the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 by regulating PI3K / AKT signaling pathway,and also effectively inhibits plankton SH FurnRi activity and biofilm formation by regulating the expression of MDOH gene and OPGH protein (Kang et al, 2018). GA plays an antibacterial role by destroying the membrane integrity of Aeromonas hydrophila and aeromonas cold blood (Lu et al,2016).To our knowledge,no reports on the mechanisms of GA against Xoc have been published. In the present paper，we evaluated the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of GA against Xoc and the effects of GA on the cell structure and membrane permeability of the pathogen. The results will provide a theoretical basis for further GA applications.

# 1 Materials and methods

# 1.1Materials

GA was obtained from the Tianjin Kemiou chemical reagent development center. An assay kit for determining the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was obtained from Suzhou Comin Biotechnology Co,Ltd, China. Methanol, ethyl acetate,glutaraldehyde,iodoacetic acid, sodium phosphate, propanedioic acid, phenol, fluorescein diacetate (FDA), 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, trichloroacetic acid,sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium polypectinate, sodium hydroxide and absolute alcohol were of the highest grade commercially available.

# 1.2 Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Xoc strain $X _ { 0 ^ { - } } 0 0 2$ was isolated from an infected rice leaf in 2O1O in Guangxi and was preserved at the Plant Pathology Research Institute of Guangxi University, Nanning, China. The strain was stored on nutrient agar (NA: $3 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ of beef extract, $\boldsymbol { 5 } \mathrm { \textrm { g } }$ of peptone, $\boldsymbol { 1 0 } \mathrm { \ : g }$ of dextrose, $\boldsymbol { 1 7 } \mathrm { \textrm { g } }$ （204号 of agar, $1 ~ 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ of distilled water, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0 \$ at $- 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and was initially cultured on NA at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2 days,after which the strain was transferred into beef extract broth and shaken at $1 2 0 \mathrm { r } { \cdot } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ at $2 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ (during the logarithmic phase).

# 1.3 Antimicrobial susceptibility tests

Minimum inhibitory concentration（MIC) was tested using a 2-fold serial broth dilution as described here. Xoc at the logarithmic growth phase were diluted in a ${ 1 0 } ^ { 7 }$ colony-forming units (CFU) $\mathrm { \ m L ^ { - 1 } }$ suspension of beef extract. GA dissolved in $10 \%$ methanol was added to the bacterial suspension to a final GA concentration ranging from 3.125 to $4 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ . The bacterial suspension with only $10 \%$ methanol served as the control. The suspension was then shaken at 120 $\operatorname { r } { \cdot } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ . The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent at which the cell growth was not visible with the naked eye.Each treatment was replicated three times.

To determine the effects of initial bacterial density on the GA inhibition,Xoc at the logarithmic growth phase were diluted to $1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { \ C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ ， $1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { \ C F U \cdot m L ^ { - 1 } }$ or $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { \ C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ in suspension of beef extract. GA was added to the bacterial suspension until final GA concentrations of MIC or 2 MIC were reached. The suspension was then shaken at $1 2 0 \ \mathrm { r \cdot m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ . Each treatment was replicated for three times.

# 1.4Electron microscopy

Xoc at the logarithmic growth phase were diluted with beef extract to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { \ C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ . GA (dissolved in $10 \%$ methanol） was added to the bacterial suspension to reach a final GA concentration of MIC.The bacterial suspension with only $10 \%$ methanol served as the control. After shaking at $1 2 0 \mathrm { r } { \cdot } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ and $2 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 6,12 or $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ ,the suspension was centrifuged. The cells were washed three times with $0 . 2 { \bf M }$ sodium phosphate buffer (PBS, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 4 \$ ）and then fixed with $2 . 5 \%$ glutaraldehyde in $0 . 2 \textbf { M }$ PBS.The samples were prepared for electron microscopy as previously described (Nakajima et al, 2OO3). The prepared samples were examined using an electron microscope (H-5Oo,Hitachi, Japan)

# 1.5 Electrical conductivity assay

Pathogens were diluted with beef extract to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { \ C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ . GA was added to the bacterial suspension to reach final GA concentrations of $1 / 2$ MIC,MIC or 2 MIC. The bacterial suspension with only $10 \%$ methanol served as the control. After shaking at $1 2 0 \mathrm { r } { \cdot } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ at $2 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8or $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,the suspension was centrifuged, after which the supernatant was diluted 2O times with water and measured for its electrical conductivity. Each treatment was replicated three times.

# 1.6 Cell membrane integrity assay

The cell membrane integrity of Xoc was evaluated by determining the release of materials that absorb at $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .Bacteria at the logarithmic growth phase were washed three times with PBS and then diluted with PBS to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ . GA was added to the bacterial suspension to reach final GA concentrations of 1/2 MIC,MIC or 2 MIC. The suspension with only $10 \%$ methanol served as the control. Each treatment was replicated three times.The suspension was shaken at $1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { r \cdot m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ at $2 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 or $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ , after which it was centrifuged at $4 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { g }$ （204号 for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . The release of materials that absorb at $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ was monitored over time using a UVVisible spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-180O; Shimadzu Corp, Kyoto, Japan)

# 1.7 Outer membrane (OM) permeabilization assay

The OM permeabilization activity of cell was determined using an FDA assay as described by Zeng et al(2Ol3). Xoc at the logarithmic growth phase were diluted with beef extract to a ${ 1 0 } ^ { 8 }$ $\mathrm { { C F U } \cdot \mathrm { { m L } ^ { - 1 } } }$ . GA was added to the bacterial suspension to reach a final GA concentration of MIC. The suspension with only $10 \%$ methanol served as the control. After shaking at $1 3 0 \ \mathrm { r { \cdot m i n } ^ { - 1 } }$ at $2 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 \mathrm { h }$ ,the suspension was centrifuged.The cells were washed three times with PBS.FDA was then added to the bacterial suspension to reach a final FDA concentration of $0 . 2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot \mathrm { m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ and the suspension was incubated at room temperature for $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Fluorescence excited at a wavelength of $4 6 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and an emission wavelength of $6 8 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ was recorded using an RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). All experiments were replicated thre times.

# 1.8 Determination of the activity of LDH in the bacterial suspension

Xoc at the logarithmic growth phase were diluted with beef extract to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ . GA was added to the bacterial suspension to reach a final GA concentration of 1Oo, 200 or $4 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ ： The bacterial suspension with only $10 \%$ methanol served as the control. After being exposed to GA for 0,2, 4, 8,16 or $2 4 \mathrm { h } , 2 \mathrm { L }$ of culture was centrifuged at ${ \mathrm { 1 ~ 0 0 0 \times g } }$ for $5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The LDH activity in the supernatant was determined using an assay kit (Suzhou Comin Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

All experiments were replicated three times. The formation of 1 nmol of pyruvic acid upon the exposure of $1 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of bacterial protein to extracellular matrix for $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ was defined as 1 unit of activity in the reaction systems.

Protein concentration wasdetermined in accordance with the coomassie brilliant blue staining method. A $3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ coomassie brilliant blue color reagent was added to $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of distilled water, $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { \ m L }$ of standard protein solution and $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { \ m L }$ of sample liquid,which represented a control tube, standard tube and testing tube, respectively, for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ . The tubes were then and measured for their optical density at $5 9 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ $( \mathrm { O D } _ { 5 9 5 } )$ ） nm using a UV spectrophotometer, and the protein content was calculated as follows:

Standard bube concentration $\times$ (test tube OD- Standard tube) Protein content(mg · mL-1)=

# 1.9 Statistical analysis

The data were subjected to the analysis of variance using SAS software (version 6.O8, SAS Institute，Cary，NC).Mean comparisons were conducted using a least significant difference (Fisher's LSD) test at $P = 0 . 0 5$ . The standard error and LSD results were recorded.

# 2.1 MIC of GA on Xoc

Xoc cultured for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ grew in NA containing $3 . 1 2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot } { \mathrm { m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ to $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot \mathrm { m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ GA (Table 1). However, the culture solution was transparent in the NA supplemented with $2 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ GA, which indicates that the MIC of GA was $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$

# 2.2 Effects of GA on Xoc cell morphology

The effect of GA on the cellular structure of the Xoc was visualized using transmission electron microscopy (Fig.1). Control cells cultured for $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ had a full shape and smooth surface; the cell membrane adhered to the cell wall,and the cytoplasm was homogeneous (Fig.1:A). However, GA-treated Xoc showed deformation and roughness of cell walls (Fig.1:B,C) after $6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ and $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,the cell outlines appeared blurry, the cell wall was loose after $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，and some cells had an irregular shape and no membrane or cell wall on one side (Fig.1:D).

Fig. 1 Transmission electron microscopy images of normal Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola and those affected by GA

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that Xoc cells treated with GA at the MIC changed remarkably compared with control cells (Fig.2). The surface of control cells was smooth and cells were obvious after $1 2 \mathrm { { h } }$ of culture (Fig.2:A). However, granules and holes were observed on the surface of GA-treated cells after $6 \textup { h }$ and $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ (Fig.2:B,C),and many pits and irregular vesicles were observed on the cell surface after $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ (Fig.2:D). Therefore, GA could damage the cell wall of $X o c$ ,and the effect was greater with the duration of treatment.

# 2.3Effects of GA on the electrical conductivity of bacteria culture media

The effect of GA on the electrical conductivity of the culture solution is shown in Fig.3. Electrical conductivity increased with time. GA treatments at concentrations of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ ，200 $\mu \mathrm { g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ ，and $4 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ and the control culture liquid resulted in electrical conductivities of 129.03，132.80,135.48 and $1 2 7 . 8 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { S } { \cdot } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ，respectively,after $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ of incubation. The result indicated that the higher the concentration of GA was,the more serious the leakage of electrolytes from the cell.

Columns with different lowercase letters represent significant differences at O.O5.The same below.

# 2.4 Effects of GA on the content of UV-absorbing compounds of bacterial culture media

When antimicrobial agents damage bacterial membranes, intracellular components, such as DNA and RNA, tend to leak. The release of DNA and RNA from cells can be detected by UV at $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ as an indication of membrane damage (Chen & Cooper, 2OO2). The content of UVabsorbing compounds from Xoc suspensions treated with GA is shown in Fig. 4.GA treatment concentrations altered the absorbance: the higher the GA treatment concentration was,the larger the absorbance.Treatment with 10o, 200 and $4 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ GA for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ resulted in absorbances of 0.195,1.0O4 and 1.72O,respectively,and the difference between GA treatment and the control (0.018) was statistically significant. This result indicated that GA could negatively affect Xoc cell wall integrity.

# 2.5 Effects of GA on the permeability of bacteria

FDA, which can enter the cell, is a nonfluorescent compound that is hydrolyzed to fluorescein and acetate by nonspecifc esterases. The intracellular retention of fluorescein depends on the integrity of the cell membrane (Prudéncio et al, 1998). The change in fluorescence intensity after GA $( 2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ） treatment for $2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ was presented in Fig. 5. Stained cells displayed the most intense fluorescence at $5 1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .The fluorescence intensities of both $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } \cdot \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ GA-treated and control cells were $5 3 . 0 6 \%$ and $9 1 . 3 3 \%$ ,respectively. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of the treated cells decreased by $5 8 . 1 0 \%$ ,and the cytosolic contents had leaked out from the cells.

# 2.6EffectsofGA on the activity of the LDH of bacteria

The bacterial endoenzyme LDH could leak from bacteria upon cell membrane damage. Therefore, the activity of LDH in the bacterial suspension reflects the change in permeability of the cell membrane(Hara & Yamakawa，1995). The activities of LDH in the bacterial suspensions were shown in Fig. 6. The activities of LDH in bacterial suspensions treated with GA (100,200 and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ）and the control were less than $1 . 5 \mathrm { U } { \cdot } \mathrm { m g } ^ { - 1 }$ protein after treatment for 2 h; there was no significant difference between the GA treatment and the control. However, the enzymatic activities of GA-treated suspensions were higher than those of the control after $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ . The enzymatic activities increased with GA dose and duration. The results suggested that GA could damage the structure of the bacterial cell membrane and caused the leakage of LDH enzymes.

# 3 Discussion

A concentration of $2 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ GA completely inhibited cells at $1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ ; therefore, the MIC of GA on Xoc was $2 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ in these conditions. The antibacterial function of GA differed against different concentrations of bacteria. However, treatment with 20o and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } { \cdot } \mathrm { m L }$ $^ { 1 } { \mathrm { G A } }$ inhibited the development and growth of the pathogenic bacteria at concentrations of ${ 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ and $1 0 ^ { 7 } \mathrm { C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ ,but these GA treatments could not completely suppress the growth of bacteria at $1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U { \cdot } m L ^ { - 1 } }$ ：

The cell wall maintains the inherent morphology of cells and exchanges substances.When the cell wall of a bacterium has been disrupted by an antimicrobial substance, the cell permeability is altered, materials can leak from the cell (Bush, 2O12). Electron micrographs showed that GAtreated Xoc displayed damaged cell walls that showed signs of pits and irregular vesicles on the outer surface.A similar finding was reported by Helander et al,(2OO1). Furthermore,GA treatment resulted in a higher culture liquid electrical conductivity than that of the control. Thus, cell wall damage is at least one mechanism by which Xoc was negatively affected by GA.

An essential function of the cell membrane is serving as a selectively permeable barrier. The exposure to high concentrations of antimicrobial agents can alter the permeability of bacterial cell membranes and hinder normal bacterial metabolism (Bush， 2O12). Our experimental results showed that GA enhanced the conductivity of the culture medium, which led to cytoplasm leakage and resulted in the leakage of intracellular DNA and RNA.These phenomena are similar to those reported for Pseudomonas fluorescens treated with GA (Lu et al, 2O15), suggesting that GA could negatively affect Xoc cell wall integrity. Furthermore,the fluorescence intensity of cells treated with GA decreased to $5 8 . 1 0 \%$ , indicating that the cytosolic contents had leaked out from cells.In addition,the activity of intracellular LDH in the bacterial suspension treated with GA was higher than that of control, suggesting that LDH diffused outside the cell.

Our early works have demonstrated that GA could control rice bacterial leaf streak, with control efficacy of $6 4 . 5 4 \%$ in field(Wang et al, 2O18). GA derivatives,methyl gallate,had atibacteria activity against Ralstonia solanacearum, Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans and Pectobacterium carotovora subsp.carotora(Yuan et al, 2O12),and could effectively reduce the incidence of tomato bacterial wilt in the field(Li et al，2O14). Meawhile，four galic acid derivatives have also ati-bacteria activity against Ahernaria mali， Physalospora Piricola, Rhizoctonia solani and Phytophthora infestans(Tan et al,2O18).Therefore,GA and its derivatives have potential to be developed as a new pesticide to control plant disease.

In conclusion, the results suggest that GA altered Xoc membrane permeability and disrupts membrane integrity. Increasing concentrations of GA resulted in more evident damage. The results showed that the cell membrane was a target for bacterial growth inhibition.
