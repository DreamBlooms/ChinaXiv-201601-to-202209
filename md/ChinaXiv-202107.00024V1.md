Abstract: The extreme temperature has more outstanding impact on ecology and water resources in arid regions than the average temperature. Using the downscaled daily temperature data from 21 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) models of NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) and the observation data, this paper analyzed the changes in temporal and spatiotemporal variation of temperature extremes,i.e.,the maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin),in the Kaidu-Kongqi River basin in Northwest China over the period 2020-2050 based on the evaluation of preferred Multi-Model Ensemble (MME).Results showed that the Partial Least Square ensemble mean participated by Preferred Models (PM-PLS) was beter representing the temporal change and spatial distribution of temperature extremes during 1961-20O5 and was chosen to project the future change.In 202O-2050,the increasing rate of Tmax (Tmin) under RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway)8.5 willbe 2.O (1.6) times that under RCP4.5,and that of Tmin willbe larger than that of Tmax under each corresponding RCP. Tmin will keep contributing more to global warming than Tmax. The spatial distribution characteristics of Tmax and Tmin under the two RCPs wil overall the same; but compared to the baseline period (1986-2005),the increments of Tmax and Tmin in plain area willbe larger than those in mountainous area.With the emisson concentration increased, however,the response of Tmax in mountainous area will be more sensitive than that in plain area,and that of Tmin will be equivalently sensitive in mountainous area and plain area.The impacts induced by Tmin willbe universal and farreaching. Results of spatiotemporal variation of temperature extremes indicate that large increases in the magnitude of warming in the basin may occur in the future.The projections can provide the scientific basis for water and land plan management and disaster prevention and mitigation in the inland river basin.

# 1 Introduction

Temperature plays a key role in climate system. Scientific projection of future temperature change and quantitative assessment of uncertainties of temperature change are not only conducive to the prediction of future climate change,but also significant in formulating policies to cope with climate

change (IPCC, 2014; Qin, 2014). In the future, climate warming wil further accelerate the water circulation of river basins and change the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources (Chen et al., 2017; Yu et al.,2O19).The rising temperature has substantial impacts on agriculture, people's daily lives and socioeconomic development (Bariopedro et al.,2011; Wu and Yan, 2013; Guan et al., 2015). Compared with the average temperature, the impact of extreme temperature on ecology and water resources in arid regions is more outstanding (Yao,1995; Rosenzweig et al., 2001; Keellings and Waylen,2012; Ye et al.,2013; Huang et al., 2016; Yu and Sun,2019). Therefore, studying the characteristics of temperature extremes especially in the arid inland river basin with serious water shortage problem is crucial to local agricultural economic development, water resources distribution and ecological civilization construction.

As an important tool for climate simulation and projection, Global Climate Models (GCMs) have been developed rapidly in recent years (Li etal.,2012; Xu and Xu,2012a,b; Yao et al.,2012; Chen and Sun,2013; Wang et al.,2018; Li et al.,2020). The Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) driven by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) has strongly promoted the development of climate models.In phase 5 of CMIP(CMIP5) new scenarios characterized by RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are adopted, including RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. RCPs are a series of integrated concentration and emission scenarios, which are used as input parameters of climate change projection model under the influence of human activities in the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century. RCP8.5 will cause the largest magnitude of temperature rise; RCP4.5 is a climate scenario under government intervention,and it is the only emission scenario of cultivated land reduction.In view that the research focus on the temperature extremes,we chose the ${ \tt R C P 4 . 5 }$ and RCP8.5.Lots of studies have evaluated the performance of the CMIP5 models in simulating climatic variability (Hu et al.,2014; Chen et al.,2019). Although the GCMs have remarkable developments,the spatial resolution of them is still limited, and the simulations and projections have much uncertainties and there might be biases associated with dataset, which can further propagate into model results (Chen et al.,2012; Su et al. 2016; Sun et al., 2016). Studies showed that MME (Multi-Model Ensemble) could reduce the uncertainty of future climate projection (Almazroui et al.,20l6,2017a,b).For one thing, the simulation results of MME were closer to observations than most single models; for another, MME by the weighted ensemble method could reduce the uncertainty of estimation. Other studies also pointed out that preferred models outperformed general models in simulation capacity,and PM-PLS (Partial Least Square ensemble mean participated by Preferred Models) had better effect in projection (Xu et al., 2007; Raisanen and Ylhaisi, 2011; Jiang and Wu, 2013; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).

High resolution data can be obtained by appropriate downscaled methods for simulation and projection research (Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Raghavan et al., 2018). Raghavan et al. (2018) simulated and evaluated the future climate variation of Southeast Asia with statistical downscaled data and concluded that the NEX-GDDP (NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections) data were in good consistency with the observation data. How is the NEXGDDP used in China, especially in less gauged Northwest China? What data can we use to verify the reliability of NEX-GDDP? The CNo5.1 grid dataset developed and maintained by Chinese scientists are supposed to be accurate and reliable because they are interpolated from more than 2400 weather stations and more strictly constrained by surface observations (Xu et al., 2009; Wu and Gao,2013). In this study, we used CN05.1 to evaluate the accuracy of NEX-GDDP data.

The Kaidu-Kongqi River basin is an inland river basin in the arid region of Northwest China. It is very sensitive to climate change and the signals of global warming have long been found there (Shi et al.,2O02). However, it hasn't been known quite clearly what the future climate there will be. Although a few studies have been done to explore it, there was litle detailed research about temperature extremes in the basin (He et al., 2018;Li et al.,2019a, b). High-resolution future climate information, including mean condition and extreme condition,is appealed to help scientific research and policy making. This paper takes the Kaidu-Kongqi River basin as the study area and adopts CNo5.1 and NEX-GDDP data to simulate and analyze the future temperature extremes, i.e., Tmax (maximum temperature) and Tmin (minimum temperature), in the basin. Firstly, we selected the models with strong simulation ability in simulating air temperature of the basin from 21 models of NEX-GDDP as preferred models and form the MME. Secondly, we simulated and evaluated the selected single models and MME in temporal and spatial variation based on the historical data. Thirdly,we analyzed the future temperature extremes change in the study area by using the preferred MME (i.e., Partial Least Squares regression non-equal weighted ensemble mean). The objective of this study is to validate the applicability of NEX-GDDP dataset in the study area and to provide a projection of temperature extremes, expecting to help basin managers in water, land and agricultural resources planning and management.

# 2.2 Data

# 2.2.1 Observation data

The observation data is from CN05.1 dataset (Xu et al., 2009; Wu and Gao,2013), which includes a series of precipitation, mean temperature, Tmax and Tmin dataset at daily scale with spatial resolution of $0 . 2 5 ~ \deg \times 0 . 2 5$ deg $2 5 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ by $2 5 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ ). It is established by anomaly approximation method based on the measured data from more than 2400 weather stations in China. In this paper, the Tmax and Tmin data were used. The period is from 1961 to 2005.

# 2.2.2 Simulation data

The NEX-GDDP dataset (https://cds.nccs.nasa.gov/nex-gddp/) includes downscaled projections for $\mathsf { R C P 4 . 5 }$ and RCP8.5 from the 21 models (Table 1) and scenarios for which daily scenarios were produced and distributed under CMIP5.Each of the climate projections includes daily Tmax,Tmin and precipitation for the period 1950-2100.The spatial resolution of the dataset is $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { d e g } { \times } 0 . 2 5$ deg. This study used the daily Tmax and Tmin.The historical data from 1961 to 2005 was used for simulation evaluationï¼Œand the projected data from 202O to 205O was used to analyze the temperature extremes.

# 2.3 Historical climate simulation performance metric

To facilitate validation of the GCMs against the observational data, we simply averaged the temperature values to define the regionally averaged monthly and annual time series and spatial paterns of GCM simulations and observations.The annual Tmax and Tmin were calculated as the deviations from the climatology during the period 1961-2005.To quantify the agreement between observations and model simulations, we constructed Taylor diagrams (Taylor 2Oo1),for which we calculated the correlation coefficients, STD (standard deviations) and RMSE (root mean square errorsï¼‰ between the CMIP5 models' datasets and the observational datasets.We calculated the trends using linear trend estimation. Partial least squares ensemble mean was employed to calculate and solve the situation where the projection results are unsatisfactory due to the multi-collinearity among independent variables, making the information more in-depth and richer (Zhi et al., 2016).

# 3Results and discussion

# 3.1 Evaluation of model performance

# 3.1.1 Preferred model selection

In this paper, the two ensemble means participated by all models are called EE (equal-weight ensemble mean) and PLS (Partial Least Square),respectively, according to the two different ways of determining weights. The two ensemble means participated by preferred models are calld PMEE(equal-weight ensemble mean participated by preferred models) and PM-PLS,respectively. The screening criteria for preferred models in this paper are as follows:

The simulated air temperature of the models shows an increasing trend, passing the significance test of $1 \%$ ï¼Œ   
The correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed annual mean Tmax and Tmin time series passes the significance test of $1 \%$ ï¼š

According to the standards above,4 and 17 preferred models are selected for Tmax and Tmin, respectively (Table 2). The models, BCC-CSM1-1 and MPI-ESM-LR,have the closest linear trend values to the observations with the increasing rates (both $0 . 1 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { I }$ decade) slightly higher than that of observed ( $0 . 1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ /decade),but they didn't pass the significance test. The correlation coefficients of the models, ACCESS1-0, CSIRO-MK3-6-0, GFDL-ESM2M and NorESM1-M,are higher than others and both the linear trend and correlation coefficient have passed significance test.Therefore, these four models are used in the preferred MME,ie., PM-EE and PM-PLS for the Tmax.The performance of the models in simulating Tmin is obviously better than that in simulating Tmax either in trend size or in correlation coefcient.Besides the selected 4 models,the other 13 models, i.e., BCC-CSM1-1, BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR,MIROC5,MIROC-ESM, MPI-ESM-MR,are used for Tmin.

3.1.2Simulation evaluation based on Taylor diagram The agreement between model-simulated and observed temperature is further evaluated through the Taylor diagrams.Figure 2 shows the results for the climatology difference of different models in the entire historical period. Based on a comparison of the Taylor diagrams for temporal variability, most of the models have the similar ability to simulate the temperature time series,and different models show some differences.Most of the models can simulate the variability of Tmax well, with a $\mathrm { R M S E } { > } 0 . 6 1$ and a close match to CNo5.1 observations.The difference between the simulation results of Tmin is the correlation coefficient,ranging from 0.42 to 0.69,which indicates that some models had better simulation ability. In general, CSIRO-MK3-6-0, GFDL-ESM2M and NorESM1-M perform somewhat better for both Tmax and Tmin.

For the MMEs, the temperature simulation results are close to the observed values,the correlation coefficient of Tmax is between 0.47 and 0.61,the RMSE is 0.44-0.48,and the STD is larger than the observed value,ranging from O.31 to O.44; the correlation coefficient of Tmin is between 0.80 and 0.83,the RMSE is 0.42-0.46,the STD range is the same as Tmax.The results of Tmax have similar characteristics,and that is large deviation from the observed values.In general, the simulation performance of MME is better than that of single models.

# 3.2 Simulation and evaluation in temporal variation

It can be seen from Table 2 and Figure 3 that the Tmax and Tmin in the basin have shown a significant increasing trend in the past $4 5 \mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ï¼Œand all the single models and MMEs indicate this change trend.

In terms of Tmax, the simulated increasing rates of the most models and the four MMEs $( 0 . 1 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } -$ $0 . 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } /$ decade) are higher than that observed ( $0 . 1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \iota$ decade) (Table 2; Fig. 3). That is to say, the most models overestimate the historical change in Tmax (Fig.3a). The main reason is that the most models cannot simulate the downtrend before the mid-1980s but instead replace it with an uptrend or short downtrend, which magnifies the overall growth trend. The selected preferred models cannot overcome this, either (Fig.3b), but after applying the MME mean method,the results are improved greatly (Fig.3c).The four MMEs show very similar variations from 196l to 20o5.However,EE and

PM-EE overestimate Tmax significantly.PLS and PM-PLS are close to the observation curve. In comparison, PM-PLS outperforms PLS in simulating the peaks and valleys better.

As to the Tmin in the basin, the increasing rates of all the models ( $0 . 1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } /$ decade- $. 0 . 3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ /decade) including single models and MMEs are lower than that of observed $( 0 . 4 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ /decade) (Table 2). In other words,all the models underestimate the historical change of Tmin in increasing rate. However, the simulated values are greater than the observed values (Fig. 3d).That is because there is a big gap between the early simulation values and the observed values,resulting in the whole gently increasing rate. Thus, the increasing rate alone cannot tell whether the temperature are overestimated or underestimated. Compared to Tmax, Tmin has larger increasing rates (Table 2), meaning Tmin increased stronger than Tmax, which are consistent with the results of most studies (Zhao at al.,2014; Sun et al.,2016; Shang et al.,2018). Similarly,EE and PM-EE overestimate Tmin significantly.Both PLS and PM-PLS are close to the observation curve,but they cannot well depict the change in peaks and valleys due to the smooth effect caused by too much preferred models participated in.

# 3.3 Simulation and evaluation in spatial variation

In Figure 4,according to the observed results (Fig. 4a), the annual mean Tmax is between $- 0 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $2 1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ï¼Œ showing a gradually increasing trend from northwest to southeast with the altitude decreasing. All the models can capture the spatial distribution characteristics. For the

MME, both PM-EE and PM-PLS can well reproduce the distribution range of the Tmax (Fig. 4c and e), but PM-PLS has a closer result of spatial distribution pattern to that of observation.

The annual average Tmin changes from $- 1 3 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $6 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 4b), which can be shown in most of the models,and it shows the similar spatial distribution characteristics as that of the Tmax. Specially,a smallarea located in the middle of the basin is found to be colder than the adjacent area, which could be the result ofcold island effect exerted by the Bosten Lake (Fig.1).As to the MME, PM-EE can simulate the overall characteristics of Tmin, but it performs poorly in representing the specific distribution in plain and mountainous area. For example,large area of high values in the south does not tellthe true characteristics of the Bosten Lake around (Fig. 4d). In contrast, PM-PLS has a relatively better simulation result with the spatial correlation coeficient approaching to 1.0.

Figure 5 shows the spatial correlation coefficient distribution of Tmax and Tmin between PMEE,PM-PLS and the observed. Generally,the flatter and simpler the region,the better the simulation effect. High-resolution models can better reflect the steep topographic features of the high-altitude area and eliminate the high deviations that exist, thus improving the simulation capability (Jiang et al., 2O16). Based on the spatial simulation results (Fig. 5),we can draw that Tmin has a better simulation performance than Tmax and PM-PLS is better than PM-EE in exhibiting the spatial distribution of temperature extremes.

# 3.4 Future temperature projection

# 3.4.1 Temperature in temporal change

Based on the evaluation results,PM-PLS is adopted to estimate the future change in the temperature extremes of the basin. In Figure 6,it shows that Tmax under RCP4.5 willincrease as a whole during 2020-2050 with an increasing rate of $0 . 2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } /$ decade (Fig.6a),higher than that of the historical period ( $\mathrm { { ( 0 . 1 6 ^ { \circ } C } }$ /decade) and half of that under RCP8.5( $\mathrm { 0 . 4 8 ^ { \circ } C } /$ decade) (Fig. 6c). The fluctuation range ( $( 1 4 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 1 6 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ and the annual mean (about $1 5 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \$ ï¼‰of Tmax under RCP4.5 closely approximate that under RCP8.5, meaning that the large difference in RCPs will not necessarily cause marked difference in the basic characteristics of Tmax in short-term. They differ in two specific aspects. One is the fluctuation period; the former will fluctuate violently after 2030 and the latter will do before 2O40. The other is the increasing trend; the former will not increase continuously but jump from one stage to another with no obvious growth within each stage, while

the latter will increase almost continuously.

As for Tmin, the increasing rates under RCP4.5 (Fig. 6b) and RCP8.5 (Fig. 6d) are $0 . 3 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ /decade and $0 . 5 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ /decade,respectivelyï¼Œ higher than those of Tmax under the corresponding RCPs, indicating that Tmin will keep contributing more to global warming than Tmax as before.However, the increasing rate of Tmin under RCP4.5 is found lower than that of the historical period ï¼ˆ202 $( 0 . 4 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } /$ decade). In addition, there will be a ten-year warming hiatus since 2O35.All these indicate that the moderate emission scenario can relieve warming to some extent. In contrast, Tmin under RCP8.5 will keep continuous increase and approach to $2 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at the mid- $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century.

# 3.4.2Analysis of temperature in spatial change

Tmax under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 reveals the same spatial distribution characteristics that temperature is low at the northwest part ranging from $0 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $9 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and high at the southeast part hovering from $1 4 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 3 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig. 7a and b). There is no obvious difference between the two scenarios in short-term. Compared to the baseline period, however, they behave differently. The increment of temperature is $1 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { - } 1 . 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for mountainous area and $1 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ for plain area under RCP4.5 (Fig.7c),and it is $1 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - 2 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ and $1 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - 2 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ , respectively, under RCP8.5 (Fig. 7d). Tmax will increase under both RCPs in the whole basin. In comparison, the increment of temperature is larger in mountainous area and lower in plain area with the emission concentration increased.That is to say,Tmax in the mountainous area is more susceptible to be afected by the increased emission concentration.

In terms of Tmin, it shows almost the same spatial distribution characteristics as Tmax (Fig. 8a and b). Similarly, there is no difference between the two RCPs.Tmin ranges from $- 9 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $- 3 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at the northwest mountainous area and from $0 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $6 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at the southeast plain area. Compared to the baseline period, the increment of temperature is $1 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - } 1 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for mountainous area and $1 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - 2 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ for plain area under RCP4.5 (Fig. 8c),and it is $1 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { - } 1 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - 2 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ ï¼Œ respectively, under RCP8.5 (Fig. 8d). Tmin willincrease under both RCPs in the whole basin. The increments of temperature are large in both mountainous area and plain area with the emission concentration increased. So,the impact of increased emission concentration on Tmin is universal in the basin.

# 4 Conclusions

The present paper analyzed the temperature extremes of the Kaidu-Konqi River basin during $2 0 2 0 -$ 2050.Both the Tmax and Tmin under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 will increase in the future. The increasing rates of Tmin willbe larger than those of Tmax under each corresponding RCP.The spatial distribution characteristics of Tmax and Tmin under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 will overall the same in short-term,that is,the temperature in northwest is low and in southeast is high.The increment of Tmax and Tmin will be larger in plain area than that in mountainous area.

Temperature extremes are the important indicators of global warming,and analyzing them is helpful for us to know climate change. In this paper, the observed dataset verified the accuracy of selected models and the reliability of ensemble mean. However, the MMEs used in this paper were produced by only two simple methods,i.e., PM-EE,and PM-PLS.So far there is no good way to solve the problem of scientifically determine the distribution of weights. It needs our further study. Currently, CMIP6 has updated a number of climate model data,it is recommended to use the latest data for further research. In addition, the study mainly used the statistical downscaled data,and its spatial resolution is still coarse,which restricts the accuracy and reliability of simulation and projection. Combined using dynamic and statistical downscaled data will be a try in the future.
