# 1.Introduction

Li-ion battery batteries have been applied in a variety of portable electronic devices and are being pursued as power sources for hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles [1,2]. Commercially available Li-ion batteries utilize an intercalation-based graphite anode coupled witha lithium-transition metal oxide orphosphate cathode.The graphite anode with a theoretical capacity of $3 7 2 \ \mathrm { m A h \ } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ cannot enable the creation of batteries that achieve the high energy density required for vehicles and other emerging applications,which has motivated research into new high-capacity anode materials.A significantadvance in the field comeswith the discovery of materials that operate via a conversion reaction.3dtransition metal compounds $\mathrm { M _ { x } X _ { y } }$ 中 $\mathbf { \dot { M } } = \mathbf { C } \mathbf { 0 }$ ,Fe,Ni, Cu,etc.; ${ \sf X } = { \sf F } , 0$ S,N,etc.) based on the conversion reaction have now been widely investigated for their potential use in Li-ion batteries because of their high capacities [3].In these materials,transition metal sulfides,such as ZnS,CuS and $\mathsf { M o S } _ { 2 }$ ,have beenwidely studied during the past few decades because of their unusual physicochemical properties [4-7].In particular,copper sulfides including CuS, $\mathbf { C u } _ { 1 . 7 5 } \mathrm { S } , \mathbf { C u } _ { 1 . 8 } \mathrm { S } , \mathbf { C u } _ { 1 . 9 5 } \mathrm { S }$ and $\mathtt { C u } _ { 2 } \mathtt { S }$ are of great interest with potential applications ranging from energy storage,owing to their variations in stoichiometric compositions,complex structures,nanocrystalline morphologies,and valence states [7-1O].Amongthem, covellite CuS with a high electrical conductivity $( 1 \bar { 0 } ^ { - 3 } { \mathsf { S } } { \mathsf { c m } } ^ { - 1 } ) .$ anda high theoretical capacity $( 5 6 0 \mathrm { ~ m A h ~ g ^ { - 1 } } ;$ )with flat discharge curves when cycled versus $\mathrm { L i ^ { + } / L i }$ ,has been studied as cathode material for Li-ion batteries [11-13].However, the challenge of CuS used as electrodes in Li-ion batteries is the rapid drop in capacity and the formation of lithium polysulfides,which dissolve into electrolyte and drift away from the electrode.Hence,the cycle stability isa key issue for CuS used as an electrode material in Li-ion batteries.To overcome the issue,many attempts have focused on the synthesis of various nanostructures of CuS,including flowers [14-16], complex hierarchical nanostructure [17-22],one-dimensional nanostructure [23-25]. All these nanoscale morphologies somewhat improves the electrochemical performance of CuS electrodes due to their nanostructure,which can increase reaction sites,short the path of ion motion,and improve efficient charge transport.However,the preparation techniques involved mostly template-based, surfactant-directed,or interface methods.These growth methods usually require the use of special instruments,surfactants,or templates,which will increase the difficulty of operation,the cost, and contamination. In the present work,uniform small sized of sub- $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m \ C u S }$ rods were prepared via a facile sol-gel method without using template and complicated post-treatment. This method utilizes low temperature,no protective gas and cheap chemicals that make our method advantageous.Meanwhile,the electrochemical properties of as-prepared CuS nanorods as an anodematerial were investigated for Li-ionbatteries.

# 2.Experimental

# 2.1.Chemicals

Copperacetate monohydrate (analytical reagent (AR)),pyridine (AR),and sodium sulfide nonahydrate(AR) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.The electrolyte was purchased from Guo Tai Hua Long Company, including $1 \mathrm { M L i P F _ { 6 } }$ in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate(DMC)(1:1 by volume).All chemicals were used without further purification.

# 2.2.Synthesis of the CuS nanorods

In a typical synthesis, $5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m m o l }$ of copper acetate monohydrate was dissolved into $4 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m L }$ distilled water/pyridine mixture $( \boldsymbol { \mathsf { v } } ; \boldsymbol { \mathsf { v } } = 1 ; 3 ^ { \cdot }$ )andheatedto $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ 5.0 mmol of sodium sulfide nonahydratewasdissolved into $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of distilled water.Then,sodium sulfide solution was dropped into copper acetate solution under vigorous stirring.Finally, the mixture reacted for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The final products was collected and washed several times by distilled water or other solvents (e.g.,ethanol,pyridine),and then dried in a vacuum at $6 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ：

# 2.3.Material characterization

The phase composition of the as-prepared CuS samples was characterized by usinga Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (XRD) with $\operatorname { C u } \operatorname { K } \alpha$ radiation,at 20 range of $2 0 ^ { \circ } - 7 0 ^ { \circ }$ with 0.02 per step. The morphology and size of CuS nanorods were determined by FEI Tecnai F2O transmission electron microscope（TEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).Raman spectra were measured usinga Renishaw in Via-reflex spectrometer with the $5 3 2 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ line of the Ar ion laser as an excitation source in a quasibackscattering configuration.

# 2.4.Electrochemical measurement

The as-prepared CuS nanorods were studied as anode materials for Li-ion batteries.The CuS electrodes were prepared by dispersing $7 0 \mathrm { \ u t . } \%$ active materials,20 wt.% conductive carbon,and 10 wt.% poly(vinylidenefluride)(PVDF) binder in1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) to stir for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ to forma homogeneous slurry.The slurry was coated onto copper foil, dried at $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ in a vacuum oven for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and cut into $1 / 2$ in.diameter electrodes for testing.The amount of material on the Cu foil was in the range of $1 { - } 2 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ ,thus the active material loading was calculated to be ca. $0 . 7 \mathrm { - } 1 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ Li foils and polypropylene films were used as counter electrodes and separators,respectively.The electrolyte was $1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ L i P F } _ { 6 }$ in a mixture of ethylene carbonate(EC)and dimethyl carbonate(DMC)(1:1 by volume).The galvanostatic chargeand discharge testswere carried out at a constant current between O.O1 and $3 . 0 \mathrm { V }$ using a battery tester.Cyclic voltammetry(CV）was performed at a scan rate of $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { \ m V } ~ \mathrm { \ s } ^ { - 1 }$ within the range of $_ { 0 . 0 1 - 3 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ using an Autolab PGSTAT3o2N(Metrohm,Switzerland).Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS）measurements were collected by an Autolab8371O impedance analyzer,usinganalternating current with an amplitude voltage of $5 \mathrm { m V }$ in the frequency range of $0 . 1 { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { K H z }$ to CuS electrodes before and after 3 cycles.

# 3.Resultsanddiscussion

Fig.1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared CuS nanorods. All diffraction peaks can be indexed to the hexagonal covellite CuS structure,and no impurity phase can be detected,indicating the formation of pure CuS.The sharp difraction peaks suggest that the obtained CuS particles were highly crystalline.To be emphasized, the disappearance of the（1O7）diffraction peak from the XRD pattern indicated preferentially orientation effects of the growth direction along the（11O) plane of hexagonal CuS [26]. The broadeningof the diffraction peaksalso indicates that the products have small size.

Fig.2 shows TEM images of the as-prepared CuS at a high magnification，together with the corresponding scanning EDX analysis.The Raman spectrum of CuS isalso plotted in Fig.2.The CuS particles were irregularly shaped in rods with size less than $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and aggregated together,as shown in Fig.2a.A highresolution transmission electron(HR-TEM) image(Fig.2b) clearly shows that the particle was single crystal with clear interplanar distances of $0 . 2 8 \mathrm { n m }$ ,corresponding to that of the(103)plane of the hexagonal covellite CuS.EDX analysis (Fig.2c) reveals that copper and sulfur elements were detected and theiratomic ratio was close to 1:1,which agrees with the stoichiometric ratio of CuS.Raman spectroscopy was employed to further characterize the overall symmetry of the as-prepared CuS nanorods,as shown in Fig.2d.A distinct peak wavenumber around $4 6 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ is ascribed to S-S stretching vibrational mode of the covellite system [27].

The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared CuS nanorods asananode material in $1 ~ \mathrm { M } \mathrm { L i P F } _ { 6 } / \mathrm { E C } + \mathrm { D M C }$ electrolyteare shown in Fig.3.Fig.3a shows the charge-discharge profiles of the CuS electrode for the first,second,third,tenth,fiftieth,and hundredth cycle at a constant current rate of $0 . 2 \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ （ $1 { \mathsf { C } } = 5 6 0 \ \mathrm { m A h } \ \mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 } .$ ).The initial discharge and charge capacities were 775 and $5 6 1 \ \mathrm { m A h \ g ^ { - 1 } }$ respectively. The initial discharge capacity was larger than the theoretical capacity $( 5 6 0 \mathrm { ~ m A h ~ g ^ { - 1 } } ^ { \cdot }$ )dueto the formationof a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI),which was also reported in previous literatures [28,29].After the second cycle,the charge and discharge reaction proceeded reversibly and the irreversible capacity was small,although the discharge capacity decreased slowly.It can be seen from Fig.3a that the charge/discharge reaction process consisted of two main steps.During the discharge process,a slope plateauataround $2 . 1 \mathrm { \ V }$ was observed,and the second plateau was found at about $1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { V }$ ,followed by a long slope until cutoff voltage (0.01 V).However,these two plateaus became shorterand shifted to higher voltages of 1.9 and $2 . 4 \ : \forall$ ,respectively,during the charge process.To verify the electrochemical reactions,CV measurements were preformed with Li metal as the counter electrode in the voltage range of $0 . 0 1 { - } 3 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ at the scan rate of $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m V } \ s ^ { - 1 }$ (Fig. 3b). Two pair of distinct redox current peaks can be clearly observed from the CV curves.Similar results have been reported for CuS electrode in previous literatures [3O].During the first cycle,the oxidation peakswere located at ${ \sim } 1 . 9$ and ${ \sim } 2 . 4 \ V$ ,whereas the corresponding reduction peaks were observed at ${ \sim } 2 . 1$ and $\displaystyle { \sim } 1 . 7 ~ \mathrm { V } .$ These indicated that discharging reactions occurred at around 1.9 and $2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { V }$ and that peaks for the charging reactions appeared at around 2.1 and $1 . 7 \ : \mathrm { V }$ ，which coincides with the discharge-charge curves in Fig.3a.From the second cycle,all the peaks decreased gradually,especially for the oxidation peak at around $2 . 4 \mathrm { V }$ and the reduction peak at round $2 . 1 ~ \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ ，corresponding to the plateau changes between the 1st and 2nd cycle (Fig.3a).Furthermore, two reduction peaks occurred at about 2.1 and $1 . 7 \mathrm { V }$ were attributed to lithiation of CuS and $\mathtt { L i _ { x } C u S }$ ,respectively,while the oxidation peaks at 1.9 and $2 . 4 \ : \mathrm { V }$ were attributed to reverse reactions [10].

Fig.3c shows the cycling performance of ${ \mathsf { C u S } }$ electrodes at a constant current of $0 . 2 \mathsf { C } ( 1 \mathsf { C } = 5 6 0 \mathsf { m A } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } ,$ . As shown in Fig.3c,the capacity of CuS nanorods decreased gradually in the first 1O cycles, and then stabilized at ${ \sim } 3 9 0 \ \mathrm { m A h } \ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ with a small fluctuation up to 250cycles.Furthermore,this novel CuS anode showed an initial Coulombic efficiency of $6 9 . 8 \%$ ，which increased to ${ \sim } 9 0 . 1 \%$ at the second cycle,and further increased to ${ \sim } 9 7 . 2 \%$ at the 10th cycle,and finallystabilizedat ${ \sim } 9 9 . 1 \%$ in subsequent cycles.To the best of our knowledge,it demonstratesa much longer cycle life than that previously reported for CuS electrode,indicated that the CuS nanorods can bea promising electrode material forLi-ion batteries.

In additional to high capacity and excellent cyclability, the CuS nanorods also exhibit a good rate capability,as shown in Fig.3d. The rate capability of CuS nanorods was studied using the galvanostatic charge/discharge tests.The current rate increased from O.1 C to ${ 5 . 0 } \mathsf { C } _ { \mathrm { { \scriptscriptstyle } } }$ ,seven cycleswere recorded for each stepwise increment. When the current density was $0 . 1 ~ \mathsf { C } ,$ the $\mathtt { C u S }$ anode showed a reversible capacity of ${ \sim } 4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m A h } \ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ .Although the capacity graduallydecreased while the current rate increased from $_ { 0 . 1 \mathsf { C } }$ to $5 . 0 { \mathrm { C } } ,$ the CuS electrode still has a capacity of ${ \sim } 1 8 2 \ \mathrm { m A h } \ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at a high current rate of $5 . 0 { \mathsf { C } }$ Moreover,when the rate returned to the initial $0 . 1 \mathsf { C } ,$ the CuS electrode recovered its capacity of ${ \sim } 4 1 0 \ \mathrm { m A h } \ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ .The long-cycle life and high rate performance of CuS nanorods were strongly related to the advantages as following:（1） the unique structure of sub- $\cdot 1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ nanorods can provide effective accommodation of the strain during cycling, shorten the path of ion motion, enhance eficient charge transport,and accelerate the rate of chemical and energy transformation processes;(2） the intrinsic characteristic of CuS with good electronic conductivity can significantly improve its performance [30,31].

EIS was carried out to compare the CuS samples as the working electrodes versus Li before and after 3 cycles.Fig.4 shows Nyquist plots of the CuS cells before and after 3 cycles.Itwas apparently seen that the impedance spectrum is composed ofa semicircle at high-to-medium frequency region,and a straight sloping line at low frequency region.Similar large semicircles in both cases indicated that both have a similar charge transfer resistance $\mathrm { ^ { \prime } \mathbf { R } _ { c t } , }$ relating the charge transfer through the electrode/electrolyte interface) of $\mathtt { C u S }$ .This phenomenon can support the superior performance in Li-ion batteries,especially for the excellent cyclability (Fig.3).However, the slope of lines at low frequency region,which corresponds to Warburg impedance ( $\mathrm { . } \mathrm { ~ Z } _ { \mathrm { w } } ,$ relating to the diffusion of lithium ions in the electrode),was different before and after cycling. For the change of the slope before and after cycling,the main reason could be rooted in the conversion reaction of CuS nanorods after lithiation and delithiation,resulting in the bulk structural rearrangement that greatly differs from the pristine one.Therefore, the changed slope that corresponds to Warburg impedance is reasonable.

# 4. Conclusion

In summary,we developed a facile solution approach to fabricate CuS nanorods with the size less than $1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .Our method which used cheap chemicals and processed in low temperature without protective gas was promising for mass production.The as-prepared CuS nanorods were used as anode materials exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in Li-ion batteries.The unique structure of CuS nanorods should be responsible for the enhanced performance,including high reversible capacity,high coulombic efficiency,great capacity retention,and superior rate capability.
