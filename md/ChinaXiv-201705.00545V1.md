Chuanyao Liu,Qian Liu and Aisheng Huang\*

A superhydrophobic zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZlF-9O) with high steam stability is prepared through post-functionalization via anamine condensation reaction.The developed superhydrophobic ZIF-90 is highly promising as an effective and reusable adsorbent for bio-alcohol recovery.

Due to the emerging scarcity of fossil resources and critical environmentconcerns,the developmentof renewable and clean energy sources such as bioalcohols has drawn increasing interest in recent years.1 Bioalcohols are usually produced from biomass through fermentation with a low alcohol concentration in an aqueous medium.Therefore,it is a prerequisite to extract and recover the bioalcohol from the fermentation broth before it can be used as a biofuel. Distillation is a conventional technology for the separation of an alcohol/water mixture.However, it involves high energy consuming boiling and condensing processes. Adsorptive separation using porous materials is regarded as one of the most competitive methods as it is energy-saving and environmentally friendly. So far,various materials including activated carbons，polymeric resins and zeolites have been developed for the separation of alcohol/water mixtures.2-6 However, these adsorbents have a strong affinity to water,resulting in a low adsorption capacityand effectiveness.Therefore,the development of a novel adsorbent with high adsorption performance remains an urgent challenge.

In the past ten years,metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have received considerable interest because of their potential applications in gas adsorption and storage,membrane separation,chemical sensors,and drug delivery.7-12 In particular,zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs),a subfamily ofMOFs based on transition metals and imidazolate linkers,13,14 have emerged as a novel type of porous material for the fabrication of molecular sieving membranes due to their zeolite-like properties such as permanent porosity,uniform pore size,and exceptional thermal and chemical stability.15-21 Furthermore, ZIFs are also promising adsorbents for the recovery of bio-alcohols due to their tunable pore size and adjustable internal surface properties.22,23 It is well recognized that the adsorption performances of the adsorbents are determined not onlyby their open pore structures and surface areas,but also their hydrophobicity.3,24 Therefore,the development of superhydrophobic absorbents with open pore structures,high stability and large surface areas is of special interest.To the best of our knowledge,so far no studies on the synthesis and application of superhydrophobic ZIFs have been reported.

Recently,Yaghi and co-workers have developed a novel SOD topology ZIF-9o through a solvothermal reaction of zinc(11) and imidazolate-2-carboxyaldehyde (ICA).25 ZIF-90 shows not only a high stability but also a permanent microporosity with a narrow pore size $( \sim 3 . 5 \ \mathring \mathrm { A } )$ and high BET surface area $\left( 1 2 7 0 \mathrm { ~ m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ g } ^ { - 1 } \right)$ The presence of free aldehyde groups in the ZIF-9o framework allows the covalent functionalization of ZIF-9o with amine groups via an imine condensation reaction.Based on the imine condensation reaction，we have developed a covalent postfunctionalization strategy to enhance the molecular sieve performances of the ZIF-90 membrane.26,27 Indeed, the postsynthetic modification of MOFs iswell known as an effective and versatile strategy to improve the physical and chemical properties.28-32 Due to the presence of the free aldehyde groups in the ZIF-9o framework,ZIF-9o is an ideal candidate for the post-functionalization through host-guest reactions,generating a large number of topologically identical but functionally diverse ZIF-9o with fine-tuned and optimized properties.25-29 In the present work, we report the synthesis of a superhydrophobic ZIF-9o for bioalcohol recovery through the post-functionalization of ZIF-90 with pentafluorobenzylamine via an amine condensation reaction (Fig.1and Fig.S1,ESIt).It is expected that the fluorinated ZIF-9O will show a high hydrophobicity and thus is promising for bioalcohol recovery.

Pentafluorobenzylamine was synthesized according to a procedure reported elsewhere with minor modification (Fig. S2, the details see ESIt). The formation of pentafluorobenzylamine is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and $\mathbf { \Omega } ^ { 1 } \mathbf { H } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { N M R }$ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Fig.S3, $\mathrm { E S I \dag }$ ).The ZIF-90 wasprepared bya solvothermal reaction of zinc(I1) nitrate tetrahydrate,sodium formate,and ICAinmethanol.34As shown in Fig.2a，well-defined ZIF-9o crystals with a dodecahedral morphology and size of about $2 . 0 \pm 0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ are prepared after solvothermal synthesis for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $8 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .For the covalent postfunctionalization,the as-prepared ZIF-9o crystals were immersed ina solution of pentafluorobenzylamine in methanol,and then refluxed for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ The post-functionalization of ZIF-9o with pentafluorobenzylamine was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy and X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).As shown in Fig. S4 $\bigl ( \mathrm { E S I } \dag \bigr )$ the $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ band of the aldehyde at $1 6 7 8 ~ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ is replaced by the $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { N }$ bond of the imine at $1 6 3 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ .The presence of an aromatic $\mathbf { C } { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { C }$ band at $1 5 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ and $\mathbf { F } { - } \mathbf { C }$ bands at 1030,1125, and $1 2 3 5 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ suggests that pentafluorobenzylamine has been grafted on the ZIF-90 after post-modification.As shown in Fig.S5 and Table S1 $\bigl ( \mathrm { E S I } \dag \bigr )$ ，after post-modification,the intensity of the O 1s and $\mathtt { Z n 2 p }$ peaksreduces greatlyand a newF1s peak emerges withahigh intensity,confirming that pentafluorobenzylamine has successfully reacted with the aldehyde groups of ZIF-9o. Since the kinetic diameters of pentafluorobenzylamine are much larger than the pore size of ZIF-9o,it is difficult for pentafluorobenzylamine to go into the ZIF-90 cage.Therefore, the post-synthetic modification reaction mainly occurs at the external surface of the ZIF-90 particles,as shown in Fig.S6 $\left( \mathrm { E S I \dag } \right)$ .35 The successful postfunctionalization of ZIF-9o was further confirmed by ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption isotherms.As shown in Fig. S7a $\left( \mathrm { E S I \dag } \right)$ ,the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption isotherm for ZIF-9o showed a steep rise in the low-pressure region, indicating the permanent porosity of the ZIF-9o framework.25 The calculated BET surface area of ZIF-90 in the present work is about $1 1 8 2 ~ \mathrm { ~ m } ^ { 2 } ~ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ，which is in good agreement with the previous report.25 However,after post-functionalization， the pore aperture of the fluorinated ZIF-9o is severely constricted, leading to a low ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption (Fig. S7b, $\mathrm { E S I \dag }$ )

Fig.2FESEM images of ZIF-90 (a) and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 (b), XRD patterns of ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 (c),and measurement of the contact angle with water for the superhydrophobic ZIF-90 (d).

After post-functionalization,no remarkable differences in the ZIF-9o morphology are found between the as-prepared and the fluorinated ZIF-9o (Fig. 2b).As deduced from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig.2c),the high crystallinity of the ZIF-90 structure remains unchanged after post-modification, even after being boiled in water for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ (Fig. S8,ESIt).Furthermore, from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S9,ESIt), both the as-prepared and fluorinated ZIF-9o show a similar plateau region without a significant weight loss in the temperature range of $8 0 - 3 0 0 \ { } ^ { \circ } { \bf C } ,$ ，even after the measurement of the water stability (Fig.S1o,ESIt).These results indicate that the fluorinated ZIF-90 shows a high thermal and chemical stability.

The hydrophobicity of the fluorinated ZIF-90 was evaluated by measurement of the water contact angle (CA).As shown in Fig.2d, the surface of the fluorinated ZIF-9o shows a water CA of about $1 5 2 . 4 ^ { \circ }$ ,while the water CA of the surface of the as-prepared ZIF-90 is $9 3 . 9 ^ { \circ }$ (Fig. S11, $\mathrm { E S I \dag }$ ),suggesting that the hydrophobicity of the ZIF-9o can be significantly enhanced through postfunctionalizationwith pentafluorobenzylamine.Sucha surface superhydrophobicity should be attributed to the cooperation of both the microporous morphological structures and strongly hydrophobic chemical compositions of the fluorinated ZIF-9o,which are two well-known key factors for the surface superhydrophobicity.24,36

The hydrophobicity of the fluorinated ZIF-9o was further confirmed by the removal of alcohols from alcohol/water mixtures. To evaluate the adsorption capacity of the fluorinated ZIF-90 for the recovery of alcohols from alcohol/water mixtures,the super hydrophobic ZIF-9o powders were added into an ethanol/water mixture which was dyed with red oil for clarity,and then kept stirring for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ .Afterselective adsorption of ethanol for $2 0 \mathrm { h }$ ,the fluorinated ZIF-9o powders which had adsorbed ethanol were separated by a simple filtration.As shown in Fig.S12c $\left( \mathrm { E S I \dag } \right)$ the mother solution becomes colourless and transparent after the removal of the fluorinated ZIF-9o powders by filtration, indicating that ethanol has been fully recovered and removed by the fluorinated ZIF-9o.Indeed,according to the analysis of the gas chromatograph (GC), $9 8 \%$ ethanol has been removed from the ethanol/water mixture (Fig.3). On the contrary,only $7 \%$ ethanol can be removed from the ethanol/water mixture when using the as-prepared ZIF-9o as the adsorbent (Fig. S13, ESIt).Besides ethanol, the superhydrophobic ZIF-9o also displays high adsorptive separation performances for the removal of other bioalcohols such as methanol, iso-propanol and butanol,as well as its mixtures (Fig.3). Furthermore,the superhydrophobic ZIF-90 canbe easilyregenerated bya simple thermal regeneration under vacuum at $6 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,and the superhydrophobic ZIF-90 is still highly active after five successive cycles of separation due to its high stability，with an almost constant alcohol removal percentage (Fig.S13,ESIt).From the TGA measurement of the superhydro phobic ZIF-9o which has fullyadsorbed ethanol,a similar plateau region without a significant weight loss in the temperature range of $8 0 - 3 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is still observed,and the initial weight loss is about $2 0 \%$ at $3 0 \mathrm { - } 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ due to the release of ethanol (Fig. S14,ESIt). These results are in good agreement with our supposition that the superhydrophobic ZIF-9o is very promising for use as an effective and reusable adsorbent for bio-alcohol recovery from aqueous solutions.

In conclusion,based on an amine condensation reaction between the aldehyde groups of ZIF-9o and amine groups of pentafluorobenzylamine,we have developed a facile postfunctionalization route for the preparation of superhydrophobic ZIF-90.After post-functionalization, the water CA can be enhanced from $9 3 . 9 ^ { \circ }$ to $1 5 2 . 4 ^ { \circ }$ ，while both the dodecahedral morphology and SOD structure of ZIF-9o remain unchanged due to its high stability.The developed superhydrophobic ZIF-9o displays a high adsorptive separation performance for the recovery of bio-alcohols. At $2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，more than $9 8 \%$ bio-alcohol (ethanol, iso-propanol and butanol) can be recovered and removed from the bio-alcohol/water mixture.These properties present the superhydrophobic ZIF-90 as a promising candidate for industrial bio-alcohol recovery.

Preparation of pentalfluorobenzylamine: Pentalfluorobenzylamine was synthesized according to the chemical reaction shown in Fig. S2 with the procedure reported elsewhere with minor modification. 1 Typically, $\mathrm { B H } _ { 3 }$ ·THF (1 M; $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ , 25 mmol) was carefully added into pentafluorobenzonitrile ( $\mathrm { ~ ( ~ 1 ~ g , ~ 5 . 1 8 ~ }$ mmol) anhydrous THF ( $\mathrm { \nabla } 8 0 \ \mathrm { m l } ,$ ） solution in a round bottom flask at $2 9 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ under stirring condition. Then the resulting mixture was refluxed (373 K) and stirred for $1 0 \mathrm { { h } }$ . After reaction, the mixture was cooled to $2 7 3 \mathrm { K }$ ,and 2.6 M HCl ( $\mathrm { i } 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ ) was carefully added into the mixture. And then, the resulting mixture was continued to reflux for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ . The resultant solution was evaporated under vacuum to remove THF with conventional rotary evaporation method. Excessve HCl solution was added to the residue and then extracted with diethyl ether ( $( 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l } )$ ） for 3 times. The water phase was treated with $10 \%$ NaOH aqueous until the pH reached to $1 0 \sim 1 1$ , and then extracted with excessive diethyl ether ( $\mathrm { i 0 0 m l }$ for 3 times. The combined organic phase was washed thoroughly with sodium chloride solution, and then dried over with $\mathrm { N a } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ . The solvent was removed under vacuum and light yellow liquid was obtained, which was used without further purification. The formation of pentalfluorobenzylamine was confirmed by fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectoscopy and $\mathrm { ^ 1 H }$ -NMR nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The FT-IR spectoscopy was achieved in the absorbance mode in a Bruker Tensor 27 spectro photometer. The NMR spectroscopy was obtained at ambient temperature using a Bruker 400 MHz instrument (NMR

Switzerland Bruker 400MHz AVANCE II). The signals are presented relative to TMS as 0 ppm,and CDCl3 was used for solvent.

Synthesis of ZIF-90: ZIF-90 crystals were synthesized by solvothermal method in a Teflon-lined autoclave according to the procedure reported elsewhere. ² Normally, a solid mixture of $0 . 2 9 6 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ (1.00 mmol) zinc nitrate hexahydrate, $0 . 3 8 4 \mathrm { g } \left( 4 . 0 0 \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ imidazole-2-formaldehyde and $0 . 0 6 8 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } ( 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { m m o l } )$ （20 sodium formate was dissolved in $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ methanol by ultrasonic treatment. The as-prepared solution was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave,and heated at $8 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in an air-circulating oven for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ After solvothermal reaction and cooling to $2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ， the ZIF-9O crystals was filtered and washed with methanol three times,and then dried in air for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ at room temperature.

Synthesis of superhydrophobic ZIF-9o: The as-synthesized ZIF-9O crystals ( $\left( 0 . 1 5 ~ \mathrm { g } , 0 . 5 9 ~ \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ （204号 and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ pentalfluorobenzylamine (0.347g, 1.76 mmol） were suspended in methanol solution， and refluxed at $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ . And then the solid was filtered and washed with fresh methanol ( $( 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L } )$ ）three times to obtain superhydrophobic ZIF-90 crystals. Finally, the superhydrophobic ZIF-90 crystals were dried under vacuum ( $1 0 ^ { - 2 }$ Torr) for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ at room temperature.

Characterization of as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90: The morphology of the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 was characterized by field emisson scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). FESEM micrographs were taken on an S-4800 (Hitachi) with a cold field emission gun operating at $4  { \mathrm { \ k V } }$ and $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { A }$ . The phase purity and crystallinity of the as-synthesized ZIF90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 was confirmed by $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ -ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were recorded at room temperature under ambient conditions with Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation at $4 0 ~ \mathrm { \ k V }$ and $4 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m A }$ . FT-IR spectra of the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 were obtained by using Bruker TENSOR27 Impact spectrometer. The superhydrophobic performance of the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 was evaluated by water contact angle (CA). The water contact angle was measured with a Dataphysics OCA20 contactangle system at room temperature under ambient conditions. Water droplets (about $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { L } }$ ）were dropped carefully onto the surface of the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 crystals. The contact angle value for each sample was obtained by measuring four different positions of the same sample and averaging them to get the final contact angle value.

Thermal and hydrothermal stability measurement of the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90: The thermal stability of the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 was measured by Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). TGA was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA/STDA 851e. Samples ( $\mathrm { \Delta } \cdot \mathrm { \Delta } 1 0 \ \mathrm { m g } )$ placed in $7 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ alumina pans were heated in an air flow from 0 to $9 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with a heating rate of $5 \mathrm { { ^ { o } C / m i n } }$

The as-synthesized ZIF-90 and fluorinated ZIF-90 crystals were boiled in water for testing their thermal stability. The as-synthesized ZIF-90 and fluorinated ZIF-90 crystals $( 0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { g } )$ were respectively added into water $( 1 \ \mathrm { g } )$ , and then were placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 100 $^ \mathrm { { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ in an air-circulating oven for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ . After the treatment in boilling water, the as-prepared ZIF-90 and fluorinated ZIF-90 crystals were separated by filtration.

Adsorptive separation of alcohols/water mixture by using the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90: To evaluate the adsorption capacity of the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-9O for the recovery of alcohols from alcohol/water mixtures, the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 powders $( 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { g } )$ were added into $10 \mathrm { w t \% }$ ethanol/water mixture (5.0 g) which was dyed by red oil for clarity, and then keeping stirring for $2 \textrm { h }$ ， After a following selective adsorption of ethanol for $2 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ , the as-synthesized ZIF-90 and superhydrophobic ZIF-90 powders which have adsorbed ethanol were separated by a simple filtration. After filtration. the obtained supernatants was analyized by liquid chromatography to determine the relative content of ethanol. Before and after adding the superhydrophobic ZIF-90 powders, the compositions of the alcohol/water mixture were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-1690T, Jiedao). The alcohol removal percentage was used to evaluate the adsorptive separation performance of the the superhydrophobic ZIF-90.The alcohol removal percentage was calculated using the following equation:

R _ { a l c o h o l } = ( 1 - \frac { W t ( a l c o h o l ) _ { f i n a l } } { W t ( a l c o h o l ) _ { i n i t i a l } } ) \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

Where Wt(alcohol)inial and Wt(alcohol)fnal are the initial alcohol weight and final alcohol weight of the alcohol/water mixture, respectively.
