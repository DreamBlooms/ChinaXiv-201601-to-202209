# ABSTRACT

Ozone treatment is a common way to functionalize commercial multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs）with various oxygen functionalities like carboxyl, phenol and lactone groups,in order to enhance their textural properties and chemical activity. In order to detail the effect of each functional group，we correlated the activity with the surface density of each group,and found that the carboxyl groups play a pivotal role in two important catalytic reactions, namely the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and agar conversion to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). During the processes, the hydrophilic surface provides a strong affinity for reaction substrates while the improved porosity allows the eficient diffusion of reactants and products. Furthermore, the activity of functionalized CNTs for agar conversion remained almost unchanged during nine cycles of reaction. This work highlights a strategy for improving the activity of CNTs for electrochemical ORR and agar conversion reactions,as well a promising application of carboxyl-rich CNTs as a solid acid catalyst to produce high-purity HMF—an important chemical intermediate.

# 1 Introduction

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted tremendous interest in many important fields such as catalysis, fuel cells, lithium batteries,composite materials and electric devices [1-3]. Surface functionalization with oxygen,nitrogen and other heteroatoms has proved to be an efficient way to significantly improve the performance of CNTs due to the enhanced compatibilityand surface reactivity.For instance,a variety of surface oxygen groups can play a key role in many heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions. Zhang et al. [4] proposed that ketonic $C { = } 0$ groups can abstract hydrogen atoms from the $\mathrm { C - H }$ bands of alkanes to produce the corresponding alkenes and Aguilar et al. [5] found that alkaline ketone/benzoquinone groups asactive sites were responsible for the oxidation of aqueous ammonia. In addition, the carboxyl group has been suggested to be the active site for phenol oxidation [6]. Oxygen functional groups on carbon have also been reported as participating in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [7-10]. After incorporating a number of acidic components such as sulfonic acid groups, carbon materials have been found to display a high activity for the conversion of biomass into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)—an important chemical intermediate for the synthesis of biopolymer materials [11-13].However, despite many studies of the effect of functional groups on CNTs in catalysis, the effect of a specific group on the catalytic turnover is still unclear. In particular, although the carboxyl group has a high acid strength there have been no reports of itsuse in electrochemical oxygen reduction and biomass conversion—two attractive topics in the field of sustainable chemistry.

In this work, commercial multi-walled CNTs were treated by a diluted flow of ozone to grow various oxygen functional groups. The distribution of oxygen containing groups was quantified by $\mathsf { X }$ -rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the Boehm titration method,and the activities forelectrochemical ORR and agar conversion to HMF were evaluated. Furthermore, these activities were correlated with the distribution ofoxygen functional groups to investigate the structure-performance relationship.We were delighted to observe the key role of the carboxyl groups in both reactions,and the results may provide a clear clue to optimize the structure of carbon catalysts and promote further fundamental research into metal-free catalysis.

# 2 Experimental

# 2.1 Materials

The pristine multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) prepared by a chemical vapor deposition method (purity 97.5 $\mathrm { w t . \% , }$ average diameter $1 2 . 9 \mathrm { n m }$ length $3 { \mathrm { - } } 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m } ,$ were supplied by Shandong Dazhan Nanomaterials Co., Ltd., China. The ozone was produced by an $\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ generator (WH-H-Y, WAOHUANG OZONE Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Co., China) using pure oxygen as the gas supply.

# 2.2 Functionalization of MWCNTs with ozone oxidation

Generally, the pristine CNTs $( 2 \mathrm { g } )$ were placed into a quartz boat inside a tube furnace. Ozone ${ ( 3 . 6 ~ \mathrm { v o l . \% } }$ in an $\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ mixture) with a flow rate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ was continuously passed through the reactor chamber at different temperatures $( 2 5 - 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ．The oxidation process was carried out for $2 \mathrm { h }$ and the functionalized samplesare denotedas CNT- $x ,$ in which $x$ represents thetreatment temperature in Celsius degree.

# 2.3 Characterization

The overall oxygen content of each sample was evaluated by an organic elemental analyzer (OEA) (HORIBA EMGA-620W). XPS tests were carried out on an AXIS ULTRADLD Multifunctional $\mathsf { X }$ -ray photoelectron spectroscope with an Al $\mathrm { K } \alpha$ radiation source at room temperature and under a vacuum of $1 0 ^ { - 7 } \mathrm { P a }$ 0 $1 0 ^ { - 9 }$ Torr). The starting angle of the photoelectrons was set at $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ . The spectrum was calibrated with reference to the C1s peak at $2 4 8 . 6 \mathrm { e V } .$ ， $\Nu _ { 2 }$ adsorption/desorption isothermsat $7 7 \mathrm { K }$ were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument after outgassing samples at $8 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ prior to analysis.The specific surface areas were calculated with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation. The pore size distributions (PSD) were obtained by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method using the desorption branch of the isotherms.

# 2.4 Boehm titration

The amount of oxygen functional groups was quantified by the Boehm titration method [14,15]. The number of various groups was calculated under the following assumptions: NaOH can neutralize lactone, carboxyl and phenol groups; ${ \mathrm { N a } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 3 }$ can neutralize both lactone and carboxyl groups; ${ \mathrm { N a H C O } } _ { 3 }$ can only neutralize carboxyl groups. The difference between the uptakes of the bases can be used to quantify each specific oxygen group. A mass of ca. $0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g }$ sample was added to one of three bases (25.0 mL, 0.03 M): ${ \mathrm { N a H C O } } _ { 3 } ,$ ${ \mathrm { N a } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { N a O H } ,$ which were analytical grade reagents $( > 9 9 . 0 \% ,$ Sinopharm Chemical Reagent $C _ { 0 }$ ： Ltd).The solution was agitated for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ and then filtered to remove the samples. The filtrate was titrated by hydrochloric acid (Sinopharm, $0 . 0 3 { \bf M } )$ （2 with degassing by pure $\Nu _ { 2 }$ to ensure complete $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ expulsion.During the titration,the $\mathrm { \ p H }$ change was recorded and the endpoint was determined from the first derivative of the pH-volume plot.

# 2.5 Cyclic voltammetry (CV)

All electrochemical tests were carried out witha CHI 760Eelectrochemistry workstation (Shanghai CH Instruments, China) and a conventional three-electrode test cell at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Thecounterand reference electrodes were a graphitic rod and a $3 \mathrm { M } \mathrm { A g } / \mathrm { A g C l } ,$ respectively. The glassy carbon disk was polished with $3 0 \mathrm { n m }$ alumina powder, sonicated and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol before use. The homogeneous catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing a mixture of $1 \mathrm { m g }$ of catalyst, $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of a 5 wt.% Nafion solution in alcohol, and $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } O . 5 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of catalyst ink was subsequently pipetted and spread on a $3 \mathrm { m m }$ -diameter pre-cleaned glassy carbon disk as the working electrode.All electrolyte solutions were deaeratedbyultrapure $\Nu _ { 2 }$ forat least $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ prior to anymeasurement. To evaluate the catalytic activity for ORR,the cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in $0 . 1 \mathrm { M } \mathrm { K O H }$ solution saturated with ultrapure $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ $\mathrm { \Omega _ { 2 } } ( 2 0 \mathrm { { m L } \cdot \mathrm { { m i n } ^ { - 1 } ) } }$ at a scan rate of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m V } { \cdot } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ ：

# 2.6Rotating disc electrode (RDE) experiments

A working electrode was fabricated by pasting a $2 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ aliquot of the catalyst ink prepared as above on a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode ( $5 \mathrm { m m }$ in diameter, from PINE Instruments, USA),yielding an approximate catalyst loading of $4 0 \mu \mathrm { g }$ ，The electrolyte was $0 . 1 \mathrm { m o l } { \cdot } \mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ KOH solution, the counter and the reference electrodes were an artificial graphite electrode and $\mathrm { \ A g / A g C l }$ electrode, respectively. Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) tests were performed at rotation speeds of $1 { , } 6 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ in an $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -saturated electrolyteat a sweeprate of $1 0 \mathrm { m V } { \cdot } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ ：

# 2.7 Conversion of agar to HMF

In a typical run, agar $( 0 . 1 2 5 \ : \mathrm { g } )$ was dissolved in $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of deionized water, giving a solution of agar with a concentration of $7 9 { \mathrm { g } } { \cdot } { \mathrm { L } } ^ { - 1 }$ ，Then，catalyst $( 0 . 1 \mathrm { g } )$ was added and reaction mixture washeated to $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a closed reactor with an oil bath,and the conditions were maintained for a given reaction time. After the desired reaction time elapsed，the water loss was complemented. The solution was separated by centrifugation at $5 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent ZORBAX).In the recyclability tests， the separated catalyst was washed by deionized water for the next cycle.Also,the performance of acetic acid (AC) for agar conversion was compared. $2 \mathrm { m L }$ of AC with different concentrations of $1 0 0 \%$ 1 $5 0 \%$ and $0 . 2 5 \%$ was mixed with $0 . 1 2 5 \mathrm { g }$ of agar，with the subsequent operations carried out as above.

# 3 Results and discussion

# 3.1 Oxygen analysis

We first prepared a variety of CNT samples with different amounts of each functional group.The solution-free ozone treatment isaclean and effective way to introduce various oxygen-containing functional groups onto the carbon materials,which mainly produces $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $_ \mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ [16]. We employed the diluted ozone to oxidize CNTs at different temperatures $( 2 5 - 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The oxygen contents of the samples were determined by OEA and XPS analysis.As shown in Fig.1(a), the trends in various oxygen group contents measured by the two techniques are almost consistent with each other. Note that the oxygen contents measured by XPS are somewhat higher than those measured by OEA,which may reflect the fact that XPS is a surface analysis technique. The pristine CNTs possessed quite low oxygen content of 1.24 and $0 . 2 4 ~ \mathrm { w t . \% }$ as measured by XPS and OEA, respectively. After treatment at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (CNT-25), the oxygen contents sharply increased to 7.8 and $4 . 8 \ \mathrm { w t . \% } ,$ respectively. When the temperature was elevated to $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (CNT-40), a maximum in oxygen content $( 8 . 3 ~ \mathrm { w t . \% }$ measured by XPS) was obtained. However, the oxygen content suddenly dropped to $2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { \ w t . \% }$ (OEA）at a higher temperature of $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (CNT-5O),and finally decreased to $0 . 4 1 \mathrm { w t . \% }$ (OEA) at $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (CNT-200).A reasonable explanation for this is that the increased rate of decomposition of ozone to oxygen at higher temperatures reduced the efficiency of oxidation. This was verified by blank experiments withouta CNT sample, which showed that the ozone decomposition became significant above $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (see Fig.S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM)).

Figure1(a) Oxygen contents of all CNTs determined by XPS and OEA;(b) Concentrations of oxygen functional groups of all samples determined by Boehm titration.

In the XPS surveys of all samples (Fig.S2 in the ESM),no Fe signal was observed while C1s and O1s were present.The oxygen functional groups on carbon materials are generally distinguished and quantified by deconvolution of the high-resolution C1s or O1s XPS spectra,which may introduce arbitrary errors and lead to incorrect estimates of the populations of different oxygen functional groups [17]. In this work, we used the Boehm titration method to provide a more convincing and quantitative measure of the relative amounts of the different oxygen functional groups as shown in Fig. 1(b). To evaluate the possible disturbance of the residual metal catalyst particles contained in the CNTs framework,weused the ICPAAS method to analyze the amount of metal ions in the titration solution. The amount of Fe ions was below $1 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { \ m m o l { \cdot } g _ { C N T s } } ^ { - 1 } .$ ， giving a negligible error of less than $4 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { m m o l { \cdot } g _ { C N T s } } ^ { - 1 }$ during the calculation of total amount of oxygen functional groups.

The trend in the total concentration of the different oxygen functional groups approximately coincided with that of total oxygen content, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The concentration of phenol groups changed irregularly with increasing temperature. In contrast， the concentration of carboxyl groups sharply increased from 0.002 to $0 . 4 1 4 \mathrm { m m o l { \cdot } g ^ { - 1 } }$ as the temperature was raised to $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，Further increases in temperature suppressed the formation of carboxyl groups. An analogous phenomenon was observed by Alvarez et al.[18] in the ozone treatment of activated carbon, in which the amount of carboxyl groups produced was a maximum at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ rather than at $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ Razumovskii et al.[19] observed by electron spin resonance (ESR) that the reaction of ozone and a graphitic matrix generates peroxide radicals.The further reaction of peroxide radicals with carbon-hydrogen bonds in the graphitic matrix may generate hydrotrioxide intermediates,which transform into the carboxyl functional groups as proposed by Chiang et al. [20]. In this work, the carboxyl groups as fraction of the overall oxygen functional groups can reach as high as $5 7 . 8 \%$ at a treatment temperature of $5 0 ^ { \circ } C ,$ suggesting that the selective enrichment of carboxyl groups might be realized by optimizing the parameters of ozone treatment in the future.

# 3.2Textural characterization

The textural structure of CNTs,characterized by $\Nu _ { 2 }$ isothermal physical adsorption/desorption,was significantly affected by functionalization. For the CNTs treated by ozone below $5 0 ^ { \circ } C ,$ the BET surface areasignificantly increased (Fig.S3(a) in the ESM), and the optimal value of $3 2 9 . 7 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ was obtained for CNT-40 as compared with the lower value for pristine CNTs $( 2 1 9 . 1 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } )$ ).ThetrendinBET surface area is roughly coincident with that for the total concentration of oxygen functional groups,as shown in Fig. 1(b).

The effect of oxygen functional groups on the textural structure of CNTs is provided in detail by the profiles of pore size distribution (PSD) determined from $\Nu _ { 2 }$ isothermal desorption (Fig. S3(b) in the ESM). For all samples, including pristine and functionalized CNTs, thereisabroaddistributionbetween5and $1 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ with the most probable pore size centered at around $3 0 \mathrm { n m } ,$ ，which can be assigned to the splits between the bundles of CNTs.In the enlarged PSD profiles below $5 \mathrm { n m } .$ ，as shown in Fig.2(a)，there is a PSD peak at $3 \mathrm { n m }$ for all samples. These pores may be the apertures between the walls of the CNTs that are formed when they twist together [21] and are preserved on the CNTs treated by ozone.In addition,there is also a shoulder around $3 . 3 \mathrm { n m } ,$ .which became intense on the CNTs treated in the low temperature region of $2 5 \mathrm { - } 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C ,$ being related to the enhanced volume of poresbelow $5 \mathrm { n m }$ (Fig.S3(a) in the ESM). The variation in pore volume also roughly coincides with that of the total concentration of oxygen functional groups. It can therefore be deduced that the enhanced pore volume after functionalization may be derived from the repulsions of oxygen functional groups，which could enlarge the apertures between the walls of CNTs twisted together,and thus increase the BET surface area.

Figure2(a） Profiles of pore size distribution below $6 \mathrm { n m }$ determined by $\Nu _ { 2 }$ isothermal desorption;(b) linear relationships of the BET surface area and the volume of pores below $5 \mathrm { n m }$ with the total concentration of oxygen functional groups.

InFig.2(b),bothBET surface areaand the volume of pores below $5 \mathrm { n m }$ showed a roughly linear relationship with the overall amount of surface oxygen functional groups.The deviation of some points from the general trend may be due to the different weighting factors of the various functional groups. Therefore, two ternary linear regression models of the BET surface area (S) and volume of pores below 5 nm $( V )$ with the concentrations of carboxyl $( C _ { \mathrm { c a r b o x y l } } ) .$ phenol $( C _ { \mathrm { p h e n o l } } )$ and lactone $\scriptstyle \left( C _ { \mathrm { l a c t o n e } } \right)$ groups were obtained as follows:

$$
S = 1 8 0 . 0 4 C _ { \mathrm { c a r b o x y l } } + 1 9 5 . 2 8 C _ { \mathrm { p h e n o l } } + 5 9 . 8 2 C _ { \mathrm { l a c t o n e } } + 1 7 6 . 5 8
$$

$$
V = 0 . 1 2 C _ { \mathrm { c a r b o x y l } } + 0 . 0 7 C _ { \mathrm { p h e n o l } } - 0 . 0 4 C _ { \mathrm { l a c t o n e } } + 0 . 0 5
$$

In both Eqs.(1) and (2), the larger coefficients for $C _ { \mathrm { c a r b o x y l } }$ and $C _ { \mathrm { p h e n o l } }$ indicate the considerable contributions of carboxyl and phenol groups to the increased BET surface area and pore volume. This phenomenon can be understood since,unlike the lactone groups,both carboxyl and phenol groups are dangling on the surface of the CNTs.

# 3.3 ORR activity

Theelectrocatalytic capabilities of pristine and treated CNTs were evaluated for ORR by CV in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with $\Nu _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ In Figs.3(a) and 3(b),CNT-40 is taken as an example for comparison with the pristine CNTs. Under $\Nu _ { 2 }$ protection (Fig. 3(a)), the voltammetric currents of pristine CNTs showed a featureless curve,suggesting the absence of metal impurities on the surface [22]. The CV results for CNT-40 showed a significant increase in the area, indicating that the functionalization greatly improved the capacitance of CNTs. In the presence of $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ (Fig. 3(b)), ORR activities were observed for both samples. The pristine CNTs exhibited a well-defined peak at a potential of $- 0 . 3 5 \mathrm { V } ,$ while CNT-40 gave a peak at more positive potential (lower overpotential） of $- 0 . 2 6 \mathrm { V } ,$ suggesting an improved ORR activity.

![](images/cff5c7255f00a48c7754921b3e88effc8cb680267269862762e696bd001d2649.jpg)

The CV potentials, including onset potential and peak potential, of all CNTs are displayed in Fig. 3(c). The onset potential was determined by the intersection of the two tangents of the background and declining reduction currents [23] as shown in Fig.3(b).All treated CNTs,especially the CNTs treated between 25 and $5 0 ^ { \circ } C ,$ exhibited more positive CV potentials than the pristine CNTs. The most positive onset CV potential of $- 0 . 1 6 \mathrm { V }$ was observed for CNT-35，and the value is close to that for the sulfonic acid functionalized graphene nanoplatelets reported by Jeon et al. [24]. The ORR performances were also comparable to those of N-doped porous carbon materials [25] and some noble metals reported in the literature [26-29], indicating surface functionalization has great potential asa means to improve ORR activity (see Table S1 in the ESM).

Toeliminate the diffusion limitations in ORR,RDE experiments for LSV measurements were performed. The onset potential of an LSV curve (Fig.S4 in the ESM) is defined as the potential at which the ORR current is $5 \%$ of that measured at $- 0 . 3 { \mathrm { V } }$ [30],and the values are also displayed in Fig. 3(c). The trend in LSV onset potential approximately coincided with that for the CV potentials.

Figure 3(d) shows the linear relationships between the ORR potentials—including CV onset potential $( P _ { \mathrm { C V _ { \mathrm { - } } o n s e t } } ) _ { \mathrm { - } }$ ， CV peak potential $( P _ { \mathrm { C V _ { \mathrm { - } P e a k } } } )$ and LSV onset potential $( P _ { \mathrm { L S V \_ o n s e t } } )$ -and the concentration of carboxyl groups，with the overpotentials decreasing with increasing concentration of carboxyl groups.This can be further verified by the ternary linear regression models of the ORR potentials as a function of the concentrations of the three oxygen functional groups as follows:

In Eqs.(3)-(5), the larger coefficients of Ccarboxyl suggest that the contribution of the carboxyl groups to the improved ORR activity is larger than those of the other groups.

In the recent work of Jeon et al. [24], hydrogen-, carboxylic acid-，sulfonic acid-,and carboxylic acid/ sulfonic acid-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets were employed as electrocatalysts for ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. They found that the polar nature of the functional groups plays an important role in regulating the ORR efficiency,and proposed that the high polarity results in a strong affinity of the functional groups with the electrolyte and oxygen, thus inducing strong charge repulsions between the graphitic layers which allows efficient diffusion of oxygen. In this work,the dominant role of the carboxyl groups of CNTs in the improved ORR activity strongly supports their hypothesis. On the one hand, the high polarity of the carboxyl groups will enhance the surface hydrophilicity of CNTs.On the other hand，the presence of carboxyl groups and phenol groups may enlarge the apertures between the walls of CNTs twisted together. Both effects are beneficial to the electrochemical ORR activity of the CNTs.

# 3.4Agar conversion to HMF

Thepristine and treated CNTs were employed as the solid-acid catalysts for agar conversion to HMF. The catalytic activities of all the CNTs in agar conversion are shown in Fig. 4(a), in which the yield and selectivity of HMF were determined after reaction for $6 \mathrm { { h } }$ .A higherHMF yield wasobserved over the treated CNTs than that over the pristine CNTs.The CNTs treated between 25 and $5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ exhibited higher activity than others.Furthermore, the HMF yield is correlated to the amount of carboxyl groups and a linear relationship between them is observed,as shown in Fig.4(b). Undoubtedly, the carboxyl group is active for biomass conversion to HMF,which can be justified by the fact that carboxyl group possesses the strongest acid strength among the oxygen functional groups. A linearrelationship between the acid density of sulfonic groups with the activity for fructose conversion was also found by Liu et al. [12].

![](images/6741877af5b0fcdc383c601bb89ef53906cfed758e99771c6f17bf3d0ac5e17f.jpg)  
Figure 4(a) Yield and selectivity of HMF over all CNTs for agar conversion;(b) Liner relationship between the HMF yield and concentration of carboxyl groups on CNTs for agar conversions.

In order to get an insight into the catalytic role of the carboxyl groups, the activity of CNT-25 for agar conversion was compared with that of AC with different concentrations of $1 0 0 \%$ $5 0 \%$ and $0 . 2 5 \%$ in the reaction solution.Based on HMF yield,the activities decreased in the order: $5 0 \%$ （20 $\mathrm { A C } > 0 . 2 5 \%$ （204 $\mathrm { A C } > \mathrm { C N T } { - 2 5 }$ $>$ pure AC (Fig. S5 in the ESM). The lowest activity of pure AC (HMF yield $< 5 \%$ )maybe due to the low acidityassociatedwiththelimitedhydrolysisin the absence of water. Compared with $5 0 \%$ AC and $0 . 2 5 \%$ AC,the lower reactivity of CNT-25 may be attributed to an insufficient amount of carboxyl groups.

For clarification，the productivity of HMF was normalized to the concentration of carboxyl groups As shown in Fig. 5(a), the obtained specific productivity for $5 0 \%$ AC and pure AC were close to zero, implying that most of the carboxyl groups were not utilized. The specific productivity (Fig.5(a)） and selectivity (Fig. 5(b)) over CNT-25 were comparable to, or even slightly higher than, the corresponding values for $0 . 2 5 \%$ AC. This suggests the carboxyl groups on CNTs were fully utilized due to their high dispersion on the CNTs so that the material behaves like a homogeneous catalyst.As in the case of ORR, this can beattributed to the enhanced hydrophilicity and improved porosity afforded by functionalization. The former not only facilitates the dispersion of CNTs in the reaction system (aqueous solution) but also favors the affinity to the reaction substrates (agar),while the improved porosity enhances the diffusion of reaction substrates to the active sites,i.e., the carboxyl groups.

In addition, however, anchoring the carboxyl groups on CNTs offers the advantage of recyclability for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.Figure 5(c) indicates the catalytic efficiency of CNT-25 in repeated reaction cycles for agar conversion to HMF.Note that the HMF yield increased to $1 2 . 4 \%$ from $8 . 1 \%$ after the first reaction cycle. The lowerHMF yield in the first cycle might be attributed to the HMF produced being partly adsorbed on fresh CNTs.The HMF yield in the second reaction cycle was maintained in subsequent cycles until the tenth cycle. From the tenth cycle onwards，the HMF yield decreased slowly，which may due to the loss of CNT-25 in the separation and washing processes.

# 4 Conclusions

Oxygen-functionalized CNTs possess high activities for ORR and agar conversion to HMF.By correlation with the distribution of oxygen functional groups,it was found that the carboxyl groups play a pivotal role in the two catalytic processes.During the reaction, the enhanced hydrophilicityaffords a strongaffinity with the reaction substrates while the improved porosity allows efficient diffusion of reaction substrates. Furthermore, the functionalized CNTs displayed an outstanding recyclability in agar conversion,and the performance remained almost unchanged during nine cycles of reaction.In this work, the demonstration of the dominant effect of the carboxyl groups in ORR and agar conversion will guide our future efforts to develop carboxyl-rich CNTs as solid acid catalysts, especially for the production of high-purity HMF. However, the loss of CNTs powder during the posttreatment process also emphasizes the importance of producing monolithic CNTs with good mechanical stability before the industrialization of this catalytic process is possible.
