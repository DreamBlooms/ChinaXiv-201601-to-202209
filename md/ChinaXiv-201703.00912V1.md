KEYWORDS: Graphdiyne doping perovskite solar cell PCBM， electrical conductivity， interfacial coverage

rganic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted intense attention due to their large absorption coefficient,high charge carrier mobility,electron-hole diffusion length,easy fabrication, and low-cost.1-13 Great success has been attained by elevating the power conversion efficiency (PCE）to over $1 9 \%$ within several years since its birth.14 Following the absorption of incident photons，carriers are generated within the bulk of perovskite absorber.More importantly efficient charge extraction requires selective contacting of the perovskite layer with a positive (p）and a negative $\mathbf { \Sigma } ( \mathbf { n } )$ contact material.As we know, diffusion length of the electrons is shorter than that of the holes,which is a major limitation in enhancing PCEs of perovskite solar cels.15 Yang group achieved the higher PCE of $1 9 . 3 \%$ by building the interface engineering of electron transport layer (ETL).16 So it is very important to improve the electrons transport properties in perovskite solar cells. N-type organic molecule such as phenyl- $C _ { 6 1 }$ -butyricacid methyl ester $( \mathrm { P C B M } ) ^ { 1 7 }$ or metal oxides such as $\mathrm { Z n O , } ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } , ^ { 1 9 , 2 0 }$ and so forth are usually employed as the ETLs to achieve the higher efficiencies of perovskite solar cells.Among them,PCBM has already been intensively applied

in the $\mathrm { \Delta P - I - N }$ structure.21-23 However， there are several problematic issues such as low coverage，leakage currents, interfacial recombination,and so on needed to be resolved, which result in relatively poor photovoltaic performance. Therefore,doping or modification of the PCBM layer ought to be made to achieve higher photocurrents and better coverage for high-performance perovskite solar cells.

Carbon materials,24-26 such_as graphdiyne27-34 (GD), graphene,35,.36 graphene oxide,37and single-walled carbon nanotubes38,39 (SWNTs)，are emerging dopant in perovskite solar cells due to their unique conductivity advantages. Snaith group has applied graphene nanocomposites and carbon nanotube into perovskite solar cells as electron collection layerandobtained high PCE.38,39Unlikegraphite and graphene,GD possesses both sp- and $\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ -hybridized carbon atoms and natural holes， resulting in many interesting applications such as Li storage，oxygen reactions electronic devices，and catalyst $2 7 - 3 4$ Carbon networks of GD with delocalized $\pi$ -systems are of particular interest owing to the tenability of their properties with clever changes in their electronic, optic, and geometric characteristics.40 Recently, GD has been introduced into perovskite solar cells as a dopant into poly(3-hexylthiophene）(P3HT）working as hole-transporting material (HTM) for efective hole transport.41 GD displayed relatively strong $\pi { - } \pi$ stacking interaction between GD particles and P3HT,but detailed analysis of the increased short circuit current density $( J _ { s c } )$ was lacked.

In this work,for the first time we built the electron transport layer composed of PCBM doped with GD in planar heterojunction（PHJ） $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { P b I } _ { 3 - x } \mathrm { C l } _ { x }$ solar cells．This introduction of GD led to the improved performance of PHJ perovskite solar cells with the PCE increased from 13.5 to $1 4 . 8 \%$ and the $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ increased from 22.3 to $2 3 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ Itwas found that the doping GD not only increased electrical conductivity,electron mobility,and charge extraction ability in the ETL layer but also improved the ETL film coverage on perovskite layer that was very important for the data repeatability. Several measurements such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM)，conductive atomic force microscope (cAFM)，the space charge limited current (SCLC)，and photoluminescence (PL） were conducted to give detailed analysis of the improved device performances.The results indicated that the introduction of GD dopant into PHJ perovskite solar cells was an effective strategy for enhancing device performance.

Results and Discussion. The device structure of PHJ perovskite solar cells in this study was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ $\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } N H _ { 3 } P b I _ { 3 - x } C l _ { { x } } / P C B M : G D / C _ { { 6 0 } } / A l , }$ as shown in Figure la. The chemical structure of GD is presented on the right. The resultant current density $( J )$ -voltage $( V )$ characteristics based on this device structure under AM1.5 G conditions ( $\mathrm { \Delta } _ { 1 0 0 \mathrm { \ m W / \ell } }$ $\mathsf { c m } ^ { 2 } ,$ ）are displayed in Figure 1b and the relevant parameters were summarized in Table1 (reference devices basedon PCBM were also fabricated and measured).The control device based on pure PCBM interlayer exhibited a $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ of $2 2 . 3 \mathrm { \ m A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ an open-circuit voltage $( V _ { \mathrm { o c } } )$ of $0 . 9 8 9 \mathrm { V } ,$ a fill factor(FF) of 0.615 with a corresponding PCE of $1 3 . 6 \%$ (average PCE of $1 0 . 8 \%$ ） While the device using PCBM:GD as electron transport layer displayed a $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ of $2 3 . 4 \mathrm { \ m A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ a $V _ { \mathrm { o c } }$ of 0.969Vanda FF of 0.654，yielding a PCE of $1 4 . 8 \%$ (average PCE of $1 3 . 9 \%$ ） Corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE）spectra of this device and the control device were displayed in Figure 1b inset.The spectra showed the same tendency but different height corresponding to conductivity difference from GD doping. The band edge presented the same wavelength at ${ \sim } 7 7 5$ nm with the absorption edge of perovskite layer,as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).A remarkable higher average PCE of PCBM:GD-based devices was observed with $2 8 \%$ enhancement ( $1 3 . 9 \%$ VS $1 0 . 8 \%$ ）compared to thatbased on pure PCBM-based ones.The $V _ { \mathrm { o c } }$ values from PCBM:GDbased devices slightly decreased compared to control devices. Anapproximately $2 0 0 \mathrm { m V }$ surface potential decrease (Figure S2 in Supporting Information） in PCBM:GD film compared with that of pure PCBMfilm wasobserved,which may explain the declining $V _ { \mathrm { o c } } . ^ { 4 2 - 4 4 }$ However， both enhanced $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ and FF were observed from the PCBM:GD-based device.As expected, the enhancement of $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ was obvious due to the high conductivity of GD.

aThe average values were obtained from eight cels

In order to figure out whether the notable over $1 4 \%$ PCE for our device was reliable or not.The stabilized photocurrent output45-48of the optimal PCBM:GD baseddevice was measured held at a forward bias of $0 . 7 7 5 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ (voltage of the maximum power point).A steady-state PCE of $1 4 . 4 \%$ was obtained,as shown in Figure ld. Only a $2 . 7 \%$ drop in efficiency was observed, which outperformed other cells employing only dense- $\mathrm { \cdot T i O } _ { 2 }$ 48 This result indicated that the optimized PCE in our device wasreliable.

Furthermore,in order to exclude the experiment accidental errors,the statistical data of eight devices fabricated with pure PCBM and PCBM:GD electron transport layers were presentedinooaddlo respectively, as shown in Figure 2.This box plot has been widely used in perovskite solar cells for analyzing the statistical distributions of device parameters.As can be seen， the average $V _ { \mathrm { o c } }$ of PCBM:GD based devices was lower than that of control devices.The average $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ and FF of PCBM:GD based devices were higher than those of the pure PCBM-based ones. Moreover, the smaller standard deviation of device parameters for the PCBM:GD-based devices as compared with the control devices indicated a higher degree of reproducibility of the best performance devices,especially in the $J _ { \mathrm { s c . } }$ This results were in well agreement with the above ones.

As we all know，the morphology of perovskite layer and interlayer played an important role in achieving high performance of PHJ perovskite solar cell.50,51 So SEM measurements were performed,as shown in Figure 3.The perovskite layer in our devices exhibited larger grain and more compact morphology，which brought the favorable device performance in this study.After the perovskite layer was coated with the PCBM or PCBM:GD layer，the surfaces morphologies displayed slightly differences as shown in Figure $^ { 3 \mathrm { b } , \mathrm { c } }$ The rough perovskite layer became smoother when coated by PCBM:GD film than that coated by pure PCBM film.The graphdiyne may also help to passivate the grain-boundary of the perovskite and then reduce the trap states of the surface to eliminate the recombination.21 The improved morphology ensured efficient coverage of ETL together with smaller $R _ { s }$ (5.5 Vs $7 . 5 \Omega \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } ,$ ),explaining the improved FF in PCBM:GD-based devices.

To characterize the influence of GD-doping on the electronic property of PCBM film and figure out the origin of $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ increment, the conductivity of pure PCBMfilm and PCBM:GD film was examined by performing c-AFM measurements52,53 as described in Figure 4a,b.The c-AFM images of PCBM:GD flm clearly showed different current levels and distributions from pure PCBM film.Significantly increased vertical current was observed in the PCBM:GD flm. The result suggested the electrical conductivity of PCBM:GD increased upon GDdoping. This explained the $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ increment in some ways. However， this is not enough that the higher electrical conductivity of PCBM:GD films brought the higher $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ when used in perovskite devices.To further explore the origins of the enhanced $J _ { s c } ,$ the electron mobility was approximated using space charge limited current measurements54 in which device structures were $\mathrm { I T O / Z n O / P C B M }$ orPCBM:GD/Ca/Al.Then $J { - } V$ characteristics of single-carrier devices were measured.The results were plotted as $\mathrm { l n } \big ( J L ^ { 3 } / V ^ { 2 } \big )$ versus $( V / L ) ^ { 0 . 5 }$ by fitting to the Mott-Gurney law,as shown in Figure 4c.Electron mobility was calculated from the intercept of the corresponding lines on the axis of $\ln ( J L ^ { 3 } / V ^ { 2 } )$ . It is easy to obtain that electron mobility of pure PCBM based electron-only device was $2 . 9 8 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ $\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / ( \mathrm { V } \ s )$ ． After GD doping， the electron mobility of PCBM:GD based electron-only device increased to $5 . 3 2 \ \times \$ $1 0 ^ { - 4 } ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } / ( \mathrm { V } ~ s )$ . The result exhibited that the charge transport mobility of PCBM film was increased by GD doping.

In order to investigate if PCBM:GD film efficiently extract photogenerated carriers from the perovskite absorber， PL spectra were measured as well, as shown in Figure 4d.15,52 In our devices，PEDOT:PSS，as hole transport layer，and PCBM:GD，as electron transport layer，can extract photogenerated carriers.The PL of PEDOT:PSS/ $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { P b I } _ { 3 - x } \mathrm { C l } _ { x } ,$ PEDOT:PSS/ $\mathrm { ' C H _ { 3 } N H _ { 3 } P b I _ { 3 - x } C l _ { { x } } / P C B M _ { 3 } }$ ，and PEDOT:PSS/ $\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } N H _ { 3 } P b I _ { 3 - x } C l _ { { x } } / I }$ CBM:GD on glass substrates was measured.The excitation light entered the sample from the glass substrate side with excitation at $6 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，and PL spectra were collected.We observed a significant quenching effect when the perovskite layer was coated with either the PCBM:GD layer or the PCBM layer.ThePL of PCBM:GD-coated perovskite film was almost completely quenched.It indicated that PCBM:GD film extracted electron more efficiently，which may decrease charge recombination in devices.The result,as shown in Figure $3 \mathrm { a - d } ,$ ，demonstrated that doping GD into PCBM can increase electrical conductivity,electron mobility,and charge extraction ability in the ETL layer.Therefore，the enhanced $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ was attributed to all combined effectof these factors.

Recently，unexpected photocurrent hysteresis has been observed in the $J { - } V$ curves of perovskite solar cells,especially in the planar structure perovskitesolar cels $^ { 1 5 , 5 5 - 5 7 }$ Therefore, the $J { - } V$ curves of the devices with different scanning directions were recorded，as shown in Figure Sa,b.The PCE values obtained from the forward bias scan (forward bias to short circuit，FB-to-SC）and the reverse bias scan (short circuit to forward bias，SC-to-FB）of PCBM:GD based device were $1 4 . 8 \%$ and $1 3 . 9 \%$ ，respectively. Those of the PCBM-based device were $1 3 . 6 \%$ and $1 2 . 0 \%$ ，respectively.The difference of PCE values between forward bias scans and the reverse bias scan in PCBM:GD based devices is less than that of PCBMbased ones ( $0 . 9 \%$ VS $1 . 6 \%$ ).In addition，the $J { - } V$ curves of PCBM:GD based devices at different scanning rates with delay time ranging from S0,100,to $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ were also checked,as shown in Figure $\ r _ { s , \mathrm { d } }$ The $J { - } V$ curves of PCBM:GD based devices at different scanning rates almost overlapped with each

other while the pure PCBM-based devices showed a large difference at different scanning rates.These results indicated that the photocurrent hysteresis could be reduced to a certain extent by introducing GD in PCBM layer. The weaker photocurrent hysteresis in PCBM:GD based devices may be ascribed to the efficient coverage on perovskite layer and the improved electrical properties.

Conclusion. In conclusion, GD used as a dopant into PCBM ETL layer was successfully applied in PHJ $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { P b I } _ { 3 - x } \mathrm { C l } _ { x }$ solar cells for the first time.High efficiency of $1 4 . 8 \%$ ，stable power output $\ ( \mathrm { P C E } ~ = ~ 1 4 . 4 \% )$ ，and small hysteresis PHJ perovskite solar cells based on PCBM:GD ETL were demonstrated. The enhanced $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ and FF were observed from the PCBM:GD based devices. SEM measurement exhibited that the PCBM:GD based devices had better coverage on the rough perovskite layer,which indicated better interfacial contact and less chargerecombination.C-AFM, SCLC,and PL measurements further indicated that the introduction of GD into PCBM film could improve the electrical conductivity, electron mobility，and charge extraction.All these results explained the origin of enhanced $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ and FF.So the introduction of carbon materials such as GD into perovskite solar cell applications will become a simple and effective strategy for improving device performances in the future.

$\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ solution was prepared by dissolving $[ 6 , \bar { 6 } ]$ -phenyl$\mathrm { C } _ { 6 1 }$ -butyric acid methyl ester into chlorobenzene (CB,Aldrich) with a concentration of $2 0 \ : \mathrm { \ m g / m L }$ and stirred at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight in glovebox. The GD solution was prepared by dispersing $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of GD powder in CB and sonicated at $5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for more than $1 0 \mathrm { { h } }$ The $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M : G D }$ solution was prepared by mixing $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ solution $\mathrm { ( 2 0 ~ m g / m L ) }$ with $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of GD solution $( 1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L } )$ ）

Perovskite Precursor Preparation.To form the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { P b I } _ { 3 - x } \mathrm { C l } _ { x }$ precursor solution,MAI and $\mathrm { P b } { \mathrm { C l } } _ { 2 }$ (molar ratio 3:1） are dissolved in DMF with final concentrations $2 . 6 4$ M MAI and $0 . 8 8 \mathrm { ~ M ~ P b C l } _ { 2 }$ .This solution was stirred at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight in a $\Nu _ { 2 }$ -filled glovebox.Prior to device fabrication, the precursor solution was filtered twice with a $0 . 4 5 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ PTFE filter.

Device Fabrication. The perovskite solar cells were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (Shenzhen NanBo Group,China, $1 0 \Omega / { \mathrm { s q } } ,$ ）withthe following device configuration:ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { P b I } _ { 3 - x } \mathrm { C l } _ { x } /$ $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ or $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M : G D / C } _ { 6 0 } / \mathrm { A l }$ ．The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent,deionized water，acetone,and isopropyl alcohol for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ each and then dried with a nitrogen stream.Then the precleaned ITO glasses were moved into an ultraviolet (UV) chamber for UV-ozone treatment for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ A $3 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ thick PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto ITO at $4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $6 0 \mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ and then dried at $1 4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ in air.All substrates were transferred to the glovebox for further processing.Perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $4 5 \ { \mathrm { s . } }$ After spin-coating, the films were left to dry at room temperature for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ to allow slow solvent evaporation.They were then annealed on a hot plate in the glovebox at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to promote crystallization of the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { P b I } _ { 3 - x } \mathrm { C l } _ { x }$ perovskite and gave the thickness of ${ \sim } 5 0 0$ nm. The $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ or $\mathrm { P C } _ { 6 1 } \mathrm { B M : G D }$ layer was then spin-coated onto the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { P b I } _ { 3 - x } \mathrm { C l } _ { x }$ layer at $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $6 0 ~ \mathsf { s }$ Finally a $5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ thick $\mathrm { C } _ { 6 0 }$ and a $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ thick aluminum cathode (deposition rate of $1 . 0 \mathrm { \AA } / s )$ ）were deposited on the substrates through a shadow mask to give a device area of $0 . 0 6 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ under a vacuum level of $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ Torr.All device measurements were performed in an inert environment.

The illuminated current densityvoltage $\left( J - V \right)$ characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were recorded under ilumination and dark conditions using a computer-controlled Keithley 24oO source meter under AM 1.5G simulated solar light. The external quantum efficiency measurements were performed with the Newport IQE-200 Measurement System，which equipped a Xe lamp，a monochromator, a current-voltage preamplifier,and a lock-in amplifier. SEM imaging was conducted on S-48oo scanning electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 8 kV.c-AFM imaging was obtained at room temperature in contact mode by using a Veeco dimension $\mathrm { \Delta V }$ atomic microscope and the cantilever coated with $\mathrm { P t / I r }$ while applying a $_ { 5 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ bias.PL spectra were measured at room temperature by usinga fluorescent spectrophotometer (F-46oo,Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo,Japan） with a l5oW Xe lamp as an excitation source at room temperature.
