A $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathsf { B } )$ -CNT-graphene ternary composite material was prepared by in situ growth of ${ \mathsf { T i O } } _ { 2 } ( { \mathsf { B } } )$ ona conductive network composed of both graphene and CNTs. $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathsf { B } )$ has nanorod morphology and is dispersed uniformly in the carbon matrices. Graphene in this composite acts as sheet-like mini-current collectors that loads $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathsf { B } )$ ，whereas CNTs further enhance the electrical conductivity of $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathsf { B } )$ by intimate contact between the two components in local regions,and also prevent the restacking between graphene layers.The composite anode material exhibits a capacity of $1 9 0 ~ \mathsf { m A }$ h ${ \mathfrak { g } } ^ { - 1 }$ even after 200 cyclesat1 C, presenting excellent rate performance.

# Introduction

With rising interests in green electrode materials for lithiumion batteries (LIBs),increasing attention has been paid to titanium dioxide $\left( \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \right)$ anode material in recent years because of its long cycle life,low cost，and minimum environmental impact.1 However,anatase as the most widely studied polymorph of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ forLIBs still faces some challenges in practical applications mainly because of its low specific capacity. Luckily, $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ (bronze) as a relatively new polymorph of titania is able to accommodate $1 \mathrm { L i } ^ { + }$ per Ticorresponding to a high theoretical capacity of $3 3 5 \mathrm { \ m A h \ g ^ { - 1 } }$ $\mathbf { \dot { \bar { \rho } } } _ { \mathrm { T i O _ { 2 } ( B ) } }$ was first synthesized in 1980 byMarchand and co-workers from the layered titanate ${ \bf K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { T i } _ { 4 } { \bf O } _ { 9 }$ 3 ${ \bf K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { T i } _ { 4 } { \bf O } _ { 9 }$ was first converted to $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { T i } _ { 4 } \mathbf { O } _ { 9 }$ via $\mathbf { K } ^ { \dagger } / \mathbf { H } ^ { + }$ ion change and then calcinated to obtain $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ .However, the exploitation of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ as the anode material for Li-ion batteries was carried out in recent years. $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ with various structures has been synthesized,aiming to improve its electrochemical performance. $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ with ultra-small particle size $( 2 . 5 \times 4 . 3 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ was synthesized successfullyby Ren et al.,which had higher volu metric capacity thanall previously reported titania materials at rates above $1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { \ m A }$ h $\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ 4 Liu et al. prepared mesoporous $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ microspheres with diameters of $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ，which was composed of uniform nanosized crystal grains of ${ \sim } 6 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and mesopores of $1 2 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ in size,and showed superior rate performance than anatase nanoparticles under the same electrode fabrication and test conditions.' Shin et al. firstly reported a facile synthetic route for preparing skein shaped $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$

nanotube cluster particles withanultra-high surface area of 257 $\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,which exhibited outstanding rate capability as well as high specific capacity.6

It was reported that the insertion ofLi ions into $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ is governed by a pseudocapacitive faradaic process,which results in high rate charge/discharge capabilities.However, $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ still suffers from the extremely low electrical conductivity.A combination of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ with conducting agents,such as metals," metal oxides,and carbonaceous materials1° has been proved to be an effective strategy to enhance electron transport,which also can be applied to $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ .Graphene nanosheet,as a new type of 2D carbon nanomaterial, can improve the electrochemical performances of various electrode materials even at a low weight fraction owing to its high intrinsic electrical conductivity,high theoretical specific surface area $( 2 6 3 0 \mathrm { ~ m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ g } ^ { - 1 } )$ ,11 ultrathin thickness,chemical tolerance and excellent structural flexibility.12 Huang et al. reported a graphene $/ \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ hybrid with unique sheet-belt nanostructure through the hydrothermal treatment of commercial $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ powders with graphene oxide (GO） in NaOH solution,which presented a superior rate capacity.13 Zhang et al. prepared graphene-supported $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanosheets composite,which exhibited high rate performance.14 Vinodkumar Etacheri et al. proposed a simple photocatalytic reduction method to obtain chemically bonded $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanosheet/ RGO (reduced graphene oxide） composite，and excellent capacity stability was achieved even after 1ooo chargedischarge cycles at a rate of $4 0 \mathrm { C }$ 15 Li et al. introduced a simply way to fabricate $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ -graphene nanoscrolls and this hybrids present good rate capability.16 As shown in above,graphene can improve the electrical conductivity of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ ，and further improve the electrochemical performance.Therefore,good conductive network is the key to enhance the electrochemical performance of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ . Thus,it is necessary to well design a conductive network to fully bring out the performance of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$

Fig.1Schematic illustration for the synthesis of $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathsf { B } )$ -CNT-graphene composite.

In this paper，a novel $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } ) .$ -CNT-graphene ternary composite was designed and synthesized byan insitu growth procedure.The synthesis strategy for the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ -CNT-gra phene composite is schematically depicted in Fig.1.Firstly, titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) was added dropwise to the solution containing both GO and CNT.The hydrolysis of TTIP resulted in the formation of precipitation containing GO,CNT andamorphous $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ (the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -CNT-GO intermediates). Following hydrothermal treatment of the precipitation in solution and subsequent calcination gave rise to the formation of ternary composites containing $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods,CNT and reduced GO.In this composite,graphene sheets act as large conductive substrates,and CNTs bridge the defects for electron transfer between graphene layers and inhibit their aggrega tion,17 all together to form a large and continuous conductive network.The conductive network fabricated by graphene sheets and CNTs disperses uniformly all over the composite and has intimate contact with $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods,resulting in fast electron migration into the inner region of the electrode and the full access for the electrolytes into the electrode.The composites synthesizedin thiswaydeliveredahigherreversiblecapacity and exhibited better rate performance than pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$

# Experimental

# Samplepreparation

GO nanosheets were prepared according to the method we reported previously.18 CNTs were pretreated to be partially oxidized for better dispersion in water. Typically, $_ { 1 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of CNTs waspretreated in $7 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of ${ \bf H N O } _ { 3 }$ （204号 $( 6 8 \% )$ solution at $1 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $^ { 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ The $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -CNT-GO intermediates were synthesized by the following procedure.A small amount of GO nanosheets and 40 mg of the pretreated CNT were dispersed in $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of ethanol solution under bath ultrasonication for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Then $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) was dropwise added.After $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ of stirring, $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ ofammonium hydroxide was added,and the mixture was kept stirring under $3 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .The precipitate was then collected by fltration and washed with ethanol and deionized water repeatedly.Afterwards，the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -CNT-GO intermediateswere dispersed directly into $8 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of $1 0 \mathrm { M N a O H }$ aqueous solution under stirring,and then transferred into a $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ Teflon-coated autoclave,sealed and kept at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ . Thehydrothermally treated productwasdispersed in $^ { 1 \mathbf { M } }$ HCl solution at room temperature for 3 days. The acid solution wasrenewed every $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .Then the product was washed with deionized water until the solution pH reached ${ \sim } 7$ and air-dried at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The obtained nanocomposites were calcinated at $3 7 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 5 h }$ ，and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } ) .$ -CNT-graphene nanocomposites were finally obtained and named as $i \cdot$ TBCG in the following content for convenience.For comparison,pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ without graphene and CNT, $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \mathrm { \left( B \right) } /$ graphene composite without CNT and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \big ( \mathbf { B } \big ) / \mathrm { C N T }$ composite without graphene were also synthesized using the same procedure.

# Structuralcharacterizations

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using an AXs D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu $\kappa \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { a } }$ radiation; receiving slit, $0 . 2 \mathrm { m m }$ ； scintillation counter,40 mA; $4 0 \mathrm { k V }$ )from Bruker Inc.The morphology and structure were analyzed by a Hitachi S-48oo field emission scanning-electron microscope (SEM) and an FEI Tecnai G2F2O transmission-electron microscope (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { k V } .$ .The nitrogen sorption isotherms were recorded bya Micromeritics ASAP-2020 M nitrogen adsorption apparatus.Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Pyris Diamond thermogravimetric/ differential thermal analyzer by Perkin-Elmer.

# Electrochemicaltests

The evaluation of electrochemical performance was carried out in CR2o32-type coin cells.For the coin cells, the working electrode contained $8 0 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ of active materials, $1 0 \mathrm { \ : w t \% }$ of Super P, and $1 0 \mathrm { \ : w t \% }$ of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).The Li metal foil served as the counter electrode.The electrolyte was composed of1 $\mathbf { \Delta } _ { \mathbf { M L i P F } _ { 6 } }$ solution in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate（DMC） $( 1 : 1$ by volume). The coin cells were charged/discharged within the voltage range of $_ { 0 - 3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ using a LAND-CT2001A battery test system (JinnuoWuhan Corp., China) $\left( 1 ~ { \mathrm { C } } = 3 0 0 ~ { \mathrm { m A } } ~ { \mathrm { g } } ^ { - 1 } \right) $ .Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed using an Autolab $8 3 ~ 7 1 0$ electrochemical workstation.The impedance spectra were obtained by applying a sine wave.The amplitude is $\mathrm { 5 . 0 ~ m V }$ and the frequency ranges from $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k H z }$ to $0 . 0 1 \ \mathrm { H z }$ ：

# Results and discussion

The $\scriptstyle \mathbf { T i O } _ { 2 } - \mathbf { C N T - G O }$ intermediates which were synthesized by controlling the hydrolysis of TTIP are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).As shown in Fig.2a, the intermediate composite possesses sheet-like morphology，similar as graphene.CNTs can also be seen on graphene layers owing to the $\pi { - } \pi$ stacking interaction between CNTs and graphene1 and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ grown between them,which is more obvious in the highmagnification SEM image (Fig.2b). The corresponding EDX maps show homogeneous distribution of Ti,O and C in the sample,proving that the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ was distributed uniformly on the carbon materials.For comparison,the structure of CNTgraphene composite without adding TTIP was also investigated. As shown in Fig. S1,† CNTs are randomly and uniformly distributed on the surface of GO sheets.Two components stick with each other strongly due to the $\pi { - } \pi$ interaction between them.The XRD pattern (blue curve in Fig.3) shows the amorphous nature of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ species in the intermediate product. The structure of the intermediates is further investigated by trans mission electron microscope (TEM).Fig.2c presents the lowmagnification TEM image of the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -CNT-GO intermediates. The sheet-like structure can be seen,which is consistent with the SEM image.Comparing to GO,the transparency of the intermediates under electron beam is obviously lower,indicating that the thickness increases significantly. Meanwhile, some fibrous materials can be observed in the intermediates, which can be recognized as the CNTs.Zooming-in further,as shown in Fig.2d,a layer of amorphous materials distribute uniformly in the sample,which is amorphous $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ . The tubular structure of CNTs is clearly visible under the high-magnification TEM,however,the surface is obviously rougher than pure CNTs, which is due to the formation of amorphous $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ on the surface of CNTs.Therefore,it can be deduced that GO and the treated CNTs,both of which have plenty of oxygen-containing functional groups，have strong interaction with the hydrolysis products of TTIP that are rich in hydroxyl,leading to the uniform attachment of amorphous $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ on the surface of GO and CNTs，to form the intermediates with sheet-like morphology.

Fig.3 XRD patterns of the $T i O _ { 2 } - C N T - G O$ intermediates, $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ (B) and $i$ -TBCG.

Afterthe hydrothermal procedure and the calcination treatment, the amorphous $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ turns into $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ which is crystalline and the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -CNT-GO intermediates are transformed to the $i \cdot$ TBCG.Fig.3 shows the XRD patterns of the obtained samples.The red curve refers to $i \cdot$ TBCG.The lattice parameters calculated from the XRD pattern $( a = 1 2 . 1 7 9 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ $b = 3 . 7 4 1 \mathrm { \textrm { \AA } }$ $c = 6 . 5 2 5 \mathring \mathrm { A }$ ,and $\theta = 1 0 7 . 0 5 ^ { \circ }$ ) match well with $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ (JCPDS 74- 1940),exhibitinga typical $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ (bronze) structure.The black curve refers to the pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ (B) synthesized using the similar procedure as $i \cdot$ TBCG,but without adding GO and CNT,which is almost identical to the pattern for $i \cdot$ TBCG.

The SEM images of the $i$ -TBCG aredisplayed in Fig.4.As shown inFig.4a,a large number of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorodswitha few micrometers in length are loaded on graphene sheets.Fig.4b displays the SEMimage of $i$ TBCG with a higher magnification. Some parts of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods are intimately attached to graphene sheets,suggesting strong interaction between two components.It is difficult to distinguish CNTs from $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods in the SEM images due to similar size and morphology between two components.To further examine the structure of this composite,the samples were investigated by TEM.Fig.4c presents the typical TEM image of the $i \cdot$ TBCG. Graphene sheets show a thin film-like structure in this image, which is almost transparent under TEM. $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods with several micrometers in length and 50-1oo nanometers in width layrandomly on the surface of graphene sheets.CNTs can also be observed on graphene sheets,which interwine with $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanorods.In this structure,graphene sheets act as conductive substrates to support $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ ,whereas CNTs further enhance the conductivity by intimate contact with $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanorods.Fig.4d shows the high-magnification TEM image of one $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorod.Some rectangular pores can be observed from the surface of the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods,which is similar to the sample reported previously.1’ The SAED pattern indicates the single crystal nature of the nanorod,and can be indexed as the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ structure,in good accordance with the XRD results,and the crystal parameters calculated from the SAED pattern also match well with the XRD data.

Asshown in Fig.5a,the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ and $i \cdot$ TBCG isalso investigated by nitrogen sorption,which is calculated to be 32.2 and $6 5 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } ~ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ , respectively. The larger BET specific surface area for $i \cdot$ TBCG is probably attributed to the presence of graphene sheets and CNTs.The $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ sample has a broad pore size distribution centered at ${ \sim } 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ,which can be ascribed to the interparticle space of randomly stacked $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods. Fig. 5b presents the TG measurement of pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ and $i \cdot$ TBCG.It can be seen that the carbon materials decomposes thoroughly at ${ 7 0 0 } ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } .$ .The weight retention of $i$ TBCG and pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ is measured to be $8 6 . 3 \%$ and $9 7 . 3 \%$ ,respectively,so the weight percentage of carbon materials (including graphene and CNTs) is estimated to be $1 1 . 2 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ .To furtherdifferentiate the weight content of graphene and CNTs,TG measurement of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } ) /$ graphene composite without CNTs was carried and the result is shown in Fig. S3. $\dagger$ The weight loss for $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \mathrm { ( B ) } /$ graphene is $4 . 3 \%$ . It then can been calculated that the weight percent of graphene and CNT in $i \cdot$ TBCG are 1.6 and $9 . 6 \%$ ,respectively.

Fig.6a exhibits the first galvanostatic discharge/charge curves of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ and $i \cdot$ TBCG at $_ { 0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ C ~ } }$ ，The coulombic effi ciency of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ and $i \cdot$ TBCGare $5 3 . 2 \%$ and $5 0 . 5 \%$ ,respectively.

The irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle mainly arises from reactions between the surface of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ and the electro lyte.19 Thehigherirreversiblecapacityloss of $i$ -TBCGisprobably due to the irreversible reactions between ${ \bf L i } ^ { + }$ and graphene sheet.2o The capacity of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ in the first galvanostatic discharge curve is $4 9 3 . 7 \mathrm { \ m A } \mathrm { \ h \ g } ^ { - 1 }$ ，which is higher than the theoretical capacity of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ .Theextra capacity is probably caused by the side reaction of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ and the electrolyte.The capacity of $i \cdot$ TBCG is even higher than that of pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ which can be attributed to the synergetic effect of graphene and CNTs.We can see from Fig.6b that the capacity of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ and $i \cdot$ TBCG is272 and $3 8 8 \mathrm { \ m A h \ g ^ { - 1 } }$ respectively in the second cycle at the rate of $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ .With the relatively low content of carbon materials the capacity of $i \cdot$ TBCG increases by $4 2 \%$ comparing with that of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ .It is the conductive network fabricated by graphene sheets and CNTs that releases the possible capacity of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$

Fig.6b presents the rate capability of two anode materials tested from 0.1 to $1 0 \mathrm { C } .$ The significant irreversible capacity loss upon first discharge for both samples can also be found in Fig. 6b. It can be seen that $i \cdot$ TBCG shows apparent advantage over pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ in the term of capacity throughout the whole test.Ata high rate of $1 0 \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ ,the discharge capacities of $i \cdot$ TBCG and pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ reach 75.9 and $5 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m A }$ h $\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively. $i \mathrm { \cdot }$ （20 TBCG also shows better rate performance comparing with $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } ) .$ -graphene composite anode materials reported previously.16,21 It may owe to the uniform dispersion of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ nanorods in $i \cdot$ TBCG and a continuous conductive network formed byboth graphene sheetsand CNTs.The electrochemical performance of graphene and CNTs were also tested as shown in Fig. S4 and ${ \bf 5 5 . \dagger }$ Though both graphene and CNT have electrochemical activity within the voltage range of $0 . 0 1 { - } 3 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ ，their capacity contribution in $i \cdot$ -TBCG should be limited due to their low weight content (totally $1 1 . 2 \mathrm { \ w t { \% } } \dot { }$ )in the ternary composite. The main function of graphene and CNTs in $i \cdot$ TBCGisto fabricate a conductive network to enhance the electrochemical performance of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ .After the high rate test, the cells were remeasuredatarelativelylowrate of $_ { 1 \mathrm { ~ C ~ } }$ again.It is surprising to note that the capacities of the two anode materials both exceed the ones measured during the initial $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 C }$ cycles.This phenomenon has been observed in $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ anode materials,10a which was ascribed to the activation process of the electrode materials during cycling.To further verify the effect of the conductive network composed by both graphene and CNTs in $i \cdot$ TBCG,the electrochemical performance of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \mathrm { \left( B \right) } /$ graphene composite and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \mathrm { \left( B \right) } / \mathrm { C N T s }$ composite were tested.As shown in Fig. S6 and ${ \bf 5 7 , \dagger }$ theirrate performance is apparently worse than that of $i \cdot$ TBCG，suggesting the synergetic effect of graphene and CNTsin improving the electrochemical performance of $i$ TBCG.

Fig.6c shows the typical curves for galvanostatic discharge/ charge of $i$ -TBCG at different rates.As the rate increases,the gradient of the discharge curve increases,and the voltage gap between the charge and discharge curves also increases,indicating raised polarization at high rates.Fig.6d exhibits the cycling tests of $i \cdot$ TBCGat $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 C }$ for 200 cycles (except the first two cycles).The specific discharge capacity of $i$ TBCGis $1 9 0 \mathrm { \ m A } \mathrm { ~ h ~ g ^ { - 1 } ~ }$ at the $2 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ cycle,which still retains $9 6 \%$ of its initial discharge capacity,showing excellent cycling stability.

In order to investigate the rate performance of the two anode materials further,Nyquist plots are measured after the rate tests.Circle arc in the high frequency region and the sloping straight line in the low frequency region is basically related to the transportation of electron and lithium ion in the active material，respectively.2² As exhibited in Fig.7, $i \cdot$ TBCG has smaller circle arc in the high frequency region and larger gradient of the sloping straight line in the low frequency region comparing with those of pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ ，implying better rate performance than that of pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ ,which agreeswith the rate capability tests.

# Conclusions

The $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ -CNT-graphene ternary composite was synthesized through in situ growth procedure,in which $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ was uniformly distributed on the conductive network composed by both graphene and CNTs. The $i \cdot$ TBCG composites show better rate performance and better cycle stability than pure $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { B } )$ The conductive network constructed by both graphene sheets and CNTs contributes to the excellent electrochemical perfor mance of this anode material.Itis believed that the conductive network fabricated by the carbon materials can also been applied to other anode materials with low conductivity,thus to produce series of high-performance electrode materials.
