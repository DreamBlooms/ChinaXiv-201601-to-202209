Abstract: The farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China is an extremely fragile ecological zone where wind erosion of cropland and rangeland is easy to occur. In this study,using a portable wind tunnel as a wind simulator,we conducted field simulated wind erosion experiments combined with laboratory analysis to investigate wind erosion of soils in trampled rangeland, non-tilled cropland and tilled cropland in Yanchi County, China. The results showed that compared with rangeland, the cropland had a higher soil water holding capacity and lower soil bulk density. The wind erosion rate of trampled rangeland was much higher than those of non-tilled cropland and tiled cropland.For cropland,the wind erosion rate of the soil after tiling was surprisingly lessthan that of the soil before tiling. With increasing of wind speed,the volume mean diameter of the eroded sediment colected by the trough in the wind tunnel generally increased while the clay and silt content decreased for all soils.The temporal variation in wind erosion of the trampled rangeland indicated that particle entrainment and dust emission decreased exponentially with erosion time through the successive wind erosion events due to the exhaustion of erodible particles.

# 1 Introduction

Wind erosion is widespread over the land surface of Earth. It reduces agricultural sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions (Yang and Lu,2O16). Wind erosion has significant offsite effects and can greatly affect local and regional air quality by entraining fine particles $( < 1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ in the case of an aerosol) and nutrients from the soil surface into the air (Zobeck and Van Pelt,2011).In China,the total area of sandy desertification, caused primarily by wind erosion of soil,was $1 . 8 2 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } ~ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ (Wang et al., 2Oo8). This area accounted for ${ > } 6 9 . 9 3 \%$ of the total desertification area in 2O14，which also included waterpower desertification， saline desertification，and freeze-thaw desertification (State Forestry Administration,PR China,2015).

The farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China is the transitional zone between humid areas of traditional intensive cultivation and arid and semi-arid areas of rangeland (Zhou and Zhang,1992). It is an extremely fragile ecological zone.Because of insufficient precipitation, the frequent occurrence of drought and strong winds in spring，as well as over-grazing and extensive reclamation of rangeland, the related aeolian processes are severe in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China (Zhu and Chen,1994) and have been identified as the primary cause of soil degradation in this area (Yan et al.，2O1O). Some studies suggested that the cropland in the farming-pastoral ecotone is one of the major sources of dust (Dong et al., 2Ooo; Liu et al., 2007), since tillge can break clods,weaken soil mechanical stability，and increase soil erodibility (Chepil,1953; Chepil and Woodruff,1954;Fryrear,1981； Zobeck and Popham,1990).Wind erosion of soil removes the fine soil particles (consisting mainly of clay, silt and organic matter), which are some of the most important soil constituents. Since both soil particle size and the proportions of sand, silt and clay are of primary importance to soil structure and stability (Chepil and Woodruf,1954; Zhao et al.,2Oo5), the preferential removal of fine particles is detrimental to the soil structure (Li et al.,2O15). These fine particles also greatly influence the soil water holding capacity, so their removal could reduce soil moisture storage.Nutrient elements also tend to be attached to the fine particles,thus the loss of fine particles could reduce soil fertility (Zobeck and Popham,199O; Sharratt et al.,2015). Overall, the loss of topsoil with fine particles due to wind erosion has a measurable effect on crop yields (Tang et al., 2016).

Wind erosion may be triggered and promoted by soil disturbance due to various activities such as cultivation, grazing and traffic (Liu et al., 2003;Li et al.,2004;Wang et al., 2011). The disturbance of soil crusts,for example by livestock trampling or tillage,can increase the amount of the eroded sediment (Baddock et al.,2O11),and may also influence the entrainment threshold by changing the grain size distribution of soil on the surface (Belnap et al., 2OO7). Wind erosion can reduce soil productivity in a variety of ways. Specifically, fine soil particles containing nutrients are lost, and the remaining particles give the soil a coarser texture. The abrasion of shoots by soil particles during saltation can result in heavy damage to crops，which can be particularly serious in spring when crops sprout. The cultivation of cropland can greatly increase soil loss through wind erosion when compared to uncultivated cropland (Liu et al.,2OO7; Sharratt et al.,2O1O; Singh et al., 2Ol2). Cultivation increases the erodible fraction and reduces the dry aggregate stability of medium-textured soils since these soils lack cementing agents (Colazo and Buschiazzo,2O1O).For cropland, wind erosion of soil varies considerably after the tillage because a physical crust is formed by dew, which protects the soils from wind erosion (Segovia et al., 2017).For rangeland,animals trampling the soil also increases the mass of erodible fine particles (Baddock et al., 2011). An important approach reducing wind erosion of cropland is leaving crop residue in the field(Van Pelt et al.，2Ol3). Conversion to conservation tillage with stubble management from conventional tillage significantly increases soil organic carbon in a relatively short period (Gao et al.,2O16). The sediment transport amount during the growing season of crops in cultivated cropland of arid and semi-arid regions was low because of crop residue (Zhang et al., 2013).

Although wind erosion of cropland and rangeland is well understood,the erodibility of both land types in the same locality is stillto be investigated.The goal of this study is to evaluate the wind erosion of cropland and rangeland in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China. To quantify soil stability and wind erosion rate, we integrated soil analyses with field simulated wind erosion experiments using a portable wind tunnel. The short-term dynamics of wind erosion were also analyzed.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1 Study area

Field experiments were conducted at the Desert Steppe Ecosystem Experimental Research Base of Ningxia University $( 3 7 ^ { \circ } 4 9 ^ { \prime } 3 0 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ ， $1 0 7 ^ { \circ } 2 9 ^ { \prime } 2 2 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E }$ ： $1 4 1 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ a.s.l.)，which is located in Yanchi

County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China (Fig.la). The study area is characterized by a continental monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m m }$ ，mean annual evaporation of $2 1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and annual mean temperature of $7 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 、Average annual wind speed is $2 . 8 \mathrm { \ m / s }$ ， and the prevailing wind direction is from the northwest to the southeast. The mean occurrence of gale-force events (wind speed $\mathrm { > } 1 7 ~ \mathrm { m / s } \mathrm { \dot { \Omega } }$ is $3 0 \mathrm { d / a }$ and the occurrence of sand storms and blowing dust events is $2 0 \mathrm { d / a }$ (Zhang et al., 2O13). The zonal soil is aeolian sandy soil derived from aeolian sediment. The vegetation types are shrub vegetation, meadow, steppe,and sandy or desert vegetation. Shrubs are dominated by Salix psammophila and Caragana microphylla, which have a high coverage and are widely distributed. The desert steppe is dominated by Caragana tibetica, Oxytropis aciphylla, Nitraria sibirica and Kalidium foliatum (Liu et al.,2015). The arid rangeland is dominated by Stipa grandis， Stipa bungeana, Agropyron cristatum and Thymus serpyllum var. mongolicus. In the study area, there are discontinuous areas of irrgated cropland around peasant houses and extensive rangeland lies beyond the cropland (Fig.1b). Since 2003, the cropland has been cultivated with maize as the main crop in most years. Since 2011,the grazing intensity in the rangeland has been at the present level of about 2.5 sheep $/ \mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ ：

# 2.2Experimental design and in-situ experimental facility

In this study,a portable wind tunnel was used to investigate wind erosion of cropland and rangeland. The cropland treatments included non-tilld cropland (NTC) and tiled cropland (TC). The NTC was not ploughed after being harvested the previous year. The TC was loosened with a spade immediately before the field simulated wind erosion experiments were carried out. For rangeland,a severe trampled rangeland (TR） site on a path near the sheepfold was selected because it was normally trampled by sheep every day without any further artificial operation.

Field simulated wind erosion experiments were conducted in early April 2O17 using a portable wind tunnel (Fig.2). The portable wind tunnel enables quasi-natural wind erosion simulation under controlled conditions (Leys and Raupach,1991） and provides dynamic and quantitative information on particle transport by wind erosion. The wind tunnel had a rectangular cross-section ( $\mathrm { 0 . 4 ~ m }$ width $\times 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ height), with an open-floored working section up to $5 . 0 \mathrm { m }$ long. The air flow in the tunnel was produced by a mixed flow blower controlled by a frequency changer. The mixed flow blower was_connected to the leading end of the flow-straightening section by a flexible connection made of canvas. The wind speed could be varied from O to $2 2 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ At the end of the wind tunnel,a sediment collection trough ( $3 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ wide, $5 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ long and $1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ deep) constructed with polyvinyl chloride sheeting was used to make the eroded sediment deposited. Then,the eroded sediment was collected by a vacuum cleaner to obtain the weight and to test the dry particle size distribution (Fister and Ries,2O9).A DustTrak Aerosol Monitor 8533 (TSI Ltd., USA）was used to monitor the dust concentration $( \mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 } , \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } )$ during the experiments.The inlet tube for the monitor was set at the end of the wind tunnel at a height of $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ . Data were collected at a frequency of $1 \ \mathrm { H z }$ .The wind speeds set for the experiments were 8,12 and $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ Wind speed was measured at a height of $2 5 \ \mathrm { c m }$ aboveground by a rotating vane anemometer. For TC and NTC, the blowing time was set as $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at each wind speed. For TR, the blowing time was also set as $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ totally at each wind speed,but it was further divided into five 2-min intervals. After ending of every 10-min blowing event for TC and NTC and 2-min blowing event for TR,the eroded sediment in the trough was collected to weigh and test dry particle size distribution. There were five sets of data for TR and they were used to characterize the dynamics of wind erosion.

# 2.3 Soil sampling and analysis

Soil samples with three replicates were taken from both cropland and rangeland before the field simulated wind erosion experiments were carried out. A soil auger and sampling ring were used to collect samples to the depth of $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ for analyses of bulk density and primary soil particle size. Soil samples used to determine the water content were taken from the surface soil layer $( 0 { - } 3 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ and subsurface soil layer $( 3 { - } 1 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } )$ because there is an appreciable difference of water content between these two layers. The undisturbed soil samples for the dry aggregate analysis were taken and parceled using a rectangular aluminum specimen box (17 cm long, $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ wide and $5 \ \mathrm { c m }$ （204号 deep).The box cut into the soil like a sampling ring. Then the box was dug out from the surrounding soil using a spade,and the excess soil was removed from the box. The soil in the box was considered as the undisturbed sample. All soil samples were taken to the laboratory for physical analyses.

Soil water content and bulk density were obtained by the gravimetric method (ISSAS,1978). Primary particle size distribution of soil was determined from dispersed soil samples using a Mastersizer 2Ooo laser diffraction analyzer (Malvern Instruments Ltd.,，Malvern，UK).The preparation of primary particle size analysis was as follows.A subsample containing about $0 . 5 \mathrm { - } 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { g }$ of soil was pre-treated with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $3 0 \% \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ to remove organic matter. Then, it was boiled with $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $10 \%$ HCl to remove carbonates.Finally, it was washed in distilled $_ \mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ .The sample was then dispersed with $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ （204 $( \mathrm { N a P O } _ { 3 } ) _ { 6 }$ before taking measurements.Dry particle size distribution of the eroded sediment collected in the field simulated wind erosion experiments was determined using an S35OO particle size analyzer (Microtrac Ltd., New York, USA） with a dry powder dispersion system. The eroded sediment samples for dry particle size distribution analysis were sieved with a $1 \mathrm { - m m }$ mesh sieve to remove plant residue and sheep excrement. Dry aggregate size distribution of undisturbed soil samples was measured using the dry sieving method (ISSAS,1978). The undisturbed soil samples were air-dried firstlyand water content of the air-dried soil samples was measured. Then,the air-dried soil samples were sieved through a set of six sieves (diameters of $5 . 0 0 , \ 2 . 0 0 , \ 1 . 0 0 , \ 0 . 8 0 , \ 0 . 5 0 , \ 0 . 2 5 \ \mathrm { m m } )$ ，which were shaken by a standard test sieve shaker with moderate amplitude for O.5 and $5 . 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ,respectively. After sieving, each size fraction was weighed separately. The results of the $0 . 5 \mathrm { - m i n }$ sieving were used to calculate the wind erodible fraction.As suggested by Campbel et al. (1993), the particle diameter of the wind erodible fraction was $< 0 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ .In this study,particle with diameter being lower than $0 . 8 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ was considered as wind erodible fraction. The dry aggregate stability was given by the change in erodible fraction from O.5-min sieving to 5.O-min sieving.

# 2.4Data analysis

In this study, the volume mean diameter (MDV) was calculated to quantify the dry particle size distribution of the eroded sediment:

$$
\mathrm { M D V } = \sum x _ { i } \nu _ { i } ,
$$

where $x _ { i }$ is the mean diameter of the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ particle size range (mm), and $\nu _ { i }$ is the volume percentage of the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ particle size range $( \% )$ ，which represented as a percentage of the total sample. In this study, the value of MDV was directly obtained from test result.

Wind erosion rate $( Q )$ was calculated from weight of the eroded sediment using Equation 2:

$$
Q = \frac { W } { A \times T } ,
$$

where $W$ is the weight of the eroded sediment $( \mathbf { g } ) ; A$ is the area of soil surface which suffered wind erosion $( \mathbf { m } ^ { 2 } )$ ; and $T$ is the duration of simulated blowing event (min).

The erodible fraction (EF) of the soil was calculated using Equation 3:

$$
{ \mathrm { E F } } { = } \frac { W _ { < 0 . 8 } } { T W } { \times } 1 0 0 \
$$

where EF is the erodible fraction of the soil $( \% )$ ：， $W _ { < 0 . 8 }$ is the weight of aggregates with diameter $< 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { m m } \ \mathrm { ( g ) }$ ; and TW is the initial weight of total samples (g).

The dry aggregate stability (DAS) was given by the change in erodible fraction from $0 . 5 \mathrm { - m i n }$ sieving to 5.O-min sieving,as shown in Equation 4:

$$
\mathrm { D A S } { = } \frac { W _ { > 0 . 8 ( 0 . 5 ) } - W _ { > 0 . 8 ( 5 . 0 ) } } { W _ { > 0 . 8 ( 0 . 5 ) } } \times 1 0 0 \
$$

where $W _ { > 0 . 8 ( 0 . 5 ) }$ is the weight of aggregates that retained above the $0 . 8 – \mathrm { m m }$ sieve after a $0 . 5 \mathrm { - m i n }$ sieving $( \mathbf { g } )$ ，and $W _ { > 0 . 8 ( 5 . 0 ) }$ is the weight of aggregates that retained above the $0 . 8 \mathrm { - m m }$ sieve after a $5 . 0 \mathrm { - m i n }$ sieving $( \mathbf { g } )$ ：

To describe the temporal variation in successive wind erosion events, Shao (2Oo8) introduced the parameter $\sigma$ to indicate the exhaustion of entrainable particles.The values of $\sigma$ are indices of the fractional decrease of wind erosion rate $( Q )$ and dust $\left( \mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 } \right)$ emission rate $( E )$ as a function of the successive wind erosion events, expressing as Equations 5 and 6:

$$
\sigma _ { Q } = \frac { Q _ { i } } { Q _ { 1 } } = \frac { W _ { i } } { W _ { 1 } } ,
$$

$$
\sigma _ { E } = \frac { E _ { i } } { E _ { 1 } } ,
$$

where $W _ { i }$ is the weight of the eroded sediment during the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ wind erosion event (g); $E _ { i }$ is the dust $\left( \mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 } \right)$ emission rate of the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ wind erosion event $\mathrm { ( m g / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } s ) ) }$ ： $W _ { 1 }$ is the weight of the eroded sediment during the first wind erosion event $( \mathbf { g } )$ ; and $E _ { 1 }$ is the dust $\left( \mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 } \right)$ emission rate of the first wind erosion event $\mathrm { ( m g / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } s ) ) }$ ：

In this study,the difference of soil properties between treatments were tested by the one-way ANOVA. Difference was considered significant at the $P { < } 0 . 0 5$ level.Mean values were compared using LSD (Least-Significant Difference).

# 3Results and discussion

# 3.1 Wind erosion rate

The field simulated wind erosion experiments showed different soil loss levels and trends as wind speed varied (Fig.3). Specifically,at the wind speed of $8 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ , the wind erosion rate of NTC was far lower than those of TR and TC,which were almost at the same level. When the wind speed was increased from 8 to $1 2 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ ,the wind erosion rates of NTC,TC and TR were multiplied by 8.7,1.7 and 65 times,respectively，and the NTC and TC almost had the similar erosion rate. When the wind speed was increased from 12 to $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ ,the wind erosion rates of NTC,TC and TR were multiplied by 4.6,1.5 and 2.5 times,respectively，and the erosion rate of TR was significantly higher than those of TC and NTC.

Fig.3Wind erosion rates of NTC (non-tilled cropland),TC (tilled cropland) and TR (trampled rangeland) at different wind speeds

The higher wind erosion rate of TR than NTC and TC was confirmed by the differences in soil physical properties (Table 1） and primary particle size composition (Table 2） between cropland and rangeland. Soils in both cropland and rangeland were classified as sandy clay loam (USDA soil texture classification).However, there were significant differences in soil particle size composition between cropland and rangeland. The particle size distribution of soil may change over time due to the winnowing process. The coarser soil texture in rangeland exhibited by high sand content may be related to the long-term influence of trampling,which resulted in the uplift of fine particles from the soil surface into the atmosphere by wind erosion (Churchman et al., 2010).Thus,the wind erosion rate of TR was higher than that of NTC.

In this study, the lowest wind erosion rate of TC at the high wind speed (Fig.3) is inconsistent with some previous results. For example，Liu et al. (2OO3，2007） found that tillage can significantly increase wind erosion. Our finding of an unexpected reduction of wind erosion after tillage may be caused by the differences of soil water content. In this study,the water contents of subsurface soil in both cropland and rangeland were much higher than those of surface soil because of a precipitation event occurred nine days before the field simulated wind erosion experiments. The evaporation and infiltration of surface soil water resulted in the water content of subsurface soil being higher than that of surface soil. Water content of surface soil before tillage was close to the value of air-dried soil sample. However, the water content of surface soil will become higher after tillage. Soil water content is a critical factor in the reduction of wind erodibility (Webb and McGowan,2009). The experiments of Wiggs et al. (2004) showed that aeolian sand transport is sensitive to small changes in soil moisture content and that the entrainment of particles is unlikely above a moisture threshold of $4 \% - 6 \%$ .These findings could explain why the TC had low wind erosion rate at high wind speeds (12 and $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m / s } ,$ ）

The determination of dry aggregate size distribution is another widely-used method for studying the wind erosion (Kemper and Rosenau,1986). Campbell et al.(1993) determined that the particle diameter of the wind erodible fraction is $< 0 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ .The main properties of dry soil aggregates that indicate their susceptibility to wind erosion are stability. As shown in Table 1, the wind erodible fraction of rangeland was higher than that of cropland,while the soil aggregate stability of rangeland was lower than that of cropland. Generally speaking,the constituents of soil aggregates are the outcome of many aggregate-forming and aggregate-degrading processes (Skidmore and Layton，1992). The higher non-erodible fraction and aggregate stability for cropland than for rangeland are related to the higher fine particle proportion (clay and silt content) in cropland, which is considered to be one of the significant cementing factors in soil aggregation (Tisdall and Oades,1982; Amézketa,1999). Previous studies have shown that long-term grazing could reduce soil aggregation (Hiernaux et al., 1999; Steffens et al.,2008; Zhou et al.,2010). Moreover, mechanical tillage operations and stubble grazing intensity also have immediate and direct influences on soil aggregation (Tanner et al., 2O16),leading to the increase of the eroded sediment in the surface soil (Fister and Ries,2OO9; Baddock et al., 2O11). Tanner et al. (2016) found that wind erosion rates were higher in grazing plots than in tilage plots at high wind speeds. Similar results were found in our study,that is,the TR was more susceptible to higher wind erosivity (wind speeds of 12 and $1 6 \ \mathrm { m / s }$ ） than the TC. There are two possible reasons.First, trampling is a day-by-day activity, which may generate more impacts on soil than tiling (an occasional activity). Second, tilage may increase the water content of surface soil， thereby reducing wind erosion.

# 3.2 Particle size characteristics of the eroded sediment

The values of volume mean diameter of the collected eroded sediment are shown in Figure 4.As expected, the volume mean diameter of the eroded sediment generally increased with increasing of wind speed in all soil surface conditions. However, the trends of the values differed between treatments. Generally speaking,the variations of volume mean diameter of the eroded sediment along with the increasing of wind speed were similar with those of wind erosion rate. For TR, the greatest volume mean diameter of the eroded sediment was observed at the highest wind erosion rate (corresponding to wind speed of $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ ); and for NTC,the lowest volume mean diameter of the eroded sediment was observed at the lowest wind erosion rate (corresponding to wind speed of $8 \ \mathrm { m / s } ,$ . The variations in the volume mean diameter could reflect how air flow entrains different size particles at different wind speeds.Apart from the diferent modes of transport (sand in saltation and dust in suspension), selective aeolian entrainment with respect to grain size is an important aspect of particle transportation (Flores-Aqueveque et al., 2010).

Figure 5 shows the clay and silt content of the eroded sediment. The clay and silt content showed an opposite trend with the volume mean diameter of the eroded sediment and wind erosion rate.As shown in Figure 5,the higher the wind speed,the lower the clay and silt content in the eroded sediment. In other words,as wind speed increases,the proportion of coarse particles was generally higher than the proportion of fine particles in the eroded sediment. This selective effect of wind erosion occurs during the processes of entrainment, transportation,and deposition. At the lower wind speeds,the selective effect occurs during entrainment as only smaller fine particles become windborne.At the higher wind speeds,allthe soil particles can be entrained.The same processes should be manifest in the transport and deposition phases of wind erosion.

# 3.3Temporal variation of wind erosion

To investigate the temporal variation of wind erosion, indicated by the amount of the eroded sediment, we analyzed the mean and maximum emission rates of $\mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ for TR,which had a much higher wind erosion rate. The results are shown in Figure 6.The soil loss peaked during the first blowing session and subsequently decreased rapidly at each wind speed.Liu et al.(2003) suggested that soil loss decreases exponentially with respect to the successve blowing and the decrease depends mainly on the erodible particles and structural condition of the soil.In this study, we found the effect of wind speed on erosion from the soil surface in TR: the greater the wind speed,the faster the wind erosion rate decreased with erosion time.This indicates that the less blowing time is required for erodible particles to be deflated at the high wind speeds. Soil loss decreased unevenly during wind erosion events. The maximum and mean emission rates of $\mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ in the five successve wind erosion events are shown in Figures 6b and c, respectively.The mean emission rate of $\mathbf { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ ranged from O.O7 (the fifth 2-min blowing event with wind speed of $8 ~ \mathrm { m / s } )$ 0 to $9 1 . 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { s } )$ (the first 2-min blowing event with wind speed of $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m / s } ,$ ). Our findings are consistent with the results of Zhang et al. (2O16),who studied the mechanisms of dust emission and concluded that dust was entrained in the first $2 { \cdot } 3 \mathrm { m i n }$ of the simulated wind erosion experiments if the dust supply was unlimited. The surface renewal process is an important mechanism that affects dust emission.

Fig.6Temporal variations of the amount of the eroded sediment (a),the mean $\mathbf { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ emission rate (b) and the maximum $\mathbf { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ emission rate of (c) in the five successive $2 \mathrm { - m i n }$ blowing events in TR.Note that values of horizontal axis represent the order of the five successive 2-min blowing events.

The $\sigma$ values in our study are presented in Table 3.The results show that at the wind speeds of 8 and $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ ，the $\sigma$ values of the wind erosion rate and $\mathbf { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ emission rate decreased quickly until the end of the second 2-min blowing event.At the wind speed of $1 2 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ ，there was also a rapid decrease in the $\sigma$ values during the third 2-min blowing event. These results indicate that the erodible soil particles are mainly exhausted in the first and second 2-min blowing events.The complete exhaustion of erodible particles will occur sooner or later, depending on both the wind erosion rate and the supply of fine particles. Grini et al. (2OO2) explained that the emission of fine particulate mater was sustained from the fine textured soils in the successive wind erosion events due to the high content of $\mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ in soil aggregates.The fine particles are available for entrainment over longer time periods.However,in the coarse textured soils,the $\mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ particles with low content in non-aggregated soil are loose or lightly bonded to sand grains,and thus they are rapidly depleted by the saltation process (Panebianco et al., 2016).

# 4 Conclusions

We investigated wind erosion under different soil disturbances in Yanchi County, using a portable wind tunnel. Compared with rangeland soil, the cropland soil had lower bulk density, higher water holding capacity, and higher clay and silt content. As the wind speed increased from 8 to $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ the wind erosion rate increased sharply for TR,remained almost steady for TC,and increased moderately for NTC.An unexpected reduction in wind erosion was found in TC at the wind speeds of 12 and $1 6 \ \mathrm { m / s }$ ，with the wind erosion rate being lowest in TC among the three treatments.With increasing of wind speed, the volume mean diameter of the eroded sediment generally increased while the clay and silt content decreased in all soil surface conditions.For a series of successive wind erosion events in TR,the wind erosion rate and $\mathrm { P M } _ { 1 0 }$ emission rate decreased with erosion time due to the exhaustion of erodible particles.
