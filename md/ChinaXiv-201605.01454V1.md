The (3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase HadAB,involved in the biosynthetic pathway for mycolic acid (MA)of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,catalyzes the third step in the fattyacid (FA)elongation cycle,which is an ideal and actual target for anti-tubercularagent.Though HadAB is predicted to be a member of the hotdog superfamily,it shares no sequence identity with typical hotdog fold isoenzyme FabZ.To characterize the significance of HadAB from the perspective of structural biology,large amount of pure HadAB complex is required for biochemical characterization and crystalization. Here,we used aunique expression and purification method.HadA and HadB were cloned separately and co-expressed in Escherichia coli. After GST affnity chromatography,two steps of anion exchange chromatography and gelfiltration,the purity of the protein as estimated by SDS-PAGE was ${ > } 9 5 \%$ .Using hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, crystals were obtained and diffracted X-rays to $1 . 7 5 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ resolution. The crystal belongs to space group $P 4 _ { 1 } 2 _ { 1 } 2$ ,with unit-cell parameters $a = b = 8 2 . 0 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ $c = 1 3 9 . 8 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ $\mathcal { \alpha } = \beta = \gamma = 9 0 . 0 ^ { \circ }$

# 1. Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB),caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb), is the second most common cause of death due to a single infectious pathogen with an enormous global medical burden [1,2]. The complicated cell envelope of Mtb contains many kinds of lipids which play vital roles in the physiology and pathogenicity of this bacterium[3,4]. Mycolic acids(MAs)，2-alkyl，3-hydroxy long-chain $\left( \mathsf { C } _ { 6 0 } \mathrm { - } \mathsf { C } _ { 9 0 } \right)$ fatty acids,constitute the major and specific lipid component of the envelope.They either link covalently to the cell wall peptidoglycan via the underlying arabinogalactan to formMycolicacid-Arabinogalactan-Peptidoglycancomplex (MAPc) or exist in the mycomembrane as trehalose mono- and dimycolates [5].This providesa thick layer of lipid in the cell wall and protects the Mtb from dry environment,poisonous chemicals and host's immune system [6,7].

The biosynthetic pathway of this MAs involves two types of fatty acid-synthesizing systems (FASs): the multifunctional FAS-I and the dissociated FAS-II [8] (Fig.1). The latter is composed of a series of discrete soluble enzymes which act successively and repetitively to elongate the FA chains produced by FAS-I [7]. There are four kinds of enzymes catalyze each cycle of elongation in Mtb:the $\beta$ -ketoacyl-ACP synthetases (KasA and KasB,Rv2245 and Rv2246,respectively. Enzyme Classification No.: 2.3.1.41), the ${ \mathfrak { \beta } }$ -ketoacyl-ACP reductase(MabA,Rv1483.EC:1.1.1.10O), the $\beta$ -hydroxyacyl-ACPdehydratases(HadAB and HadBC, Rv0635-Rv0636 and Rv0636-Rv0637.EC Number is not registered),and the trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase (InhA,Rv1484.EC: 1.3.1.9).Deficiency or inactivation of anyone above will cease the biosynthesis of MA and absence of these enzymes in human make them very ideal and actual targets for drug discovery [9,10].

The(3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase HadAB,composed of two subunits HadA(RvO635）and HadB(RvO636),catalyzes the thirdstepintheFA elongationcyclebydehydrating $\beta$ -hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans-2-enoyl-ACP,which is the last piece to be identified in the mycobacterial FAS-II[11].HadAB would take part,like KasA,in the early FA elongation cycles,leading to the formation ofthe intermediate-size $( C _ { 3 2 } \mathrm { - } C _ { 4 2 } )$ meromycolic chains,while HadBC，like KasB，would elongate further the intermediate-size meromycolic chains to full-size molecules $( C _ { 5 2 } \mathrm { - } C _ { 6 4 } )$ during the late elongation cycles[11,12]. It has been verified that NAS-21,NAS-91,some kinds of flavonoidsand ananti-TB prodrug Thiacetazone（TAC）can inhibit the activity of HadB (RvO636)as well as the growth of bacteria at different levels by mutation and overexpression methods [13-16].Therefore HadAB complexis a significant drug target.

Though HadAB is predicted to be a member of hotdog superfamily,itresides only in Corynebacterineaeand presentsadifferent or distantly related catalytic sequence motif compared to the typical isoenzyme FabZ(EC:4.2.1.59)which widely represented in other bacteria[11,17,18]. Currently,all of the resolved FabZ structures have similar hexametric hotdog fold structures,displaying a classic “trimer of homodimer"organization [19-22].Because of the particular long substrate and failing to identify a specifc mycobacterial homologue by BLAST searches of E.coli FabA(EC: 4.2.1.59 and 5.3.3.14)[17],another typical member of hotdog family[23], it seems possible thatHadAB possesses new structural features to execute dehydration process.Determination of the crystal structure of HadAB would allow thorough understanding of the differences and similarities between HadAB and FabZ and lay the foundation for new anti-TB drug development.

In this work, because common or tandem expression could not get enough protein with high purity and stability for crystallization,a method for co-expression of the recombinant HadAB was developed.The gene of HadA and HadB was cloned respectively into different vectors,co-transformed into E.coli cells and the enzyme HadAB complex was expressed.Then we described the purification,crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of HadAB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Our work provided a particular method of protein complex expression and purification and laid the foundation for structure determination of HadAB and more similar enzymic complexes.

# 2.1. Molecular cloning

The Rvo635 gene encoding HadA wasamplified from M.tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA by using ExTaq polymerase(TaKaRa） as well astheforwardprimer $5 ^ { \prime } \cdot$ :TTCCATATGGTGGCGTTGA GCGCAGACAT- ${ \cdot } 3 ^ { \prime }$ andthe reverse primer $5 ^ { \prime }$ -CCGCTCGAGTCA CGCAGCGCCATCAGAAA- $3 ^ { \prime }$ .Ndel and Xhol restriction sites are underlined.Amplification were carried out bya thermal cycler (Bio-Rad） according to the following protocol: step 1, $9 5 ^ { \circ } C$ for $3 0 0 s$ ：step2, $9 4 ^ { \circ } C$ for $4 0 \ : s$ ；step3, $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $4 0 \ : s$ ；step 4, $7 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $3 2 s$ ：repeat from step 2 for 3O cycles.The PCR products were subjected to a final amplification step of $5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at $7 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ Theywere separated by horizontal electrophoresis in $1 \%$ agarose gel. The product corresponding to HadA(about 5oo bp) was extracted from the gel using the DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN).Then the purified PCR product was hydrolyzed with endonucleases NdeI and Xhol and ligated according to the manufacturer's protocol with expression vector pRSFDuet-1 (Novagen)，which was preliminarily treated with the same endonucleases.The Rvo636 gene from the same source which encodes HadB was PCR-amplified using primers pBm_F( $5 ^ { \prime }$ -CGCGGATCCATGGCGCTGCGTGAGTTCAG- $3 ^ { \prime }$ )andpXh_R 0 $5 ^ { \prime }$ -CCGCTCGAGCTACGCTAACTTCGCCGAGG- $3 ^ { \prime }$ ).BamHI and Xhol restriction sites are underlined.Amplification protocol is the same as HadA.After restriction digestion,the gene was ligated into the pGEX-6p-1 vector (GE Healthcare).The recombinant plasmids pRSFDuet-1-HadA and pGEX-6p-1-HadB were co-transformed into E.coli. BL21(DE3） for expression. Correct clone was screened by bi-anti agar plate and PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

# 2.2.Expression and purification of HadAB

Forexpression ofGST-HadAB recombinant protein,the cells were grown aerobically at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ in $2 \mathrm { L }$ Terrific Broth medium with $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ ampicillin and $5 0 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ kanamycin.When the ${ \tt O D } _ { 6 0 0 }$ reached ${ \sim } 1 . 0$ ,the culture was induced with $0 . 3 \mathrm { m M }$ isoprop yl- $\cdot \beta$ -D-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG,Sigma) and incubated at $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $1 8 \mathrm { h }$ ，Cells were harvested by centrifugation at $4 2 0 0 g$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ and resuspended in $1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ Buffer A( $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ TrisHCl, $\mathtt { p H 8 . 0 , 3 0 0 m M N a C l }$ ,and $1 0 \% ( \nu / \nu )$ glycerol). Suspension was passed through the High voltage Homogenizer(AVESTIN Company,EF-C3) for4 times on ice,and the cellswere lysed by the high pressureat around $1 2 0 \mathrm { M P a }$ [24].The lysate was centrifuged at $3 0 { , } 7 0 0 g$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ to remove unbroken cells and debris. The supernatant was loaded onto a column with $2 { \mathrm { m L } }$ Glutathione Sepharose resin(GE Healthcare）pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 3O-5O column volumes of Buffer A to removeunbound proteinsand then incubated in $1 0 \mathrm { m L }$ BufferA containing $3 0 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ Prescission Protease at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ overnight to cut off GST tag.The next day,the flow through containing the untagged HadAB was collected,and desalted with six-fold dilusion with Buffer B ( $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tris-HCl, $\mathtt { p H 8 . 0 , 5 0 } \mathtt { m M N a C l }$ and $1 0 \%$ （20 $( \nu / \nu )$ glycerol).It was further purified usinga 5 mL HiTrapTM QHP anion exchange column (GE Healthcare）with an AKTA purifier（GE Healthcare）machine at $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The column was pre-equilibrated with Buffer B and the protein sample was loaded onto the column with $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ flow rate.After thorough washing with Buffer B for 2-3 column volumes,protein bound to the column was eluted with a linear gradient $( 0 . 0 5 \substack { - 0 . 5 \mathrm { M } } )$ of NaCl concentration in 8 column volumes with $1 . 5 \mathrm { m L } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ flowrate.The linear gradient of NaCl concentration was created by mixing Buffer B and Buffer C L $\mathrm { 5 0 ~ m M }$ Tris-HCl,pH 8.0,1 M NaCl and $1 0 \% \ ( \nu / \nu )$ glycerol）by AKTA purifier machine.Fractions containing protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Concentration of the separating gel and concentrating gel was $1 6 \%$ and $4 \%$ ,respectively.Gels were stained with Coomassie R-250.Those fractions that contained pure target protein were pooled,desalted with Buffer B and then further purified byusinga $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ RESOURCETM $\mathsf { Q }$ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). After processing in the same way,the pure target protein was pooled,concentrated to a volume less than $5 0 0 ~  { \mu \mathrm { L } }$ and injected into a $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ SuperdexTm 75 10/30O GL gel-fltration column （GE Healthcare）pre-equilibrated with Buffer D ( $5 0 \mathrm { m M }$ Tris-HCl,pH 8.0, $1 5 0 \mathrm { m M N a C l }$ and $1 0 \% ( \nu / \nu )$ glycerol). The protein sample was eluted with $0 . 5 \mathrm { m L } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ flow rate and collected by fractions. After SDS-PAGE analysis,fractions containing pure and homogenous HadAB was pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon centrifugal device(Millipore). The protein concentration was calculated by measuring the sample absorbance at $2 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and adjusting with its extinction coefficient of 1.15.Purified HadAB was finally concentrated to $1 0 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ for crystallization trials.The purification conditions of HadAB in each step was summarized in Table 1.

# 2.3. Crystallization

Initial crystallization screening was carried out at $1 6 ^ { \circ } C$ by the hanging-dropvapor-diffusionmethodin96-wellplates (XtalQuest） using a MosquitoTM liquid-handling system （TPP Labtech). Each hanging drop was set up by mixing $2 0 0 { \mathrm { n L } }$ protein solution $\mathrm { \Omega } ^ { \prime } 1 0 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ ）with $2 0 0 { \mathrm { n L } }$ reservoir solution. The reservoir solutions were from commercially available crystallization screening kits(Index,SaltRx,PEG/Ion,PEG/Ion 2,Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen2and Natrix;Hampton Research).Crystalsappeared in several conditions after a few days.Subsequent optimizations were carried out by varying the variety and concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG)，protein concentration and the $\mathsf { p H }$ of the reservoir solution.Final optimized crystals for data collection were obtained from a condition consisting of $6 ~ \mathrm { m g } ~ \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ protein, $2 6 \%$ (w/v) PEG 4000, $1 0 0 \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES, $\mathsf { p H 7 } . 5$

# 2.4.Data collection and processing

Data collection was performed at $1 0 0 \mathrm { K }$ on beamline BL17U at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility(SSRF)after crystalswere soaked in the reservoir solution supplemented with $2 0 \% ( \mathrm { v / v } )$ glycerol for $1 0 s$ and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals diffracted X-rays to $1 . 7 5 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ resolution and a data set was collected.HKL2000 [25] software was used for data processing.

# 3.Results and discussion

Our previous work indicated that,when HadB was expressed alone,most of the His-tagged product was inclusion body,and thepurifiedprotein wasrelativelyunstablein solution. Meanwhile,although HadAB complex could be obtained bya tandem expression method,we were unable to get high quality crystals from this sample by reason of the His-tag fused onto HadA. To improve our sample,co-expression was performed for GST tagged HadB and none tagged HadA.Purer HadAB complex was successfully overexpressed in E. coli and obtained.It is more conducive to crystallization and qualified diffraction data collection.

After expression,the protein was purified to homogeneity by utilizing a series of chromatographic techniques which included GSTaffinity purificationat first usinga Glutathione Sepharose column (GE Healthcare),ion exchange chromatography next using a HiTrap Q HP and a Resource Q anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare）and size-exclusion chromatography finally using a Superdex 75 1O/3oO GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). GST affnity chromatography could remove most of impure proteins.However,this process will lose a lot of target protein because of insufficient Prescission Protease digestion (Fig.2).After two kinds of anion exchange chromatography purification,redundant HadA and most of the molecular chaperone could be separated (Fig.3a and b).If either HiTrapTM QHP or RESOURCETM Qwas used, even twice,purification effect will be reduced.Remarkably,the HadAB complex elution performed as a perfect single peak during gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4).The final purity of sample aftergel filtrationas estimatedby SDS-PAGEwas ${ > } 9 5 \%$ .An equal molar ratio of HadA and HadB for complex formation could be deduced from SDS-PAGE as well (Fig.4).An elution peak volume of ${ \mathfrak { g } } _ { . 3 } { \mathrm { m L } }$ corresponded to an approximate molecular mass of $6 5 \mathrm { k D a }$ based on calibration of the column using standard molecularweight markers.Given the theoretical molecular weight of HadAB complex is $3 2 . 5 \mathrm { k D a }$ ,ourresult indicated that HadAB exists asa tetramer at $1 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$

After initial crystallization screening,crystals were obtained in one of the conditions consisting of $2 2 \% ( w / \nu )$ PEG 3000, $1 0 0 \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES, $\mathsf { p H 7 } . 5$ after 2 days of incubation at $1 6 ^ { \circ } C$ After multiple optimization of crystallization conditions,crystals grew up to $5 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (Fig.5a).This crystal diffracted $\mathsf { X }$ -raysto $1 . 7 5 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ resolution on beamline BL17U at SSRF(Shanghai, China)(Fig.5b).A data set was collected and the statistics of data collection are listed in Table 2.The crystal belonged to space group $P 4 _ { 1 } 2 _ { 1 } 2$ ，with unit-cell parameters $a = b = 8 2 . 0 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ $c = 1 3 9 . 8 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ $\mathcal { \alpha } = \beta = \gamma = 9 0 . 0 ^ { \circ }$ .A Matthews coefficient of $3 . 5 6 \mathring { \mathsf { A } } ^ { 3 } \mathsf { D } \mathsf { a } ^ { - 1 }$ [26,27], corresponding to a solvent content of $6 5 . 4 9 \%$ ，indicated the presence of both one molecule of HadA and HadB per asymmetric unit.

In subsequent studies,an anomalous data set collected using crystals of selenomethionine labeled HadAB was used for phasing bysingle-wavelengthanomalous diffraction(SAD) method.A total of four selenium sites were located by SHELX program suit [28] and the phase was solved.A density map was created by using intensities in the collected data and the solved phase.The 3D structural model of HadAB was builtaccording to the densityand refinement is currently in progress.Expectingly,the crystal structure of HadAB will help us understand the mechanism of substrate dehydration as well as biosynthesis of mycolicacids,and also lay the foundation for anti-TB drug discovery.
