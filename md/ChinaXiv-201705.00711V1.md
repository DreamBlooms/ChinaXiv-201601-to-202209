The genetic program of embryonic stem (ES)cells is orchestrated bya core of transcription factors that has OCT4, SOX2,and NANOG as master regulators.Protein levels of these core factors are tightly controlled by autoregulatory and feed-forward transcriptional mechanisms in order to prevent earlydifferentiation.Recent studieshave shown that knockdown of Esrrb (estrogen-related-receptor $\pmb { \beta }$ ),amember of the nuclear orphan receptor family,induces differentiation of mouse ES cells cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor.Itwas however not known how knocking down Esrrb exertsthis effect.HereinwehaveidentifiedtwoESRRB binding sites in the proximal $5 ^ { \prime }$ -untranslated region of the mouse Oct4 gene,one of which is in close proximity to a NANOG binding site.Both ESRRB and NANOG are necessary for maintaining the activity of this promoter in ES cell lines.We have also demonstrated that the two transcription factors interact through their DNA binding domains.This interaction reciprocally modulates their transcriptional activities and may be important to fine-tune ES cell pluripotency.Supporting all of these data,stable transfection of Esrrb in ES cell lines proved sufficient to sustain their characteristics in the absence of leukemia-inhibitory factor.In summary,our experiments help to understand how Esrrb coordinates with Nanog and Oct4 to activate the internal machinery of ES cells.

Two defining properties of $\mathrm { E S } ^ { 3 }$ cells are the capacity to generate all cell types of an organism (pluripotency) and the ability to remain in a proliferative undifferentiated state (self-renewal).Despite the existence of differences,both human and mouse ES cells obtained from the inner mass of blastocysts can be cultured for prolonged periods of time without losing these two characteristics (1-3).Remarkably,the successful reprogramming of somatic cells to an embryonic-like state by nuclear transfer or less efficiently by fusion with ES cells demonstrated that specific factors exist in these cells that not only maintain but also can induce pluripotency $( 4 - 7 )$ . Understanding the molecular principles governing ES cell pluripotency is of outstanding interest for clinical purposes,as for example it may allow faithful differentiation into specific lineages or tissues. Recent large scale studies involving DNA microarray analysis upon forced differentiation of ES cells,chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip analysis,RNA interference,and proteomics approaches,have proven very powerful to gain insight into the internal machinery of ES cells (8-1O).These and other reports have shaped an interlaced transcriptional network orchestrated by three transcription factors: OCT4, SOX2,and NANOG (11).A substantial proportion of the genes targeted by the three factors are transcription factors as well，making understandable how three proteins alone can control the complex ES cell behavior.Remarkably, the levels of these core factorsmust be tightly coordinated to prevent early differentiation．Forexample，repression orinactivation ofOct4 differentiates ES cells along the trophoectodermal lineage, whereas high levels of Oct4 can also cause differentiation mainly into primitive endoderm-like derivatives (12). OCT4, SOX2,and NANOG frequently co-occupy the promoters of their target genes and also bind to their respective own promoters to modulate their own expression.In addition,all three factors can bind to and activate the Oct4 promoter(11).

As the amount of knowledge has increased, new constituents have been added to the ES cell pluripotency network, among whichareTcf3,Rest,andEsrrb(8,9).Tcf3andRestactatleastin part by controlling the transcription levels of the main core factors (13,14).

ESRRB and the related $\operatorname { E S R R } \alpha$ and $- \gamma$ share significant homology with the estrogen receptor and belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors (l5).They are classified as orphan receptors because they bind to DNA and are transcriptionally active in the absence of identified exogenous ligand (l6). ESRRB can be co-immunoprecipitated as part of the protein complexassociated with NANOG in ES cells (1O),but the functional significance of this interaction was not known.In addition,Esrrb knockdown using either short hairpin RNAlentiviruses or small interfering RNA oligonucleotides induces ES cell differentiation(8,9).Possiblyrelated to this,Esrrb is essential foradequate placental development, with Esrrb null mutant mice displayingabnormal trophoblast proliferation and precocious differentiation toward the giant cell lineage (17). In this report,we have investigated how Esrrb relatesto the fundamental ES cell regulators Oct4 and Nanog and have also demonstrated that forced expression of Esrrb alone is enough to maintainES cell characteristics.

# RESULTS

ESRRB andNANOG Interact through Their DNA Binding Domains-Previously，immunoprecipitation and subsequent mass spectrophotometry analysis has identified ESRRB as a putative NANOG-interacting protein (1O).We verified this interaction in mouse CGR8 ES cells by immunoprecipitation with antiNANOG oranti-ESRRB and Western blotting (Fig.1). Next, we mapped the domains involved in this interaction. Deletion mutants of NANOG and ESRRBwereoverexpressedin HEK293T cells, which do not express endogenous ES cell markers (e.g. Nanog or Oct4). Deletions N1,N3, N4, N5, N6,and FG-CD of NANOG; and deletions E1-E5 of ESRRB are represented in Fig.2,A and $B$ NANOG N1, N3, N4,and FG-CD have been described by us before (18); FG-CD is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and a FLAG tag. NANOG N5 and N6 have an aminoterminal green fluorescent protein and a Myc tag.ESRRB full-length is fused to either Myc or FLAG.All ESRRB deletions are fused to an amino-terminal FLAG tag.Western blotting with anti-NANOG,anti-Myc, or anti-FLAG antibodies showed efficient expression of these constructs (Fig. $^ { 2 , A }$ and $B _ { . }$ ). Full-length NANOG (N) was co-immunoprecipitated with full length ESRRB-FLAG (E),and the interaction wasmaintained with ESRRB deletions E1 and E5 but not with deletions E2-E4,which lack all or part of the DNA binding domain (Fig. 2C). NANOG full-length and deletions N1,N2,N3,and N6,but not N5 (lacks DNA binding domain), coimmunoprecipitated with ESRRBFLAG (Fig. $2 , D$ and $E _ { \mathrm { { \ell } } }$ . Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies ofcellsoverexpressing NANOG

FG-CD and Myc-ESRRB (Myc-E) demonstrated that ESRRB does not interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of NANOG (Fig. 2F).Taken together,our results indicate that the interaction between ESRRB and NANOG is mediated through their respective DNA binding domains.

moderately inducedESRRB mediated-transcriptional activity in P19 and F9 cells and more potently in CGR8 ES cells (Fig. $3 D _ { \cdot } ^ { \cdot }$ ).Thissynergistic effect was more dependent on the CD2 domain of NANOG than theWR,sinceitwasabolished when NHWVP16 (which only lacks CD2) wasoverexpressed together with ESRRB and the pS2 reporter (Fig. $3 D _ { , } ^ { \cdot }$ ).Hence,the interaction between ESRRB and NANOG has the potential to reciprocally modulate the transcriptional activityof both.

ESRRB and NANOG Independently Activate Oct4 Transcription—Given the above results,we speculated that ESRRB might be controlling ES cell behavior by binding to and activating the promoters of key ES cell core factors. We chose Oct4 as a putative target because tight control of Oct4 levels is essential to prevent ES cell differentiation (12).Using the MAT-INSPECTOR program (Genomatix)，we identified two degenerate ESRRB DNA binding sites (ESRRB-P2 and ESRRB-P1) (25) in the mouse proximal Oct4

ESRRB and NANOG Reciprocally Modulate Their Transactivation Ability in Pluripotent Cells-NANOG was originally described as a transcriptional repressor (23,24).We have previously reported that it can also act as a potent transactivator (18),thanks to two unusually potent transactivation domains (WR and CD2) located in the carboxyl-terminal edge (see Fig. 2A).We thus hypothesized that the interaction between ESRRB and NANOG might result in increased transcriptional activity of the latter,since this could potentially explain why Esrrb knockdown induces ES cell differentiation.Paradoxically, forced expression of Esrrb in CGR8 and mouse embryonic carcinoma cell lines (P19 and F9) repressed the activation mediated by NANOG of a reporter gene containing NANOG binding sites (Fig.3A).A similar experiment was performed using chimeric proteins ofNANOG that lack either the CD2 terminal domain (NHWVP16) or the entire carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain (CD1,WR,and CD2) (NHVP16) and are fused to the viral VP16 transactivation domain (see scheme in Fig. 3B).Western blotting showed potent expression of both NANOG fusion proteins in HEK293T cells (Fig.3B).ESRRB reduced the activity of both NHWVP16 and NHVP16 in pluripotent cells (Fig.3C),demonstrating that the repressive effect does not involve the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of NANOG.

ESRRB can bind to specific DNA response elements and activate transcription (e.g. in the case of the pS2 gene) (22).We evaluatedwhetherNANOGcouldinfluence ESRRB transactivation ability in this setting.Forced expression of NANOG promoter (Fig. 4A).ESRRB-P1 is located near a putative NANOG site.Specific binding of ESRRB or NANOG to these sequences was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with labeled oligonucleotide sequences that comprise either ESRRB-P2 or ESRRB-P1 or the NANOG binding site.Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with Myc-Esrrb or Nanog.ESRRB bound to both ESRRB-P1 and ESRRB-P2，and NANOG bound to its putative cognate sequence (Fig. 4B). Binding was effectively eliminated in both cases when anti-Myc or anti-NANOG antibodies were added to the reaction mixture (Fig.4B).ChIP analysis of CGR8 cells stably expressing MycEsrrb (to increase efficiency of the capture) further demonstrated that both ESRRB-P2 and P1 are bona fide ESRRB binding sites (Fig. 4C). Only the DNA fragment containing the NANOG binding site could be immunoprecipitated with anti-NANOG antibodies in CGR8 cells stably expressing NANOG-Flag (Fig.4C).We next used a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the Oct4 promoter described in Fig.4A (see the scheme in Fig. 5A).Overexpression of Nanog and Esrrb activated the Oct4 promoter reporter in F9 when transfected individually,but co-transfection did not result in synergybut rather in antagonism (Fig.5B).This effect could be related to the above described interplaybetween ESRRBand NANOG.Overexpression of either transcription factor in CGR8 cells could only activate the Oct4 reporter modestly (data not shown)，which is probably due to high levels of endogenous Esrrb and Nanog. We therefore mutated

ESRRB-P1 and ESRRB-P2 or the NANOG binding site; the latter 2 mutations had a potent effect in reducing the basal activity of the Oct4 promoter in CGR8 cells (Fig. 5C).In conclusion,ESRRB and NANOG independently bind to and activate Oct4 transcription.

Esrrb Can Sustain ES Cell Pluripotency and Self-renewal in the Absence of LIF-To investigate whether Esrrb alone is sufficient to maintain ES cell characteristics,we stably transfected CGR8 (Fig.6) and E14T cells (Fig.7) with either empty vector or Esrrb.The resulting cell lines were then cultured in the presence or absence of LIF for 6 days,after which cell morphology and AP activity were evaluated (Figs. $6 , A$ and $B$ 0 and 7,A and $B$ ).AP staining was high in Esrrb-overexpressing ES cells cultured without LIF and faint or absent in the control. Esrrb-overexpressing colonies also retained the classic compact morphology with welldefined bordersofdedifferentiated ES cell colonies，whereas control cells were flat and displayed abundant cytoplasmic prolongations.Real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of ES cell marker genes,including Nanog and Rex1,demonstrated comparablelevels in Esrrb-stable ES cell lines cultured with or without LIF (Figs. 6C and 7C).LIF depletion in Esrrb-stable ES cellsdid not influence mRNA levels of genes (Fgf5 and T) known to increase after ES cell differentiation (Figs.6C and 7C).In addition,immunofluorescence staining for NANOG and OCT4 showed homogeneous high levelsin ESRRB-overexpressing CGR8 cells cultured without LIF and low in the control (Fig. $6 D _ { , } ^ { \prime }$ ）

# DISCUSSION

The list of proteins involved in controlling ES cell behavior is growing steadily. In many cases, like it happens with ESRRB,it is poorly understood how they exert their roles.ESRRB has been reported to interact with the ES cell master regulator NANOG (10).Multiple other proteins also interact with NANOG, and some of them are also transcription factors.It is,for example,the case of Dax1,Sall4,and NF- $\cdot \kappa \mathrm { B }$ (10,26,27). Small interfering RNA for Daxl or Sall4 induces differentiation of ES cells (28，29)．Dax1 belongs，like Esrrb，to the family of orphan nuclear receptors and has a known role in the establishment and maintenance of steroid-producing tissues like the testis and the adrenal gland (30).How Daxl helps control pluripotencyisprobablyunrelated to its role in steroidogenesis.Sall4 isa member of the Spalt-like familyof proteins; Sall4 co-occupies with NANOG the promoters of many genes and is needed for NANOG-mediated transactivation of these targets (26).High levels of NF- $\kappa \mathrm { B }$ induce differentiation of ES cells by activating lineage-specific programs. NF- $\kappa \mathrm { B }$ binds to the WR transactivation domain of NANOG,and this results in repression of the transcriptional activity of the latter (27).

ESRRB can bind to specific DNA recognition sequences and is transcriptionally active in the absence of exogenously added ligand.Two ESRRB binding sites were identified in the proximal mouse Oct4 promoter,one of which is responsible for maintaining Oct4 transcription together with NANOG. The positive effect of ESRRB on Oct4 may on its own explain

whysmall interferingRNAfor Esrrb inducesdifferentiation. Further supporting this idea,we have demonstrated that overexpression of Esrrb alone is able to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in ES cells in the absence of LIF(see the scheme in Fig. 8).While our manuscript was under review,ChIP-on-chip analysis in mouse ES cells demonstrated the existence of ESRRB binding sites through the whole genome (31).Many of these potential ESRRB target genes comprise OCT4, SOX2,and NANOG-regulated genes and include the respective promoters of these core ES cell regulators too.Also,van den Berg etal.(32) demonstrated that ESRRB binds to Nanog,Rest,and Rex1 promoters.For the former twopromoters,bindingofESRRB to its cognate sequence required Oct4 being bound to a nearby site. Thiswas,however,not needed for ESRRB binding to the Rex1 promoter.Paradoxically,ESRRB was capable of transactivating Nanog and Rexl promoters but not Rest. In the context of our study, ESRRB could repress the ability of NANOG to transactivate a NANOG reporter gene,whereas NANOG had the opposite effect on ESRRB.This suggests that the interplay between both factors mayreciprocallyaffecttheirability to activate common targets and thus fine-tune ES cell pluripotency.But this interplayis likely to be target-specific and complex. Likewise,it is conceivable that the numberofESRRB-interacting proteins in ES cells will extend beyond OCT4 and NANOG in the same way that most ES cell transcription factors interact with and cross-regulate each other.Future work will be important to evaluate these considerations.
