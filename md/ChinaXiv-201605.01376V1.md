Notably, ERAdP interacts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (Ubc13) to potentiate its charging activity. Thus, ERAdP augments Ubc13-mediated $\mathbf { N F - \kappa B }$ essential modulator ubiquitination to trigger the Ubc13- mediated NF $\mathbf { \sigma } \cdot \mathbf { \kappa } \mathbf { B }$ pathway,leading toNKcellactivation.Finally,ERAdP transgenic mice display hyperactivatedNKcells that aremoreresistanttopathogenic ifectionsTherefore,understandingthemechanismofERAdP-mediatedNKcellactivationill provide strategies for treatment of infectious diseases.The Journal of Immunology,2015,194:1292-1303.

$\mathrm { N }$ （20 atural killer cells,a major innate immune component,are defined as large granular lymphocytes,representing the third largest lymphoid cell population in mammals,and are critical in innate immune responses (1,2).Cytokine secretion and direct killing are the two major effector functions of NK cells (3), acting as the first line of defense against pathogen infection and transformed tumors.NK cells can directly eradicate transformed orvirus-infected cells very effectively (4-6).These functions are mediated by a series of germline-encoded receptors to deliver activating or inhibitory signals (7,8).Besides their cytotoxic activity, NK cells robustly produce vast amounts of cytokines and chemokines (1, 3). $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ produced by NK cells has been proven to exert critical roles in defense against pathogens as well as in immune regulation(9-11).However, the molecular mechanisms of NK cell activation have not yet been fully defined.

NF ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { { k } } \bf { { B } }$ was first reported to recognize the enhancer sequences in the gene encoding the $\mathrm { I g } \kappa \mathrm { L }$ chain in B lymphoma (12).The NF- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { \times }$ pathwayplays a pivotal role in $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ production of NK cells.After ligand binding or target cell adhesion,the NK cell surface receptors initiate an intracellular signaling cascade involving the activation of several majorkinases and signaling complexes,ultimatelyleading to ${ \mathsf { N F } } { \mathsf { \kappa } } { \mathbf { \kappa } } { \mathbf { B } }$ activation．The ligand binding initially activates the receptor-associated Src kinases to phosphorylate Carmal.Carmal phosphorylation promotes the Carmal/BcllO/Malt1(CBM) complex assembly,which recruits the ubiquitination machine E3 (TNFR-associated factor [TRAF]6)/E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 [Ubc13])complex and the ${ \tt N F - } \kappa { \tt B }$ essential modulator (NEMO,also called IkB kinase $\mathrm { [ I K K ] } \gamma ) / \mathrm { I K K } \alpha / \beta$ (IKK) complex (13).The ubiquitination of NEMO and phosphorylation of $\mathrm { I K K } \alpha / \beta$ lead to full activation of the IKK complex and subsequent phosphorylation,which causes ubiquitination and degradation of its substrate $\mathbf { I } \ltimes \mathbf { B } \ltimes$ (14)，a cytoplasmic inhibitor of ${ \tt N F - } \kappa { \tt B }$ ， $\mathbf { I } \ltimes \mathbf { B } \ltimes$ degradation releases the ${ \tt N F - \tt { K B } }$ and the free ${ \tt N F - \kappa B }$ is phosphorylated,which enters the nucleus to initiate target gene transcription.

The IKK complex is a central regulator of the ${ \tt N F - } { \tt \ l } \kappa { \tt B }$ pathway, acting as a major target for ubiquitination and phosphorylation regulation.TRAF6 is the E3 ligase of NEMO and mediates its K63-linked ubiquitination,which transduces activating signals to initiate activation of the IKK complex (15,16).Ubc13 has been defined as the E2 ligase of this process and is an essential component of the ubiquitination machinery for ${ \tt N F - } \kappa { \tt B }$ activation (15, 17,18).Ubc13 deficiency in thymocytes leads to abolished ubiquitination of NEMO and phosphorylation of TGF $\cdot \mathsf { \{ \_ { \beta } } $ -activated kinase1(19).Ubc13 forms a complexwith Uevla (human homolog of yeast Mms2) as an E2 ligase (20,21).In the E2/E3 complex,TRAF6 selects substrates and Ubc13 ingeniously determines the linkage specificity and the length of polyubiquitin chains(18,22-24).Ubc13 was reported to be important for TCR signaling of Tlymphocytes (19).However,itisunclear whether and how Ubc13 is involved in NKcell activation.In this study,we identified a novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein,which we call ER adaptor protein (ERAdP).ERAdP is constitutively expressed in NK cells.ERAdP interacts withUbc13 to activate the Ubc13-mediated ${ \mathsf { N F } } { \bf { \cdot } } { \bf { \kappa } } { \bf { B } }$ pathway,leading to NK cell activation.

# Results

ERAdP is a conserved ER membrane protein and is constitutively expressed inNK cells

We previously demonstrated that chronic HBV carriers and HBVassociated HCC patients display low rates of granzyme $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { H } } ^ { + }$ NK cells in the periphery and in livers (5).We then carried out DNA microarray analysis of peripheralNK cells fromHBV-associated HCC patients versus healthy donors.We analyzed differentially expressed genes in HBV-associated HCC patients.Among the lowly expressed differential genes,we focused on a novel gene

variantof TMEM188.We cloned the full length of the new variant TMEM188,called ERAdP,which wassubmitted to GenBank (FJ516381.1).ERAdP was highly expressed in peripheral NK cells in healthy donors(Supplemental Fig.1A) but was downregulated in HBV-associated HCC patients,as was the case with immune effector molecules such as perforin and granzyme H(5).These data suggest that ERAdP may positively regulate NK cell activation.

ERAdP contains 125 aa residues and is highly conserved in vertebrates.It shares the same protein sequence as its mouse ortholog, ${ \sim } 9 7 . 6 \%$ sequence identity with the frog,and even $5 3 \%$ identity with the fly(Supplemental Fig.1A).ERAdP mRNAwas ubiquitouslytranscribed inavarietyof mouse tissues,butitwas highly expressed in immune-related organs (Fig.1A).Notably, ERAdP mRNA was highly expressed in NK and $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells in wild-type mice (Fig.1B).In contrast,it was lowly expressed in other immune cells,including $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ T cells,B cells,monocytes, and neutrophils.Similar results were also observed in human counterpart cells (data not shown).

Because ERAdP has two putative transmembrane domains (Supplemental Fig.1B),we next examined its exact cellular localization.We overexpressed ERAdP in human NKL cells with a Flag tag and observed that ERAdP was localized on the ER membrane,but not on the mitochondria or early endosomes (Fig. 1C).These observations were further verified by organelle fractionation analysis ofNKL cells(Fig.1D).Additionally, to further determine whether the two transmembrane domains of ERAdP were essential for the ERlocation,we overexpressed ERAdP in human 293A cells with an enhanced GFP tag.ERAdP residing in the ER was also displayed in 293A cells (Supplemental Fig.1C). Importantly,deletion of each transmembrane domain of ERAdP abolished its ER residence (Supplemental Fig.1D),suggesting that both of the transmembrane domains were essential for ER

# ERAdP initiates IFN-γ production ofNKcells

To determine functions of ERAdP in NK cells,we knocked down ERAdP expression in human NKL cells and established stable ERAdP-silencing cell lines (Fig.2A).PMA and IONO can directly activate protein kinase Ckinases to induce NF- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { \times }$ activation inlymphocytes.After PMA/IONO treatment,ERAdPsilenced NKL cells dramatically declined $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ generation both in mRNA and protein levels compared with those of scramble shRNA-treated cells (Fig.2B). These phenomena were confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig.2C).To exclude off-targeting effects of shRNA-mediated gene silencing，we designed two independent shRNA sequences against ERAdP mRNA and both of them effectively silenced ERAdPand $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ expression in NKL cells (datanot shown).Additionally,we still checked TNF- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha }$ and GMCSFproduction after ERAdP depletion.We noticed that ERAdP silencing also reduced the production of TNF $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha }$ and GM-CSF (data not shown).NK cells use various receptors to recognize their corresponding ligands for NK cell activation. Synergistic coactivation by NKG2D and 2B4 receptors was reported to activate NK cells and induce $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ production (25).We found that ERAdP-silenced NKL cells secreted much less $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ by crosslinking with NKG2D and 2B4 receptors (Fig.2D). These data suggest thatERAdP facilitates $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ secretion of NK cells in both PMA/IONO stimulation and physiological crossinking of the activation receptors.

We next transfected NKL cells with lentivirus encodingERAdP and obtained NKL cell lines stably overexpressing Flag-ERAdP (Fig.2E).With PMA/IONO treatment,ERAdP overexpression remarkably increased $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ expression compared with those of empty vector-transfected Ctrl cells (Fig.2F, 2G)．Additionally, ERAdP overexpression also increased the generation of TNF- $\mathbf { \alpha } _ { \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \alpha } _ { \mathbf { \alpha } } }$ and GM-CSF (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by crosslinking NKG2D and 2B4 receptors (data not shown).In summary,ERAdP can induce NK cell activation to promote cytokine secretion.

# ERAdP-mediated IFN-y production requiresthe NF-kB activation pathway

To examine whether ERAdP regulates the ${ \mathsf { N F } } { \bf - } { \bf \kappa } { \bf B }$ pathway,we preincubated NKL cells with the ${ \mathsf { N F - } } { \boldsymbol { \kappa } } { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { B } } }$ inhibitorBAY11-7085 before PMA/IONO stimulation.Interestingly,we found that the NF- $\mathbf { \nabla \cdot } \kappa \mathbf { B }$ inhibitor completely blocked ERAdP-mediated $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ production (Fig.3A-C).However, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin had no such activity (Fig.3B,3C). Consequently，the phosphorylation of p65 occurred more rapidly at early time points in cells overexpressing ERAdP (Fig.3D).However,ERAdP-silenced NK cells almost blocked the phosphorylation of p65 (Fig.3E),as well as the phosphorylation of $\mathbf { I } { \ltimes } \mathbf { B } \mathbf { \alpha }$ (Fig.3F).Additionally, ERAdP silencing did not affectPI3KorERK signalingpathways (Fig.3G).These data indicate that ERAdP specifically facilitates the NF- $\mathbf { \nabla \cdot } \kappa \mathbf { B }$ activation pathway.

# ERAdP activates the NF ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot \kappa B$ pathwayvia regulation of NEMO ubiquitination

Activation of the NF ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { { B } }$ pathway encompasses several key steps, including the CBMcomplex assembly,phosphorylation of $\mathrm { I K K } \alpha / \beta$ and ubiquitination of NEMO (also called $\mathrm { I K K } \gamma$ ). Intriguingly, Carmal assembled the same amount of BcllO/Malt1 subcomplex in ERAdP-silenced NKL cells as did that of scramble-treated $\mathrm { { C r l } }$ NKL cells (Supplemental Fig.2A).Furthermore,phosphorylation of $\mathrm { I K K } \alpha / \beta$ was comparable in ERAdP-silenced compared with scramble-treated Ctrl NKL cells (Supplemental Fig.2B). However, ERAdP silencing significantly declined ubiquitination of NEMO compared with scramble-treated Ctrl NKL cells (Supplemental Fig. 2C). These results suggest that ERAdP activates the NF- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { \bf { \kappa } } \kappa \bf { \Lambda } \cdot \kappa \bf { \Lambda }$ pathwayvia modulation of ubiquitination of NEMO.

# ERAdPinteractswithUbcl3tomediateK63-linked ubiquitinationofNEMO

Todetermine the molecular mechanismofERAdP-mediated NF$\kappa \mathbf { B }$ activation pathway,we screened a human spleen cDNA library to identify ERAdP's interacting protein by using a yeast twohybrid assay.Ubcl3 was identified as an interacting protein of ERAdP (Fig. 4A).Ubc13 was reported to catalyze K63-linked polyubiquitin chains for many important proteins as an E2 ligase(16).DeletionofUbc13 in Tlymphocytes causes defective ubiquitination of NEMO and abolishes activation of ${ \mathsf { N F - } } { \boldsymbol { \kappa } } { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { B } } }$ signaling(19).Thus,we proposed that ERAdP may activate NK cells through theUbc13-mediated NF- $\mathbf { \nabla \cdot } \kappa \mathbf { B }$ activation pathway.We found thatrecombinantFlag-ERAdPandUbc13-Hiscan directlyinteract with each other (Fig.4B).Moreover,their interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in 293T cells (Fig.4C）and NKL cells (Fig. 4D).With PMA/IONO stimulation, the association of endogenous ERAdP and Ubc13 was dramatically augmented in NKL cells (Fig.4D). These data suggest that NK cell activation can enhance the association of ERAdP and Ubc13.

Ubc13 binds Uevla to form the E2/E3 complex with TRAF6. Ubc13 and TRAF6 were reported to mediate ubiquitination of NEMO (16). We proposed that ERAdP may promote NEMO ubiquitination via the assistance ofUbc13.Surprisingly,we found that ERAdP markedly strengthened the association among Ubc13 with Uevla and TRAF6 (Fig.4E,4F),suggesting that ERAdP helped the assembly of the Ubc13 ligase complex.Importantly, ERAdP significantly facilitated TRAF6- and Ubc13-mediated ubiquitination of NEMO(Fig.4G).Additionally, ERAdP specifically enhanced K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO,but not K48-linked ubiquitination (Fig. 4H).

To verify these observations,we established an in vitro ubiquitination reconstitution assay.Incubation of all the essential recombinant components catalyzed the ubiquitination of NEMO (Fig.4I). Actually,ERAdP indeed promoted NEMO ubiquitination (Fig. 4I). More importantly,ERAdPcould enhanceUbc13-mediated ${ \tt N F - } \kappa { \tt B }$ reporter activation through luciferase reporter assays (Fig.4J).In summary,ERAdP interactswithUbc13 to facilitate K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO.

# ERAdP potentiatesthe charging activity ofUbc13

Ubc13 was reported to be regulated by deubiquitylase A20 (29). A20 can target Ubc13 for K48-linked ubiquitination to mediate its proteasomal degradation,leading to downregulation of ${ \tt N F - } \kappa { \tt B }$ pathway.We found thatUbc13 and TRAF6 were very stable after $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ stimulation with PMA/IONO (Fig.5A,5B),and ERAdP silencing or overexpression did not alter the stability ofUbc13 and TRAF6.These data suggest that the regulation of Ubc13 stability is not involved in the ERAdP-induced NF- $\mathbf { \nabla \cdot } \kappa \mathbf { B }$ activation pathway.

We next established an in vitro ubiquitin charging assay to determine whether ERAdP influence the charging activity of

Ubc13.Intriguingly,we found that ERAdP significantly enhanced the charging activity of Ubc13 (Fig.5C).Furthermore,ERAdP increased the Ubc13 charging activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5D).A chemical inhibitor(NSC697923) of Ubc13 was reported to inhibit the charging activity of Ubc13 and ${ \mathsf { N F - } } { \boldsymbol { \kappa } } { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { B } } }$ activation (3O).We found that the inhibitor NSC697923 completely abolished the ERAdP-augmented charging activity of Ubc13 (Fig. 5E). The $\mathrm { C y s } ^ { 8 7 }$ mutation abolishes enzymatic activity of Ubc13(16).We observed thatthe inactive C87A-Ubc13 mutant abolished the charging activity of Ubc13 (Fig. 5F). Importantly, the C87A-Ubc13 mutant failed to catalyze NEMOubiquitination through an in vitro reconstitution assay system (Fig.5G).Moreover，the C87A-Ubc13 mutant abolished ERAdP-reinforced NEMO ubiquitination (Fig. 5G). These data indicate that the charging activity of Ubc13 is required for its enzymatic activity. Taken together,ERAdP acts as an activator to enhance Ubc13 charging activity.

# Ubcl3isrequiredforERAdP-initiatedIFN-yproduction of NKcells

To examine whether Ubc13 is involved in NK cell activation,we silencedUbc13 expression in NKL cells and established stable Ubc13-silenced NKL cell lines (Fig.6A). Interestingly,Ubc13 depletionalmost blockedNEMOubiquitination withPMA/IONO stimulation (Fig. 6B).Additionally,Ubc13 silencing significantly declined $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ production of NK cells (Fig.6C),which is similar to ERAdP depletion. These results were verified by flow cytometry assays (Fig.6D).Furthermore，the Ubc13 inhibitor NSC697923 completely blocked NEMO ubiquitination with PMA/IONO treatment in NK cells(Fig.6E) or phosphorylation of $\mathbf { I } { \ltimes } \mathbf { B } \mathbf { \alpha }$ (Fig. 6F). Accordingly， the Ubc13 inhibitor NSC697923 abolished $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ production of NK cells (Fig. 6G). The ${ \mathsf { N F } } { \bf - } { \bf \kappa } { \bf B }$ inhibitor disrupted $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ production of NK cells as a positive Ctrl (Fig.6G).These data suggest thatUbc13 is required for $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ production in NK cells.

Tofurther confirm that Ubc13 is required for ERAdP-mediated activation of NK cells,we silenced Ubc13 in ERAdP-overexpressingNKL cells (SupplementalFig.3A).Intriguingly, Ubc13 depletion remarkably impaired ERAdP-induced $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ production(SupplementalFig.3B).Consistently, the Ubc13 inhibitor NSC697923 completely abolished the ERAdP-induced $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ secretion (Supplemental Fig.3C).In summary,Ubc13 is required fortheERAdP-induced $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ secretion in NK cells.

# ERAdPTgmice harborhyperactivatedNKcellsthat facilitate NKcell-mediated immunity

To further explore the physiological function of ERAdP in vivo,we tried to generate ERAdPknockout mice.However, full deletion of $E R A d P$ caused early embryonic lethality at embryonic day 6.5.Then we intended to establish ERAdP Flox mice for getting conditional knockout mice,but we failed after trying several strategies.Instead,we generated Flag-ERAdP Tg mice with a CD2 promoter-driven construct. Given that a Tg mouse model demonstrates overexpression of ERAdP in WT mice,we used the

ERAdP Tg mice only to explore the relevantly physiological function of ERAdP in bacterial clearance.Flag-ERAdP was overexpressed in primary NK cells of ERAdP Tg mice (Fig.7A). Absolute numbers of mature NK cells $( \mathrm { C D 3 ^ { - } N K 1 . 1 ^ { + } D X 5 ^ { + } } )$ in the periphery and spleen were similar in $\mathrm { T g }$ mice compared with littermate Ctrl mice (Fig. 7B).However, Tg NK cells generated much more $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ than did Ctrl NK cells with PMA/IONO stimulation (Fig.7C).Moreover,Tg NK cells caused increased ubiquitination of NEMO(Fig.7D）and concomitantly led to higher phosphorylation of $\mathbf { I } \ltimes \mathbf { B } \ltimes$ (Fig.7E),suggesting that ERAdP Tg NK cells reinforce $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ production through the NF- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { \times }$ activation pathway.

L.monocytogenes can effectively infect immunocompromised hosts (including humans and mice) mainly by contaminated food. NK cells contribute to the first defense against $L .$ monocytogenes infection via $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ secretion (9).Depletion of NK cells or $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ resulted in severe exacerbation of $L .$ monocytogenes infection and death in mice (31).We used the $L .$ monocytogenes infection model to detect whether ERAdP-induced $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ secretion exerted a critical role in the defense against $L$ .monocytogenes infection.We i.p.infected mice with a lethal dose of $L$ monocytogenes.Fourteen of16 littermate Ctrl mice died within 1Od(Fig.7F),whereas only 5 Tg mice died until day 1O.We depleted NK cells by i.p. injection of anti-Asialo GM1 mAb.We found that the resistance of $\mathrm { T g }$ mice against L.monocytogenes infection was impaired upon depletion of NK cells (Fig. 7G),indicating that NK cells provided protection against $L .$ monocytogenes infection.

To further confirm that $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ plays a critical role in defense against $L .$ monocytogenes infection,we infected mice with a sublethal dose of $L$ monocytogenes.As expected, $\mathrm { T g }$ mice harbored amuchlowerL.monocytogenes load in spleens and livers than did Ctrl mice (Fig.7H).Additionally, Tg mice had much more activated NK cells to generate $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ in spleens after early $L$ monocytogenes infection compared with Ctrl mice (Fig.7I).Accordingly, the $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ level was much higher in $\mathrm { T g }$ serum than in that of in Ctrl mice (Fig.7J).Finally,through in situ histological staining，we observed more $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ expression in splenic NK cells of Tg mice than that of $\mathrm { C t r l }$ mice after $L .$ monocytogenes infection (Fig. 7K).In summary,ERAdP-induced NK cell activation in $\mathrm { T g }$ mice is more resistant to $L$ .monocytogenes infection.

# Discussion

NK cells play a pivotal role in the innate and adoptive immune responses through direct killing and cytokine secretion (2,6).NK cell activation is controlled bya variety of activating and inhibitory receptors.However, the precise molecular mechanisms driving defined NK functions remain largely elusive.In this study,we identified a novel ER membrane protein,ERAdP,which is constitutively expressed in human and mouse NK cells.ERAdP is expressed atlowlevels inperipheral NKs ofHBV-associatedHCC patients,which is reminiscent of low expression of immune effector molecules such as perforin and granzyme H(5).We identified that ERAdP interacts with Ubc13 to potentiate its charging activity (Fig.7L).Thus,ERAdP augmentsUbc13-mediated NEMO ubiquitination to trigger the Ubc13-mediated NF ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { \times }$ pathway, leading to NK cell activation.Importantly,ERAdP Tg mice have hyperactivated NK cells that are more resistant to infections.

Bcl10,a caspase recruitment domain(CARD) protein,associates with Malt1 adaptor protein as a major regulator of TCR- and BCR-mediated NF- $\mathbf { \nabla \cdot } \kappa \mathbf { B }$ activation (32,33).Carma1 (also termed CARD11 and Bimp3) interactswithBcl10 through CARD-CARD interaction.These three proteins form the CBM complex (34,35). Ligand engagement first activates the receptor-associated Src kinases to mediate phosphorylation of Carmal.Carmal phosphorylation initiates the CBM complex assembly,which recruits the ubiquitination machine E3(TRAF6)/E2(Ubc13) complex and the IKK complex(13). The ubiquitination of NEMO and phosphorylation of $\mathrm { I K K } \alpha / \beta$ lead to full activation of the IKK complex and subsequent ${ \bf N F - \kappa B }$ activation.Hara et al.(36) reported that Carmal or BcllO deficiency abolishes cytokine/chemokine production of NK cells owing to impaired ${ \mathsf { N F - } } { \boldsymbol { \kappa } } { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { B } } }$ activation, suggesting that the CBM complex may play an important role in NK cell activation.In this study we observed that ERAdP did not affect the assemblyof the CBMcomplex,butit facilitated the NEMO ubiquitination by promoting the charging activity of Ubc13.Moreover,ERAdP could positively induce cytokine production ofNK cells,which is reminiscent of the CBM complexmediated NF- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { \times }$ activation pathway (37,38).

Ubc13hasbeenreported to be regulatedbydeubiquitylase A20, OTUB1,and the Shigella flexneri effector OspI (29,39,40). A20,together with TAX1BP1,interacts with Ubc13 and UbcH5c, resulting in its ubiquitination for degradation,which downregulates NF- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \kappa } \bf { \times }$ activation (29).OTUB1 directly binds to and inhibits Ubc13 to suppress double-stranded break-induced histone ubiquitination,independent of its deubiquitylase activity (4O).The interaction of OTUB1 andUbc13 positions the N-terminal helix of OTUB1 to interfere with Uevla binding to Ubc13 and the subsequent attack on the thioester bond by the Uevla-linked acceptor ubiquitin.Recently, OspI was reported to suppress the TRAF6- mediated signaling pathway and restrain acute inflammatory responses against bacterial infection (39).OspI is a glutamine deamidase and deamidates the residue $\mathbf { G } \mathbf { l u } ^ { 1 0 0 }$ of Ubc13 to form a glutamic acid residue.This modification abolishes the ubiquitin charging activity of Ubc13,leading to inactivation of the ${ \mathsf { N F - } } { \boldsymbol { \kappa } } { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { B } } }$ pathway.In this study,we showed that ERAdP directly binds to Ubc13 and potentiates its charging activity as a positive regulator. ERAdP robustly interacts with Ubc13 after NK cell activation upon PMA/IONO stimulation or crosslinking with activating receptors.Actually,ERAdP was observed to bind Bcl1O after NK cell activation (data not shown).Given that the CBM complex was reported to recruit TRAF6/Ubc13 complex,it is possible that the assembled CBMcomplex in activated NKcells acts as a scaffold to mediate ERAdP-Ubc13 interaction.This phenomenon needs further investigation.

Secretion of soluble cytokines by NK cells in early innate immune responses significantly impacts the recruitment and function of other hematopoietic cells to exert their physiological roles. Besides promoting $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ production,ERAdP could induce secretion of othercytokines such as TNF- $\mathbf { \sigma } \cdot \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \cdot } \mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { \cdot } \mathbf { \alpha }$ and GM-CSF(data not shown). $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ is mainly produced by NK cells at early stages of a variety of immune responses (41,42). $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ can act directly on $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells to increase their numbers upon viral infection (43). We previously showed that $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ produced by NK cells exerts a crucial role for the priming of CTL responses for tumor rejection (6).Many studies showed that NK cells and secreted $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ are implicated in the resistance against several infectious diseases,including CMV,HIV,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, $L .$ monocytogenes, and hepatitis virus (9-11).In this study,we showed that ERAdP Tg mice augment NK cell activation and $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ generation that exert a critical role in the eradication of intracellular pathogens such as L.monocytogenes.We are still investigating the ERAdP-induced eradication of virus infection.Therefore,understanding the mechanism of ERAdP-mediated NK cell activation will provide strategies to treat infectious diseases for future clinical implications.
