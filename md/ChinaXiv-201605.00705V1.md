Abstract:A novel cleavable amphiphilic peptide(CAP) was designedtobespecificallyresponsivetofibroblastactivation protein-a (FAP-a),a protease specifically expressed on the surfaceofcancer-associatedfibroblasts.TheCAPself-assembled into fiber-like nanostructures in solution，while the presence of hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs readily transformedtheassembliesintodrug-loadedspherical nanoparticles. The disassemblyof these nanoparticles(CAP-NPs) uponFAP-acleavage resulted inrapid and efficientrelease of theencapsulated drugs specifically at tumor sites. This Transformers-likedrugdelivery strategycould allow themto disrupt thestromal barrier and enhance local drug accumulation. Therapeutic results suggested that drug-loaded CAP-NPs hold promising tumor specificity and therapeutic efficacy for various solid tumor models,confirming its potential utility and versatility in antitumor therapy.

Ntee seenas particularlypromising for cancer therapy because of their great potential for improving drug specificity, biocompatibility,pharmacokinetic features,and antitumor efficacy.[1] However,for most particulate-based drug carriers,the heterogeneity among tumor cells and the presence of complex stromal cell barriers are still great challenges limiting their tumor-targeting and -penetrating performances,[2.3] and strategiesto overcome tumorheterogeneity and to break stromal barriers are urgently needed.[2,4] Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs),the predominant cell type in the tumor stroma[5] form a major barrier that impedes penetration of nanoparticulate therapeutics and even molecular drugs into solid tumors.[ Compared to tumor cells that show diverse marker proteins among different tumor types,CAFs selectively overexpressed certain proteins,such as $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { a }$ -smooth muscle actin ( $\mathrm { { ^ a } }$ -SMA)and fibroblast-activated protein $\alpha$ (FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ ),in almost all solid tumors but not normal tissues.[5,7,8] Consequently, development of smart nanomaterials responding to CAFs may be a specific and efficient strategy to overcome the aforementioned obstacles,leading to increased drug perfusion and improved antitumor efficacy.

Peptides and peptide derivatives,owing to their biocom patibility,chemical versatility,and biological recognition abilities,have been widely utilized as building blocks to construct soft functional biomaterials for specific applications,such as tissue engineering and drug delivery.[9] Extensive studies have demonstrated that tailor-made peptides can self-assemble into unique secondary structures or nanostructures.[10] Moreover, certain peptides derived from degradation or cleavage of antibodies or collagens exhibit specific targeting capacity and enzymatic activity.[11] These features render peptides extremely useful in the construction of versatile, multi-functional,and stimuli-responsive nanostructures for drug delivery and release,12] especially in tumor tissues overexpressing proteases.

Herein we report a novel CAF-targeting drug delivery nanosystem based ona cleavable amphiphilic peptide (CAP) designed to be specifically responsive to FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ ,amembranebound serine protease specifically expressed on CAFs.[13] In aqueous solution, CAP monomers readily self-assembled into nanofibers because of their amphiphilicity,which would transform into spherical nanoparticles(NPs) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs. When entered into tumor stroma,the CAP molecules were cleaved by FAP- $\mathrm { \bf { a } }$ ,losing amphiphilicity and causing the NPs to rapidly disassemble, thereby discharging their cargoes. This stimulus-responsive nanocarrier is potentially applicable for the delivery of a broad spectrum of poorly soluble chemotherapeutic drugs, being able to greatly enhance tumor targeting and drug deliveryefficacy.AsFAP- $\alpha$ is specifically expressed and activated on CAFs in over $90 \%$ of human carcinomas,[8] aFAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ -targeting drug delivery system can be particularly desirable in establishing an efficient treatment of a broad range of cancers.

The CAP monomer had a sequence of Ac-Ala-ThrLys(C18)-Asp-Ala-Thr-Gly-Pro-Ala-Lys(C18)-Thr-Ala- $\cdot \mathrm { N H } _ { 2 }$ and displayed a Gemini-like structure (Figure 1a).[14] Its hydrophilic domain contains the amino acid residue sequence Gly-Pro-Ala-X that can be specifically cleaved by FAP- $\mathbf { \alpha } _ { \mathrm { ~ \mathfrak { ~ a ~ } ~ } }$ [13,15] Three threonines(Thr） containing hydroxy groups were added into the hydrophilic domain to increase its hydrophilicity,and an aspartic acid (Asp) containing carboxyl group was incorporated to provide negative charges for the hydrophilic head at $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 4$ ,to decrease nonspecific phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system (RES）and prolong blood circulation time in vivo.[16,17] The N-terminus was protected with acetyl(Ac） to avoid undesirable cleavage by the lymphatic vessel-expressed protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV),which shares the same substrateswithFAP $\mathrm { \bf { a } }$ but is unable to cleave N-terminus blocked peptides.[18] Furthermore, two octadecanoic acid chains were linked to the sidechains of the lysine residues of CAP to form the hydrophobic domain.We also synthesized an un-cleavable amphiphilic peptide(UAP) (Supporting Information,Figure S1a） with a similar structure and sequence of CAP as a control.The purity ofCAPand UAP was over $9 5 \%$ (Figure S1b,S1c). The responsivenessof CAPandUAP towardsFAP- $\alpha$ and DPPIV was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Figure S2).After incubation with FAP- $\mathrm { \ a u }$ for $^ { 3 \mathrm { h } }$ ,the peak of CAP( $M = 1 7 0 5 )$ ）disappeared with the emergence of two fragment peaks ( $M 1 = 6 5 5$ ， $M 2 = 1 0 6 8$ ),which correspond to the two predicted digested segments: Ac-Ala-Lys(C18)-AspAla-Thr-Gly-Pro-OHandAla-Lys(C18)-Thr-Ala- $\cdot \mathrm { N H } _ { 2 }$ .When CAP was incubated with DPPIV, the peak $M = 1 7 0 5$ remained and no other peaks emerged, indicating that CAP cannot be cleaved by the non-tumor related enzyme DPPIV. Asexpected,UAP exhibited no responsiveness towards either FAP- $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { a }$ or DPPIV.Both CAP and UAP have low critical micelle concentration(CMC) (CAP, $0 . 6 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ ； UAP, $0 . 8 9 \mu \mathrm { M } ,$ ）inPBS buffer (Figure S3),implying that they are able to self-assemble into core-shell structures at concentra tions equal to or above the CMC.

The drug loading capacity of CAP was first studied with the hydrophobic drug doxorubicin (Dox).Dox and CAP were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted in water. Afterbeingultrasonicated for3minand furtherincubated for $^ { \textrm { 1 h } }$ ，the product exhibited a mixture of multi-shaped nanostructures,including nanofibers,spherical NPs and mace-like structures,as demonstratedby transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements(Figure 1b,I).However，the assembled product transformed into uniform NPs after prolonged ultrasonication (Figure 1b,II). Thus,we hypothesize that the encapsulation of drugs by amphiphilic peptides may involve three processes (Figure 1c):peptide self-assembly into fiber-like structures,co-assembly of hydrophobic Dox and peptides into spherical NPs,and Dox-induced reassembly of nanofiber into NPs.

Further investigation was then carried out on the selfassembly behavior of engineered amphiphilic peptides. According to Israelachvili's surfactant number theory,[19,20] both the CAP and UAP monomers have a dimensionless packingparameter $P$ 0 $P = \nu / a l$ ；where $\nu =$ volumeofhydrophobic tail, $a =$ area of hydrophilic head group, and $l = \mathrm { m o } .$ nomer length） between O.5 and 1 because of their short hydrophilic domains yet long hydrophobic tails (CAP, $P =$ 0.58; UAP, $P { = } 0 . 5 6$ ),which predictsa tendency to form fibershaped micelles during self-assembly.Thiswas confirmed by TEM analysis that showed that in the absence of Dox, CAP dynamicallyself-assembled intowell-ordered, thinnanofibers (Figure 2a). Morphologies of intermediate products suggested a possible multi-phased mechanism of CAP selfassembly (Figure S4a).Initially, disordered peptide monomers assembled into loose peptide aggregates (transient state I),driven by both the hydrophobic interactions among alkyl chains and intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between amide groups. The alkyl chains were then driven closer, expelling water out of the aggregates and causing them to gradually shrink,which leads to the transformation of the aggregates to long and thin fiber-like structures with water completely expelled from the hydrophobic core (transient state II).Finally, the resulting nanofibers were dispersed, capable of forming stable structures owing to their negatively charged surfaces,provided by the Asp carboxyl group side chains. The UAP had a similar self-assembly process with CAP(Figure S4b).The height of these nanofibers,as measured by atomic force microscope (AFM),was approximately $4 \mathrm { n m }$ (Figure S5),confirming the formation of nanofibers bya monolayer of CAP molecules.

However,when Dox was added into the system,the assembled product changed from nanofibers to nanospheres. It is easy to imagine that amphiphilic peptide monomers could directly encapsulate the drug through a one-step coassembly process,where hydrophobic drug molecules form the hydrophobic cores that induce the alkyl chains of peptide to assemble around them (Figure 1c).Nonetheless, since selfassembly of peptide and co-assembly of peptide and drug simultaneously occurred during drug loading,a reassembly of the self-assembled peptide nanofibers upon interaction with the drug was probably involved. To exploit the reassembly process, diverse small molecular weight hydrophobic drugs were incubated with CAP in aqueous solution under ultrasonication for different time intervals and the morphologies of the assembled products were observed.After co-incubation of CAP with Dox for $1 \mathrm { m i n }$ ，silkworm cocoon-like structures emerged among nanofibers (Figure 2b).When the ultrasonication time was increased to $3 \mathrm { m i n }$ ,the amount of nanofibers significantly decreased and many spherical particles appeared.After $5 \mathrm { m i n }$ or longer ultrasonication time, nanofibers disappeared and were ultimately transformed to spherical NPs. The morphology of the NPs was unchanged even after incubation with serum for $4 8 \mathrm { h }$ (Figure S6), indicating their high stability under physiological conditions. Substituting Dox with two other first-line chemotherapeutic drugs,irinotecan (Iri) and paclitaxol (Tax)，also elicited similar morphological changes during the drug loading process,except that longer ultrasonication was needed in their cases to form the spherical structures (Figure S7),which may be due to different physiochemical properties of these hydrophobic drugs.On the other hand,without hydrophobic drugs, the nanofibers did not change their shape even after longer time of ultrasonication (Figure S7),suggesting that hydrophobic drugs are necessary to the described morphological transformation.These observations are consistent with the proposed mechanism of the drug-induced reassembly process (Figure 1c):ultrasonication increased the collision between hydrophobic drug molecules and nanofibers, during which the drug molecules inserted into the inner hydrophobic part of these fibers, forming hydrophobic cores. These drugincorporated cores induced the rearrangement of surrounding peptide monomers through the hydrophobic driving force, resulting in the transformation into stable spherical NPs.

Taken together, these data indicate that we have successfully constructed a nanocarrier for delivery of hydrophobic drugs using a FAP- $\mathrm { \ a u }$ responsive peptide CAP. With proper size (sub-1OO nm; Table S1),zeta potential (negative charges, Table S1)，capacity of encapsulating hydrophobic drugs (Table S2),aswell as specific responsivenessto CAFs,these drug-peptide complexes hold great potential to be used for antitumor therapy.

Figure 3.a) Morphology changes of peptide nanocarriers upon reaction with FAP $\alpha$ (TEM).Scale bar: $\mathsf { 1 0 0 } \mathsf { n m }$ .b) The drug release profiles of CAP-Dox and UAP-Dox in the presence or absence of FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$

Efficient and specific drug release is considered essential fora drug delivery nanosystem to achieve high therapeutic efficacy. In our study,we found that FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ was able to completely dissociate Dox-loaded CAPNPs (CAP-Dox) into disordered structures,but had no effect on the morphology of Dox-loaded UAP NPs(UAP-Dox)(Figure 3a).Without FAP- $\alpha$ ，both CAP-Dox and UAP-Dox released Dox at similarly low rates (less than $40 \%$ in $4 8 \mathrm { h }$ ） (Figure S8).In contrast, CAP-Dox released almost all loaded drugs within $^ { 3 \mathrm { h } }$ after FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ treatment,while UAP-Dox maintained the slow Dox release rate (Figure 3b).This rapid drug release behavior of CAP-Dox in response to FAP $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ was attributed to FAP- $\alpha$ triggered CAP cleavage,resulting in two segments with unbalanced hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (Fig ure S9).These structures are unable to maintain a stable assembly or reassembly status.With rapid and efficient enzymatic response,our nanosystem is expected to greatly increase the effective drug concentration at the FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ -rich tumor sites, thus enhancing drug delivery/perfusion.

Most nanostructures with negative surface charge have been reported to suffer low cellular uptake.[21] To investigate the interaction between our drug-loading nanosystem and cellsin vitro,we first incubated CAP-DoxorUAP-Doxwith CAFs, PC-3 (a prostate cancer cell line) or human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs),and assessed the cellular uptake of encapsulated Dox (Figure S1O).Results showed that after CAP-Dox treatment for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ ,CAFs with high expression of FAP- $\alpha$ exhibited a pronounced intracellular Dox signal while only a small amount of Dox signal was observed in the FAPα negative cell lines,PC-3 and HUVEC(Figure S11).Even after incubation for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ ,the Dox signal was still very weak in PC-3 and HUVECs while most of the CAFs had been killed (Figure S1O).In comparison,all three types of cells only showed minimal Dox signal when treated with UAP-Dox, likelydue to the lack ofa cleavage site forFAP- $\alpha$ in UAP. These results are consistent with the difference between drug release profiles of the two NPs, suggesting that the high drug release efficiencyof CAP-Dox would result in increased cellular uptakeofdrugs.Importantly, when examined by cytotoxicity assays,CAP-Dox showed specific and dose-dependent cytotoxicity to CAFs and no significant toxicity to either PC-3 or HUVECs (Figure S12),confirming the specificityof FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a }$ responsive Dox releasefromCAP-Dox.As expected, UAP-Doxhad no observable toxicity to any of the three cell types.We next used a coculture system(CAFs $+$ PC-3 cells) to simulate a tumor environment enriched with CAFs in vitro (Figure S13).AfterCAP-Dox treatment for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ ,a significant cellular uptake of Dox was observed in both cell types.In contrast, little Doxuptake was detected in UAPDox treated cells. These results imply that other than selective drugrelease atCAF-present tumor sites to avoid off-target effects，the specific response of CAP-Dox to FAP- $\mathrm { \ a u }$ also allows the released Dox to act on not only CAFs but also the co-existing tumor cells.

Subsequently,we assessed the tumor targeting and biodistribution of engineered nanocarrier in vivo.Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate（TRITC）and Black Hole Quencher(BHQ-1） were encapsulated in CAP,fabricating ananoprobe(CAP-RB，Figure S14),[22] which can be activated by FAP-a. The in vivo imaging indicated that the tailor-made peptide nanocarrier specifically released its cargoes at the tumor site in the CAF-rich tumor model (Figure 4a). The biodistribution results illustrated that CAP NPs possessed not only excellent tumor specificity but also low non-specific organ accumulation (Figures S15,S16).

Scale bar: $5 0 \mu m$

Drug delivery efficiency of the CAP nanocarriers to tumors was investigated by intravenous injection of free Dox, CAP-Dox and UAP-Dox (the same Dox dose, $5 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,was used in all formulations) into mice bearing CAFs and PC-3 co-implants. After $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ post-injection, tumors were resected and sectioned,and the tumor blood vessels werelabeled with CD31 antibody. Confocal microscopy images showed a gradient of Dox fluorescence from the tumor edge to the core that was much wider and stronger in CAP-Dox-treated tumors compared to either UAP-Dox or free Dox-treated groups (Figure 4b,Figure S17).Although free Dox also exhibited a degree of diffusion into tumors,its penetration distance was much shorter than that of CAP-Dox，as demonstrated by the fluorescence distribution across the tumor tissue. This was probably caused by the low tumor targeting efficiency of Dox togetherwith the drug expelling effect of high interstitial pressure.In UAP-Dox treated tumors,fluorescence of Dox was detectable only at the tumor edge and with very low intensity,because of inefficient drug release and poor penetration through the stromal barrier.

Having confirmed the capacity of CAP-Dox to effectively release drugs and enhance drug delivery to tumors,we further examined its antitumor therapeutic efficacy. Mice were coinoculated with CAFs and PC-3 cells to establish a xenograft prostate tumor model with enriched CAFs. When tumors reached an average volume of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ ，the mice were randomly divided into five groups $( n = 8 )$ ）and intravenously injected withPBS (control),CAP,Dox,CAP-Dox,orUAP

Dox every three days( $\mathrm { 5 m g k g ^ { - 1 } }$ Dox per injection). Tumor volumes were measured and calculated post treatment (Figure 4c). CAP-Dox significantly inhibited tumor growth after only two injections and gradually reduced tumor volume with subsequent treatment,exhibiting much superior antitumor effects to free Dox.In comparison,tumor growth in the UAPDox-treated group was only slightly suppressed. After four injections,tumor tissues were resected and subjected to H&E staining,immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of CAFs by labeling $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { a }$ -SMA,[23] and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling（TUNEL）staining for apoptosis (Figure 4d and Figure S18). Compared to the control group, free Dox and UAP-Dox only showed a mild antitumor activity, both eliciting little change in tumor morphology, limited reduction of CAFs and no apparent apoptosis. In contrast, the morphology of tumors in the CAP-Dox-treated group dramatically changed, with most cells in an apoptotic state.Furthermore,the typical morphology of CAFs disappeared after CAP-Dox treatment (Figure S18 and Figure 4d). The percentage of apoptotic cells determined in each group also supported the above observations (Figure S18),as the TUNEL-positive cells in CAP-Dox treated tumors had a percentage about $6 5 \pm 6 . 8 \%$ ，much higher than those in other groups (control, $7 \pm 2 \%$ ； Dox, $1 8 \pm 3 . 4 \%$ ; UAP-Dox, $1 1 \pm 2 . 5 \%$ ).These results suggest that the CAP-Dox nanosystem selectively and effectively respond to CAFs for drug release,and demonstrate promising antitumor efficacy.

Considering the cardiotoxicity of Dox and the distribution of CAP-NPs in liver and kidney for a certain period,[24] in vivo side effects of the peptide nanocarrier were evaluated (Figure S19).The control group showed a small degree of morphological differences,with only the liver showing some apoptotic areas.However,no obvious morphological changes were observed in the UAP-Dox or CAP-Dox treated groups, indicating the minimal side effects of our designed peptide nanocarrier.

We further identified the versatility of the CAP nanosysteminanother two xenograft tumormodels,MCF-7breast tumor and Mia-paca-2 pancreatic tumor.Although both tumor cell lines were FAP- $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { a } _ { } $ negative, they ultimately formed tumors that exhibited positive FAP- $\alpha$ expression (Figure S2O),indicating the presence of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment.When we used CAP nanoparticles loaded with Tax or Iri to treat breast or pancreatic tumors, respectively, tumor growth was almost completely inhibited. The antitumor efficiency of CAP-NPs was much higher than that of UAP-NPs or free drug (Figure S21). These data further suggest that our CAP nanocarrier is of great potential for treatment of a wide range of solid tumors that contain or recruitFAP- $\alpha$ positive CAFs.Furthermore,the stability and responsive properties of CAP-NPs in blood (Figure S22) imply the potential opportunity to apply CAP-NPs in clinical cancer therapy.

Insummary，using the self-assembly propertiesof a designed amphiphilic peptide,we developed a smart Transformers-like drug delivery system based on a cleavable amphiphilic peptide that specifically responded to FAPα expressed on CAFs in the tumor microenvironment, achieving enhanced drug delivery and promising antitumor effects.The nanocarrier exhibited an interesting morphological transformation during the loading of hydrophobic drugs, and was able to rapidly disassemble upon cleavage by FAP$\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ to release the drug,facilitating drug penetration into the tumor microenvironment. In vivo fluorescence imaging showed that the CAP nanocarrier possesses excellent tumor targeting specificity,which significantly reduced the side effects of the encapsulated chemotherapeutics on normal tissues.We believe that our study demonstrated the potential utility of tumor microenvironment-responsive drug delivery nanosystems in enhancing both specific delivery and tumor penetration for antitumor therapy.
