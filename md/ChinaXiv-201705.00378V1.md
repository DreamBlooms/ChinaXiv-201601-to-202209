Many chemotherapeutics used forcancertreatments encounterisues during delivery to tumorsin vivo and have high levels of systemic toxicity.One of the most prominent progresses in improving drug delivery efficiency is through exploring various types of nanoparticles (NPs)as drug cariers. Recent studies have demonstrated that titanium dioxide $( \mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } )$ nanocarriers have potential for drug deliveryand therapy even in multidrug resistant cancers in vitro.Moreover,it was proved that the anticancer activity of doxorubicin (DOX) was enhanced by loading onto $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanoparticles in breast cancer cells in vitro.However, there is no evidence from the animal model in vivo,which isa critical stepfor their further clinical applications. The aim of this study was to explore novel $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } \mathsf { - P E G - D O X }$ nanoparticles,the DOX loaded polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanocarriers,and investigate their potential application in enabling controlled drug release and enhancing the chemotherapeutic effcacy of DOX in the orthotopic breast tumor bearingmice.The tumor growth and drug treatment efficacy were dynamicallymonitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI),and the safety of NPs for in vivo usage was also evaluated.It was found that $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 } \mathsf { - P E G - D O X }$ nanoparticles possessed improved antitumor efficacy without observable side effects compared to the free DOX treatment.Our study suggested that the PEG coated $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanocarrier is a safe and potential platform for the eficient drug delivery and minimizing the systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents.It has been proved for the first time that $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -based nanocarriers enhance the chemotherapeutic effects of doxorubicin in vivo.

# 1.Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality among women worldwide,and the frequency keeps increasing.1-3 Chemotherapy is a major clinical approach for cancer treatment by using cytotoxic antitumor drugs. Traditional chemotherapeuticsare usually nonspecifically distributed in the whole body through blood circulation,which may cause systemic side effects.The poor specificity and limited accumulation of anticancer drugs in tumor regions cause various adverse side effects,such as myelosuppression,gastro intestinal distress,alopecia,organ damage,etc. These effects can cause pain in patients and eventually the failure of therapy.4,5 The use of various pharmaceutical nanocarriers has become one of the most important areas of nanomedicine. Ideally,such carriers can be specifically delivered to the pathological areas to provide the maximum therapeutic efficacy. Therefore,it prompted scientists to explore the feasibility of developing nanoparticles as effective drug delivery vehicles to overcome the limited therapeutic eficacy of free drugs and circumvent their toxicity.

The prominent progress of nanomedicine is through the continuous development of nanoparticle (NP)-based therapy, which exhibited the potential for unparalleled performance over conventional tools.67 The development of nanotechnology driven drug delivery holds the potential for revolutionizing cancer chemotherapy.'By controlling the nanoparticle size,the drug delivery efficacy to the tumor sites can be greatly increased through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is due to tumor vasculature abnormalities and reduces the drug's cytotoxicity simultaneously.' Particularly, inorganic

NPs have received great attention due to their outstanding properties.Inorganic NPs can be designed to enhance the accumulation of drugs at the tumor sites when administered in vivo.The unique size scale of inorganic NPs can enable their preferential accumulation in the tumor region through EPR effects.1° A variety of inorganic nanocarriers,such as iron oxide, mesoporous silica， graphene oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles,have been studied for successful drug delivery and therapy in cancer treatment.11-6 Furthermore，metal nanomaterials have also been widely studied as drug carriers, which represent a promising approach to tumors.17,18 The titanium dioxide $\left( \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \right)$ nanoparticle possesses many attractive features such as excellent biocompatibility,low toxicity,high chemical stability,and unique photocatalytic and sonocatalytic properties.Therefore,ithas received much attention in the field of photodynamic therapy and sonodynamic therapy of cancer, even in the field of potential multimodal therapy agents.19 Based on its unique properties,the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanoparticle also draws much attention in the field of drug delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs.20-24 For example,Yan Chen et al. constructed a $\mathbf { D O X - T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanoparticle as a drug delivery system,and the results showed that the anti-cancer efficacy of the drug per dose dramatically increasedinhumanSMMC-7721hepatocarcinoma cells.25It was found that $\mathbf { F e } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 } @ \mathbf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ core-shell nanocomposites with $6 { - } 8 ~ \mathrm { ~ n m }$ diameter have been explored as carriers for DOX delivery in drug-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells.16 In addition,Wenzhi Ren et al. reported an enhanced doxorubicin transport to multidrug resistant breast cancer cells via $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanocarriers.26

However until now,there has been no report on the application of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -basednanocarriersintheanimal model,whichis acritical step tolearnhow theybehaveinvivo for theirfurther clinical applications.Therefore，novel $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEG-DOX nanoparticles were constructed and characterized in this study,and itishypothesized that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNPs were able to increase the specific targeting of DOX at the tumor site in vivo,increasing treatment efficacyand reducing the nonspecific toxicity to other organs.Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was coated onto $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ with the purpose of improving the stability of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -DOXNPs.It is also known that most nanomaterials,when administered into the blood,are taken up by phagocytic cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) in the liver and spleen within minutes orhours.The addition of PEG to the surface of nanomaterials can avoid their rapid clearance by the MPS.By preventing opsonization,the addition of PEG greatly increases the blood half-life of all nanomaterials and therefore enhances the accumulation of nanomaterials in tumor tissue.27-29

In this study,we investigate the potential application of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs in enabling controlled drug release and enhancing the chemotherapeutic efficacy of DOX in the orthotopic breast tumor bearing mice.In order to fully monitor tumor growth and examine drug treatment effects ina sensitive way，bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed on the orthotopic breast tumor-bearing mice during the whole15 day treatment. Optical molecular imaging,such as BLI, has several advantages over traditional methods,especiallyin the field of in vivo cancer research.It enables sensitive and longitudinal observation and has become an important tool for early lesion detection and monitoring therapeutic efcacy.30,31 The frefly luciferase labeled MDA-MB-231-GFP-fLuc breast cancer cell line was used in our study to establish the breast tumor animal model for in vivo experiments.Moreover, the H&E histologyand CD31 immunostaining of tumors and major organs were performed at the end of experiments to further evaluate the antitumor effcacy and the toxicity of different treatments.

# 2.2Preparation of $\mathbf { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEG-DOXnanoparticles

Nanoparticles $\left( \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \mathrm { N P s } \right)$ werepreparedbyour reported method with modification.26 Briefly, $\mathrm { T i C l } _ { 4 }$ was hydrolyzed and dialyzed in water,and then heated to improve the crystallinity of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs. The concentration of as-prepared $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs was $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ $\mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ which was determined by ICP-MS (NexION 30o,PerkinElmer,US).In order to improve the stability of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs,polyethylene glycol (PEG，molecular weight 15oo) was used to enwrap the nanoparticles. $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs $\left( 0 . 5 \mathrm { \ m g \ m L ^ { - 1 } } \right)$ were dropped into PEG solution,and stirred for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs were separated by centrifugation at $1 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ andweredispersed in $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ultrapure water. $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of DOX (1 $\mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 } )$ were drop-wise added into $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPsand stirred for another $2 4 \ \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .The obtained $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs were collected by centrifugation at $1 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and stored at $4 { \bf \nabla } ^ { \circ } { \bf C }$ ，Furthermore,free DOX in the centrifugal supernatant was also collected to measure the loading efficiency of DOX onto $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG.The absorption of DOX $( 0 - 1 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 } )$ at $4 8 8 \mathrm { n m }$ was determined using a UV-visible spectrophotometer.The doseabsorption curve of DOX was calculated according to the different absorptions of DOX at $4 8 8 \mathrm { n m }$ .The collected free DOX was determined usinga UV visible spectrophotometer,and the concentration of the free DOX was calculated by the doseabsorption curve of DOX.The loading efficiency of DOX onto $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } – \mathbf { P E G } =$ (total DOX - free DOX) $\div$ (amount of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } \dot { }$ ） $\times$ $1 0 0 \% = \left( 1 \mathrm { \ m g \ m L ^ { - 1 } \times 1 \ m L ^ { - 0 . 0 0 5 6 \ m g \ m L ^ { - 1 } \times 2 1 \ m L } } \right) \div$ 0 $0 . 5 \mathrm { \ m g \ m L ^ { - 1 } } \times 2 0 \mathrm { \ m L } \times 1 0 0 \% = 8 . 8 2 \%$ (Fig. 1).

The MDA-MB-231-GFP-fLuc cells were plated in 96-well plates (1 $\mathbf { \times \nabla _ { 1 0 } ^ { 4 } }$ cells per well) and cultured for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ . The cells were incubated with different doses of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGNPs,freeDOX or $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs for 24,48 and $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .The concentration of free DOX $( 0 - 1 0 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 } )$ was equal to the concentration of DOX in $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs. The dose of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs $( 0 { - } 1 1 3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ $\mathbf { m \mathbf { L } } ^ { - 1 } ,$ )was the same as that of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ in $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs.The viability of cells with different treatments was assayed by the

MTT assay.Briefly, $1 0 ~  { \mu \mathrm { L } }$ MTT $\left( 5 \mathrm { \ m g \ m L } ^ { - 1 } \right) .$ )reagentwasadded into eachwell andincubated for $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .Then DMsO wasused to dissolve the formazan crystals.The absorbance was measured using a Microplate Absorbance Reader (Biorad iMARKTM, USA).

4-5 week old athymic male $\mathbf { B a l b / c }$ nude mice $\left( n = 2 0 \right)$ ）were purchased from the Department of Experimental Animals, Peking University Health Science Center.All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC） at Peking University (permit number: 2011-0o39).Briefly，the orthotopic tumor model was established by injecting $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ MDA-MB-231-GFP-fLuc cell suspension $\ b { \mathrm { ~ \ b ~ { ~ 1 ~ } ~ } } \times \ b { \mathrm { ~ 1 0 ~ } } ^ { 6 }$ cells per mL) into the lower right mammary fat pad of the Balb/c nude mice.

# 2.8Drug administration

The mice with a similar tumor volume of $8 0 { - } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ were randomly divided into 4 groups (5 mice per group) after tumor cell inoculation. The $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ ，free DOX and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treatment were given via tail vein injection.The doxorubicin dosage in free DOX treatment was $4 ~ \mathrm { m g } ~ \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }$ and was administered every 3 days during the 15 day treatment period. The amount of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ 0 $4 5 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } )$ was equivalent to that used for the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP groups.The control group received an equal volume of $0 . 9 \%$ saline.

The mice were fasted overnight before the experiment to prevent food from interfering with imaging results.The mice were anesthetized with $2 \%$ isoflurane and received intraperitoneal injection of $8 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ Dluciferin solution $( 4 0 \mathrm { \ m g \ m L ^ { - 1 } } ) _ { \mathrm { \ell } } ,$ 1 $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ before BLI was started. The mice were kept in the supine position.The parameters for the BLI imaging system were binning $= 4$ and exposure time $= 1$ S.

# 2.11Histology of major organs and tumor tissues after different treatments

Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE staining) were performed for histological evaluation of major organs and tumor tissues after different drug treatments.The cryosections were rinsed with distilled water and stained with hematoxylin,followed by rinsing with running tap water.After differentiation in $0 . 3 \%$ acid alcohol and another rinse,the sections were stained with eosin for $2 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .Finally,the sections were consecutively dehydrated,cleared and mounted,and were examined under an optical microscope (Leica,DMi3000).

# 2.12Immunofluorescence staining of CD31 on tumor tissues after drug treatment

The tumor tissues were dissected out and frozen in the optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Leica,Germany）after drug treatment.The tumors were cryosectioned (Leica CM1950,Germany) for $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ thickness and all the slides were stored in a $- 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ freezer before staining.The sections were fixed in acetone for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and stained with the primary antibody of rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences,USA) overnightat $4 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } .$ Donkeyanti-ratAlexaFluor $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ 488 (Invitrogen,USA) was stained as the secondary antibody for $^ { \mathrm { ~ 2 ~ h ~ } }$ at room temperature.Negative control was performed with omitting the primary antibody and incubated with secondary antibody only.

As shown in Fig.2，the average hydrated diameter of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs was about $1 2 6 \pm 2 . 6 \mathrm { { n m } }$ . After loading with DOX, thehydrated size of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNPswas increased to $1 5 1 \pm$

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1Characteristics of $\mathbf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNPs

Present authors'previous work had already shown that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -DOX NPs can increase the antitumor cell effects in multidrug resistant breast cancer cells in vitro.26 However there isno evidence about the antitumor effects of $_ { \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } - \mathrm { D O X } }$ NPsin vivo.Therefore,based on previous work,we further created novel $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs，which were modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating onto the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs (Fig.1),and tested this new nanosystem on the orthotopic breast tumor mouse model in vivo,which is necessary for the clinical translation of the NPs in the future.The addition of PEG to the surface of nanomaterials can avoid the rapid clearance by renal and reticuloendothelial systems (RESs),and greatly increases the blood half-life of all nanomaterials and therefore enhances the accumulation of nanomaterials in tumor tissue.27-29 In addition,PEG coated $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs may decrease the interaction

![](images/4bd75233af23fa8e7afee4a0980121cf63f1645517bfab3c6be74c2f99559d0f.jpg)  
Fig.4pH controlled drug release of $\mathsf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs.The DOX release profiles at pH 7.4,and $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 5 . 0$ are shown in black and red colored lines, respectively.

$4 . 6 \ \mathrm { n m }$ .The size of the NPs met the requirements of the EPR effect,which is favorable for the drug infiltration specifically at the tumor sites and correspondingly increase the chemotherapeutic efficacy.In addition,we further tested the stability of NPs,which is known to be critical to a successful drug delivery system.The results showed that the size of NPs did not show a great increase during 7 day culture in serum solution (Fig. 3), which suggested that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs were stable and can be administered intravenously in vivo.

The successful loading of DOX onto $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs was confirmed by UV-visible spectra and zeta potential analysis.As shown in Fig. S1, $\dagger$ the characteristic peak of free DOX occurred at about $4 8 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .Compared with $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs, $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGDOXNPs also possessed the peak of free DOX at around 488 nm,which suggested that DOX was adsorbed onto $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs.Furthermore,zeta potential analysis also indicated that DOX was bound onto $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs.As shown in Fig. S2, $\dagger$ owing to hydroxyl groups on the surface of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs,the zeta potential of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs was $- 3 3 . 5 7 \ \mathrm { m V }$ ata $\mathsf { p H }$ of 7.4. However, the zeta potential of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNPswas $- 2 6 . 2 7$ $\mathrm { m v }$ at the same pH value,which was due to the positive charges of amino groups in the DOX neutralized part of negative charges on the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGNP surface.Inaddition,ithas been considered that negatively charged nanocarriers exhibited resistance to adsorption of serum proteins,and therefore showed prolonged circulation time in blood which could enhance the accumulation of drugs in the tumor site.

# 3.2 Controlled drug release from $\mathbf { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNPsin vitro

Controlled release capabilities are critical for drug delivery nanocarriers,and the pH responsiveness is one of the most frequently used biological stimuli exploited for the triggered drug release.Lactic acid isusually generated due to hypoxia and acidic intracellular organelles inside tumors,lowering the pH values dramatically in tumor regions relative to normal areas, therefore the $\mathsf { p H }$ values vary in the different biological compartments and the cellular organelles.These conditions may affect the interaction of drug and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanocarriers and facilitate drug release.32,33 Our previous work suggested that the negativelycharged $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ surface could be turned into positive in an acidic environment,which attenuated the interactions between $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ and DOX enhancing the drug release.However,a previous report also suggested that due to the bare $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs without any surface modification,the adsorption between $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ and DOX was very strong. Therefore, only a part of the drug could be released even in the acidic environment of pH 5.o. In this work,to further weaken the interaction between $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ and DOX,and meanwhile,to increase the stability and blood halflife of the nanocarriers,PEG was used to coat $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ NPs to form $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGNPs.Therefore,in this study,the DOX release from $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs was evaluated in different phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) solutions $\mathrm { ( p H } 5 . 0$ and $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 4 \AA _ { , }$ ).As shown in Fig.4,cumulative release of DOX from $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPswas about $5 0 \%$ at $\mathrm { p H } = 7 . 4$ ,which was close to the pH of physio logical blood.However,around $8 0 \%$ of DOX was released at pH $= 5 . 0$ ，which imitated the $\mathsf { p H }$ value of tumors.The results indicated that the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP is a smart controlled release system,and could release DOX more specifically and effectivelyin an acidic tumor environment,whichis favorable for the controlled release and targeted chemotherapy and reducingits systemic toxicityinvivo.Therefore,PEG coating not onlyimproved the stability of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs,but also attenuated the interactions between the two components which boosted the drug release in an acidic environment compared with our previous work.26

The cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of DOX were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope, and the data showed a time dependent cellular uptake for both free DOX and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs.In the free DOX treatment group,most of the drug was located uniformly with Hoechst,which indicated that the free DOXwas accumulated in the nuclei of MDA-MB-231-GFP-fLuc cells at $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ (Fig. 5i-1). When the incubation time was prolonged from $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 4 h }$ more DOX was concentrated in the nuclei of cells (Fig. $\mathsf { 5 m - p }$ ） However,in the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treatment group,DOX was initially localized in the cytoplasm after $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ incubation (Fig. 5q-t)，because NPs were mainly distributed in the endosomes after taken up by the cells.While DOX was transported to the nuclei after $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ incubation with $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGDOX NPs,which suggested that the release of DOX from the NPs was prolonged in the acidic endosomes (Fig. 5u-x).

We further investigated the antitumor cell effects of free DOX or $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNPs on MDA-MB-231-GFP-fLuc breast cancer cells in vitro.As shown in Fig.6,the cell viability of cancer cells treated with free DOX or $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNPsboth significantly decreased compared to the treatment of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 ^ { - } }$ PEG NPs.At 24 and $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，free DOX exhibited stronger cytotoxicity compared to the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treatment. Around $9 1 . 2 2 \pm 1 . 0 2 \%$ of cells were killed at $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ during $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ $\mathrm { m } \mathbf { L } ^ { - 1 }$ of free DOX treatment. However,only $5 6 . 2 4 \pm 3 . 3 2 \%$ cancer cells were killed in the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNP treatment group at $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { h } }$ .At $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { { h } } }$ 5 $9 1 . 4 2 \pm 0 . 3 1 \%$ of cells were killed in free DOX treatment, while $9 8 . 0 8 \pm 0 . 2 9 \%$ cells were killed in $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ PEG-DOX NP treatment. The data suggested that $\scriptstyle \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } - \mathrm { P E G } -$ DOX NPs possessed prolonged drug release and higher antitumor cell capabilities.Taken together,these in vitro studies demonstrated that the antitumor efficacy of DOX was enhanced upon loading onto $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG nanocarriers.

# 3.3In vivo evaluation of tumor growth with different drug treatments

In this study,we proceeded to evaluate the antitumor treatment efficacy of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs in vivo in an orthotopic breast tumor-bearing mouse model,because it isa preferable animal model for simulating tumor development in human beings. To compare the therapeutic effects in different drug treatment groups, the tumor volumes were initially measured by using a digital caliper every3days,and the tumor volume changeswere calculated and presented as tumor volumeday15 - tumor volumedayo. The results showed that the tumor volume growth steadily increased for15 days in the control and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGNP treatment groups,and the tumor volume changes were $1 9 0 . 9 0 \pm$ $7 4 . 6 4 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ and $1 2 5 . 0 \pm 5 0 . 3 6 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ ，respectively.In the DOX treatment group,the tumor volume increased during the initial 6 days and then gradually decreased thereafter,and the tumor volume change was $5 6 . 1 9 \pm 3 1 . 8 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ after15days.While $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOXNP treatment significantly inhibited the tumor volume growth during the whole 15 day period,and the tumor volume change was only $2 4 . 1 0 \pm 1 9 . 6 2 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ .Theabove data suggested that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEG nanocarriers facilitated theantitumor efficacy of DOX in vivo (Fig.7).

It is known that optical molecular imaging such as bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was sensitive and accurate for the detection and monitoring of tumor growth compared to the traditional manual measurement. Because the BLI signal was derived from living tumor cells,it provided a quantitative surrogate measurement and reflected the number of living tumor cells.Therefore,in this study, the antitumor therapeutic efficacy was also examined dynamically by using BLI besides measuring tumor volumes using digital calipers.With the aid of fLuc labeled MDA-MB-231-GFP-fLuc cancer cells,the nude mice bearing orthotopic breast tumors displayed a strong BLI signal in the tumor regions. The BLI imaging of breast tumor bearing mice with different treatments is shown inFig.8.The BLI light intensity kept increasing in the control and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP treatment groups during the whole 15 day observation.In the free DOX treatment group,the BLI light intensity increased during the initial 6 day treatment，and then gradually decreased.The BLI intensity was maintained ata relatively low level in the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treated group suggesting a better tumor growth suppression effect compared with other treatment groups. The BLI intensity values of the control group and the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP group were $8 . 9 9 \pm 2 . 0 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ and $7 . 5 5 \pm 1 . 8 2$ $\times { 1 0 } ^ { 9 }$ photons per s per $\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ at day 15. The BLI intensity of the free DOX group was $1 . 7 7 \pm 1 . 3 8 \times { 1 0 } ^ { 9 }$ photons per s per $\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ at day 15,while the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treatment group was only $1 . 0 0 \pm 1 . 0 5 \times { 1 0 } ^ { 9 }$ photons per s per $\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ 0 $^ { * } P < 0 . 0 5$ $^ { * * } P < 0 . 0 1$ ！ (Fig.9).The BLI data,consistent with the manual caliper measurement,demonstrated $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs exhibiting enhanced antitumor activity over free DOX in terms of tumor growth suppression.

To further confirm the in vivo tumor inhibition effects, tumor nodules were dissected out at the end of drug treatment and histological HE staining and CD31 immunofluorescence staining were performed.For the HE staining,the cell nucleus was stained blue by hematoxylin,and the cytoplasmwas stained pink by eosin.The necrotic cells did not have a clear cell morphology and the nuclei became pyknotic or absent.The HE staining results showed that the tumor size and tumor cell number decreased in the DOX and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treatment groups compared to the control and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP groups. Moreover, there were more necrotic cells found inside tumors in $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX treatment compared to theDOX treatment, but not in the control and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP groups (Fig.10a-d).

The microvascular marker CD31 immunostaining results showed that CD31 expression decreased in the DOX and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treated tumors compared to the control and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP treated tumors (Fig.10e-h,arrows). In addition, there was more red fluorescence of DOX detected in the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEG-DOX NP group than in the free DOX treated tumors (Fig.1oi-l,arrows).The results indicated that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGnano carriers can facilitate the infltration of DOX in tumor regions, which can increase the antitumor and antiangiogenesis efficacy. The nuclei were stained using DAPI (Fig. $\mathsf { 1 0 m { - } p } )$ ,and the merged images of CD31,DOX and DAPI are also presented (Fig.10q-t).

Based on the above experiments,the data altogether manifested that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs possessed improved antitumor efficacy compared to the free DOx both in vivo and in vitro.One reason for the improved antitumor activity might be the enhanced accumulation of the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPs at the tumor site for the EPR effect.Moreover, the acidic tumor environment facilitating the release of DOX from NPs mayalso contribute to the therapeutic efficacy.

# 3.4Safety assessment of $\mathbf { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEGNPs invivo

It is well known that the chemotherapeutic effects of DOX may cause systemic adverse side effects in vivo,so we further examined the toxicity of free DOX and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEG-DOX NPS during the whole treatment period.The body weight loss is known to be an important indicator for evaluating drug-related toxicity.After 15 day drug treatment,the mice body weight changes were calculated and presented as body weightday15 bodyweight $\bf { d a y 0 }$ . The data showed that the mice body weight in the control and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP groups steadily increased,and the body weight changes were $1 3 . 1 \pm 1 . 4 2 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ and $1 2 . 9 3 \pm 0 . 3 9 \mathrm { \ g }$ （ respectively after 15 day treatment. DOX treatment caused a significant loss of body weight,and the body weight change was $- 2 . 5 \pm 2 . 0 6 \mathrm { \ g }$ 1 $^ { * * } P < 0 . 0 1 )$ (Fig. 11).As for the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NP treatment group,the mice body weight did not exhibit significant changes $( - 0 . 2 4 \pm 0 . 6 1 \mathrm { \ g } )$ ）duringthe15 day treatment period.The data indicated that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG nanocarriers wereable to decrease the toxicity ofDOXand reduce its systemic side effects in vivo.

We further examined the toxicity of the free DOX and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEG-DOXNP treatment to the major organs of the breast tumor bearing mice.The histological HE staining of the liver, kidney and heart was performed and we found hepatotoxicity in the DOX-treated group，but not in the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 } .$ -PEG-DOX NP treated group (Fig. 12a-d).In addition，the DOX treatment caused nephrotoxicity,whereas no obvious abnormalities were found in other treatment groups (Fig.12e-h). There were no abnormalities found in the heart in all treatment groups (Fig.12i-l).The results indicated that the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG nanocarrier canreduce the systemic toxicity of DOX to the major organs in vivo.

Moreover,the safety of the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGNP itselfasaninvivo drug delivery carrier is critical for further application,and was evaluated in our study.The early immunogenic response of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs was monitored by measuring the serum IFN- $a$ level,34 and the data showed that there was no statistical difference between $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP treated and saline treated mice (Fig.13). The data suggested that the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NP can be utilized as a safe drug carrier for in vivo application.

# 4． Conclusion

In summary,our study demonstrated that $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX nanoparticles,as safe drug carriers,increased the delivery of DOX to the tumor site and displayed enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo. The size of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX nanoparticles met the EPR effects of tumors with increased passive drug accumulation in the tumor region,and the nanoparticles possessed a stable hydrated diameter in serum.The in vitro cell viability experiment revealed an enhanced and prolonged inhibition of cell proliferation of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX nanoparticles compared with free DOX.With the aid of optical molecular imaging，the enhanced antitumor efficacy of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG-DOX NPswas dynamically and noninvasively examined byusing BLI on the orthotopic MDA-MB-231-GFP-fLuc breast tumor bearing nude mice.In addition, the improved anticancer efficacy was further validated through histology and CD31 immunostaining of tumor tissues.Furthermore,the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEG NPs were proved to be safe and biocompatible nanocarriers by testing the histology of major organs and the serum immunogenic IFN- $\alpha$ level. Overall, the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGNPs working as safe and biocompatible nanocarriers in vivo can enhance the antitumor efficacy and minimize the systemic adverse side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in vivo.Our work may provide an experimental basis for the potential clinical translation of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ -PEGNPsasan efficient and safe chemotherapeutic agent delivery platform.
