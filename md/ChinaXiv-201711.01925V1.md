Abstract Anew species of osteoglossid fish,Scleropages sinensis sp.nov.,is described from the Early Eocene Xiwanpu Formation in Hunan and the Yangxi Formation in Hubei, China.The new species was atributed to Scleropages,an extant genus of Osteoglossidae,because it very closely resembles the genus in skull bones,caudal skeleton,the shape and position of fins,and reticulate scales.The new fish is very similar to extant Scleropages except: the nasals do not appear to be ornamented; the sensory pore in the antorbital is large;the posterior infraorbitals are not quite covering the dorsal limb of the preopercle; the posteroventral angle of the preopercle is produced to point; the posteroventral margin of the opercle is concave and the ventral end of the bone is produced to a point; the pectoral fin is very long and extends well behind the beginning of the pelvic fin; the vertebral count is about 46-48; the parapophyses are shorter and the upper and lower caudal rays are nearly as long as the inner rays.The new fish is closer to its Asian neighbor, $S _ { \cdot }$ （20 formosus,than to its southern relative,S.leichardti.Scleropages formosus inhabits natural lakes, swamps,flooded forests,and slowly moving,deep parts of rivers with overhanging vegetative cover.It is a carnivorous fish and its food consists mainly of insects,fishes,worms,small amphibians,small mammals,and even birds.S.sinensis may live in the same natural environment and have a similar diet except for the largest items.Sexual dimorphism may exist in $S _ { \cdot }$ sinensis. The presumed male has a slimmer and shallower body,a relatively larger head,and a deeper mouth cleft. The discovery of Scleropages sinensis sp.nov. dates the divergence of Scleropages and Osteoglossum to no later than the Early Eocene

# 1 Introduction

Scleropages, an extant genus of Osteoglossidae, is a freshwater fish with a transoceanic distribution in Southeast Asia and Australia. It has four species, S. formosus (Müeller and

Schlegel, 1844) and S. inscriptus (Roberts, 2012) distributed in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand,and Cambodia, S. jardinii (Saville-Kent,1892) and S. leichardti (Günther,1864) in Australia and New Guinea.Pouyaud et al. (20o3) described three closely related new species of Scleropages by coloration, molecular data and morphometric characters, but these new species were questioned and regarded as synonyms of S. formosus by Kottelat and Widjanarti (2005) and Roberts (2012).Pouyaud et al. (2003) also designated a neotype for S. formosus in their redescription of this species.Martien et al. (2013) thought the designation to be unnecessary because the types are still extant.

The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus), known as the dragon fish, is one of the most prized and expensive aquarium fishes in the world. Some Asians believe that the arowana brings them good luck and fortune and even believe this fish can cast out evil spirits. This custom is still current in Thailand, China (Taiwan and Hong Kong),and Japan in spite of the fact that the fish was listed in the first appendix as in the highest class of protected fishes by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). At present, captive-bred dragon fish (F2 Generation) may be traded.

Fossil Scleropages are known from the Maastrichtian of India (Hora,1938;Rana,1988; Kumar et al.,20o5; Nolf et al.,2008), the Maastrichtian/Late Paleocene of Africa (Taverne,2009), the Paleocene of Europe (Taverne et al.,2O07), the Eocene of Sumatra (Sanders,l934; Forey and Hilton,2010), the Oligocene of Australia (Hils,1934,1943; Unmack,2001).All of these earlier records are scales,otoliths and isolated fragments of bones.Here we report the frst skeletons of fossil Scleropages from Lower Eocene strata in Xiangxiang, Hunan Province and Songzi, Hubei Province, China. Some specimens are complete and well preserved.A local farmer in Xiangxiang first collected the specimens and sent them to IVPP (Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences),and later, Li Chun from IVPP obtained a beautiful specimen (the holotype) from a farmer in Songzi. Zhang Miman of IVPP recognized these specimens first and then encouraged and advised the first author of this paper to study the specimens (including one piece from Xiangxiang sent by Song Changqi, a senior geologist), as she often helps young researchers to study the specimens in her care.Thereafter, the first author of this paper and his colleagues from IVPP collected tens of specimens of the fish along with other fishes during three field seasons, one in Xiangxiang and two in Songzi.

The specimens from Xiangxiang were found in gray-black shale of the lacustrine Xiawanpu Formation consisting predominantly of greenish, blue-gray claystone and grey-black shale, greyblack paper shale, with marlstone lenses.The geological age of the Xiawanpu Formation was considered to be Eocene or probably somewhat later (Liu et al.,1962; Cheng,1962),or Early Eocene to early Middle Eocene (ECSLC,1999).In addition to osteoglossds,some other fishes (Cheng,1962) including“Osteochilus” hunanensis (originally described as a cyprinid fish by Cheng (1962) and later revised to Amyzon hunanensis,a catostomid,by Chang et al. in 2001), Aoria (a genus of bagrid catfishes), Tungtingichthys (Perciformes),and Cyclurus (Amiidae, Chang et al.,201O),as well as ostracods,and plants were also found in the formation.

The Songzi specimens including the holotype were collected in the Yangxi Formation which is $1 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ in thickness and contacts conformably or disconformably with the underlying Paomagang Formation and the overlying Pailoukou Formation. The Yangxi Formation comprises shallow lacustrine deposits consisting of finely laminated mudstones and siltstones. Tons of slabs of fosil fishes (most are Jianghanichthys,a cypriniform fish) were unearthed by farmers and commercial collectors. Up to now, many vertebrate fossils have been found in this locality including the osteoglossid Phareodus songziensis (Zhang, 2003),Jianghanichthys (Liu et al.,2015),catfishes,perciforms,two rail-like birds Songzia heidangkouensis and S. acutunguis (Hou,199o; Wang et al.,2012),and a pantodont mammal Asiocoryphodon cf.A. conicus (Chen and Gao,1992). In addition, the oldest known primate was found in the same formation near this locality (Ni et al.,2O13). Other fossils seen in the locality are ostracods,gasteropods,charaphytes, spores and pollen. The age of the strata is EarlyEocene (ECSLC,1999).

# 2 Material andmethods

The specimens studied are deposited in the collection of Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), Chinese Academy of Sciences. The comparative materials of extant Scleropages (S. formosus, IVPP V OP 80; S. leichardti, IVPP V OP 81) were bought at a fish market in Beijing and are also deposited in the IVPP. Scleropages jardini and S.inscriptus were not found in Beijing fish market.

# 4 Description

The body of the fish is fusiform in adults,with median fins posteriorly positioned and pelvic fins in abdominal position. Skul bones are thick and squamation is heavy. The standard length of the largest specimen is $1 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ,that of the holotype is $1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and that of the smallest is $7 8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ . Unless otherwise indicated, the following description is based on the holotype (Fig.1),which is the best-preserved example.

Cranium The bone interpreted as the probable dermethmoid has an elongate, spearpoint shape, with a pointed anterior end and a long, tapered posterior end (Fig. 4). The nasals are large and suture in the midline along the anterior half of their length, but are separated by the tapered frontals posteriorly. The nasals are not noticeably ornamented,unlike the condition in extant Scleropages formosus (Taverne,1977:fig.73) and S. leichardti (IVPP dried skeleton). Also unlike the condition in the two extant species of Scleropages examined,the sensory canal appears to be exposed in a prominent groove in the fossil species.

The frontal is similar in shape and ornamentation to that of extant species of Scleropages (Taverne,1977:fig.73; IVPP dried skeleton of S. leichardti). It is long and subrectangular, with an anterior embayment for the reception of the nasal,and a posterior sinuous suture with its opposite member. In proportions it is slightly shorter and wider than that of S. leichardti and more like that of S. formosus.The lateral margin is embayed to conform to the medial margin of the dermosphenotic.Paralel to the lateral margin,the sensory canal is enclosed in bone for the middle third of its length,while being exposed in deep grooves for the anterior and posterior thirds of its length in the frontal.In S. leichardti and S.formosus,incontrast, the canal is enclosed in bone to or almost to its entry into the nasal.

As in other species of the genus,the parietal is subrectangular and sutures with its opposite at the midline and with the pterotic laterally.The surface of the anterior three-quarters of the bone is sculptured, while the posterior quarter lies at a lower level, beneath the canalbearing extrascapulars,and is not sculptured.Length-to-width proportions of the parietal are about 2:3,similar to those of S. formosus but unlike the 1:1 ratio seen in S. leichardti.

The external portion of the pterotic is a little larger and thicker than it is in extant species of Scleropages. The anterior half of the bone,lateral to the parietal, is sculptured and bears the temporal sensory canal in an open groove, whereas it is a simple tube in S. formosus (Taverne, 1977:fig. 73). The epiotic, supratemporal and supraoccipital are not visible in the available specimens.

Fig.2Scleropages sinensis sp.nov.,acomplete fish (IVPPV13672.3a) in right lateral view

Scleropages sinensis appears to have its extrascapular sensory commissure carried within tubular ‘extrascapulars' situated dorsal to the unsculptured area of the parietals, rather than passing directly through the parietals as seen in extant species of Scleropages (Taverne, 1977:fig.71). In both fossil and extant species,the canal is carried in paired extrascapular tubes between the previously mentioned bones and the posttemporals.

The orbital portion of the parasphenoid is toothless, moderately broad,and parallel-sided (V12749.5).The remainder is covered by infraorbitals in available specimens.

The circumorbital series (Fig. 4) is composed of six bones: an antorbital, four infraorbitals and a dermosphenotic.A supraorbital is absent.The antorbital, infraorbitals 1,3 and 4,and the dermosphenotic are all prominently sculptured, while infraorbital 2 is not preserved wel: enough for assessment of its sculpture.

![](images/db1843e51ca690b7c7878b2cdd31c1873130e9b4a80477ef9440c59934a6abf1.jpg)

The antorbital is polygonal, making contact with the dermopterotic posterodorsally, the frontal and parietal dorsomedially,and the first infraorbital ventrally.The concave anterior and orbital margins are free. The shape is similar to that of S. formosus (Taverne,1977:fig. 71). Dorsally the circumorbital sensory canal enters the antorbital via a short,broad groove, then passes through the bone in a tube, entering the first infraorbital where a large pore communicates with the exterior. In S. formosus as illustrated by Taverne (1977:fig.71), the later pore is small and the canal is completely enclosed in bone throughout its length.The antorbital in Osteoglossum bicirrhosum (Taverne,1977:fig.42) is more tubular and parallel-sided and unornamented; in S. leichardti (IVPP dried skeleton) it is also less polygonal but is ornamented.

The first and the second infraorbitals are narrow and tubular. The first is slightly expanded,longer,and more ornamented than the second, but the latter is not well preserved.

Fig.4Scleropages sinensis sp. nov., skull as preserved in holotype,left lateral view Abbreviations:an.angular;ant.antorbital; br. branchiostegals; de.dermethmoid; den.dentary; dsph.dermosphenoid; enp.endopterygoid; fr.frontal; hm.hyomandibula;iol-4.first to fourth infraorbitals; mx. maxilla; na. nasal; op.opercle; pa. parietal; pas. parasphenoid; pmx. premaxilla; pop. preopercle; pto.pterotic; ptt. posttemporal; qu. quadrate; rar. retroarticular; scl. supracleithrum

The two posterior infraorbitals (third and fourth) are very large but do not quite reach the size of those in extant Scleropages and Osteoglossum,in which they extend posteriorly to the articulation of the opercle,completely concealing the dorsal end of the preopercle and covering the posterior suspensorium. In S. sinensis there is a narrow gap through which the dorsal limb of the preopercle may be seen.The two posterior infraorbitals have a ratio of width to height of about 0.75, compared to about 1.0-1.2 in the two extant species of Scleropages. The two bones are nearly equal in size,like those in extant Scleropages but differing from those in Osteoglossum,in which the lower one is much larger than the upper. The infraorbital sensory canal is carried in a tube near the orbital margin of both posterior infraorbitals,with only a single small pore opening externally near the anteroventral end of the third infraorbital, as in the specimen of S. formosus figured by Taverne (1977:fig.71).In O. bicirrhosum the pore is much larger and directed posteroventrally into a large groove (Taverne,1977:fig. 42).

The complete or near-complete enclosure by infraorbitals of the cheek posteroventral to the orbit is considered to be a synapomorphy of Osteoglossidae by Li and Wilson (1996) and Hilton (2003). Among early osteoglossomorphs,this character is found only in Paralycoptera. Accordingly, Paralycoptera was considered to be closely related to or included within Osteoglossidae by different authors (Chang and Chou,1977; Ma and Sun,1988; Jin et al., 1995; Zhang, 2002).

The dermosphenotic is large, thick, sculptured,and approximately triangular. It bears the infraorbital canal internally near its posterior margin. The canal emerges from the posterodorsal corner of the dermosphenotic,where it enters the frontal to join with the supraorbital sensory canal near the anterior end of the posterior sensory groove of the frontal. In S. formosus the canal also joins within the frontal, but within a bone-enclosed tube.In V12749.5 there is a suggestion of a branch in the infraorbital canal within the dermosphenotic,but the course of this branch cannotbe detailed. Taverne (1977:fig.71) did not show any branching within the dermosphenotic.

JawsThe premaxilla is small, approximately triangular, and sculptured. It bears a blunt ascending process in its anterior half. There are seven teeth on the left premaxilla of the holotype, the anterior three teth being much larger than the posterior ones.The number of teeth on the premaxilla of extant Scleropages has been counted differently, 4-5 by Ridewood (1905),3-5 by Kershaw (1976),and 11 by Taverne (1977). In the four specimens of extant Scleropages that we examined, this numberis 6-8,a condition agreeing with that of S. sinensis.

The maxilla is long and slender,and takes an angle of about $4 5 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } }$ with the long axis of the fish when the mouth is closed. It extends posteriorly nearly to the level of the mandibular articulation and ends wellbehind the posterior margin of the orbit.The posterior end is slightly expanded and downturned, especially immediately posterior to the marginal teeth. Ornament is present all along the external surface but is most prominent at the anterior and posterior ends. As in all living osteoglossomorphs, there is no supramaxilla.

The maxilla bears 40 conical teeth in an external row in the holotype,a resemblance in number with S.formosus and a difference from S.leichardti,in which the teeth number about 35 (IVPP dried skeletons). The teeth decrease in size steadily from anterior to posterior. Here and there,a few smaller teeth seen behind and between these marginal teeth might represent replacement teeth.

The mandible is also very long,makes a $4 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } }$ angle with the long axis of the fish, lacks a distinct coronoid process,and consists of three bones: dentary,angulo-articular, and retroarticular. The dentary forms the great majority $( 3 / 4 )$ of the length of the mandible. Anteriorly, the dentary curves medially to meet its opposite at a shallow symphysis.As for the premaxilla, the anterior five or six teeth of the dentary are much larger than the posterior ones.

As in extant Scleropages (Taverne,1977:fig. 71),the angulo-articular is relatively small, articulates with the quadrate as seen in lateral view,and the posterior tip of the retroarticular is visible laterally posterior to the quadrate articulation.Both dentary and angulo-articular bear longitudinal ridges on their lateral surfaces.

The mandibular sensory canal extends the length of the dentary and angulo-articular within a canal, with one pore located near the ventral end of the suture between the anguloarticular and dentary,as in S. formosus (Taverne,1977:fig. 71) and three more pores evenly spaced and opening onto posteriorly directed grooves more anteriorly in the dentary, as in $S .$ （2 formosus and S. leichardti (IVPP dried skeletons).

Palato-quadrate arch The toothed palato-ectopterygoids are preserved in V 12749.5, in which both have a row of uniform-sized small teeth on their lateral margins. On the right one can be seen more medially an area of much smaller teeth. Both conditions are matched in extant S. formosus (Taverne,1977:fig. 83) and S. leichardti (IVPP dried skeleton). According to Taverne (1977:134-135), the anterior end of this bone in S. formosus includes the fused dermopalatine,with the autopalatine ossified only in the largest,oldest individuals.We were unable to confirm these details in S. sinensis.

The entopterygoid in extant species of Scleropages is triangular, a single row of large conical teeth existing on the medial edge,and fine denticles covering the remainder of the surface.The detailed shape is not seen in the fossls of S.sinensis,but part of the medial row of large teeth on the right entopterygoid is visible in the holotype.These teeth are larger posteriorly than anteriorly,and each is curved slightly ventrolaterally, as in S. leichardti (IVPP dried skeleton).In V12750 the medial row and more lateral denticles are visible in cross section.The metapterygoid, symplectic,and most of the quadrate are covered by the posterior infraorbitals in available specimens,although the quadrate and symplectic are exposed in inner view in V12750.

Hyoid arch and branchiostegalsOnly a very small part of the hyomandibular can be seen in the holotype. The tip of a bone protruding from beneath the anterior margin of the fourth infraorbital in the holotype might be the entopterygoid process of the hyomandibular as characteristically seen in extant osteoglossids,but it seems rather too stout. On the other hand, it is not oriented appropriately to be identified with the basipterygoid process of the parasphenoid, which might be expected to occur in the same area of the fossil.

A small triangular hypohyal, most of the anterior ceratohyal and basihyal are seen in V 12749.5.There are 9 slender,acinaciform branchiostegal rays in the holotype,and at least two broad, spatulate ones. In S. formosus,Taverne (1977:fig. 84) illustrates 9 acinaciform and 7 spatulate branchiostegals; thus we might estimate that S. sinensis had a similar number, perhaps 16 in total, given that only two spatulate branchiostegals are preserved.

Opercular seriesThe preopercle is similar but not identical to that in the extant species of Scleropages. The upper limb is not completely covered by posterior infraorbitals as it is in the extant species of the genus (Taverne,l977:fig.71). The dorsal limb tapers uniformly dorsally, as far as can be seen,and is about twice as long as the ventral limb.The latter is bluntly rounded anteroventrally. The posteroventral angle of the preopercle is produced posteriorly to a point,located immediately below the ventral extremity of the opercle. This last feature is not seen in the preopercles of extant species of Scleropages but is met with in a more extreme form in some African osteoglossiforms such as Chauliopareion Murray and Wilson,

2005,and Singida as redescribed by Murray and Wilson (2005).

The preopercular sensory canal in S. sinensis has features typical for osteoglossids. The canal is open ventrally beneath a long,horizontal shelf. On the shelf,and dorsal to it, the preopercle is sculptured, but ventral to it the surface of the preopercle is smooth.From the posterior end of this shelf to the dorsal end of the vertical limb,the preopercular canal is enclosed in bone beneath the anterior edge of the exposed portion of the bone,except for a single,large pore at about half the height of the preopercle. This pore opens posteriorly from the main canal into a prominent groove directed posteroventrally.

In other osteoglossids the relative height of this single pore varies,but essentially the same feature is seen, where preservation permits,in many genera of Osteoglossidae and Notopteridae including extant species of Scleropages and fossil taxa such as Phareodus and Musperia (e.g., Taverne,1977,1978). Arapaima and Heterotis do not exhibit the shelf and single large pore, showing instead a bone-enclosed canal opening via pores,while the condition in Pantodon is perhaps somewhat intermediate (Taverne,1978).

The opercle in S. sinensis is large and nearly semicircular in shape,but differs from that in the extant species of Scleropages and Osteoglossum in having its ventral end produced to a point and its posteroventral margin concave. The opercle is also prominently sculptured except for its anterior margin and dorsal extremity.The opercle in the holotype has a height of $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and a maximum width,at right angles to the anterior edge, of $1 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ .The hyomandibular facet is located at a height of $1 9 \mathrm { m m }$ from the ventral end, judging by the arrangement of ornamental ridges on the external surface.The subopercle and the interopercle are not visible.

Appendicular skeletonThe pectoral girdle is partially seen in the holotype and in V 12749.8.The posttemporal is a forked bone with the dorsal limb longer than the ventral one. The lateral line runs near the ventral margin of the bone and probably goes into the trunk scales directly, without passing through the supracleithrum,as in the living osteoglossids.

The supracleithrum is strap-like dorsally and broadens ventrally; it is recurved rather than following a uniform curve as seen in extant species of Scleropages. In Osteoglossum the bone broadens ventrally but is not recurved (Taverne,1977).A small postcleithrum is present and lies medial to the junction between the supracleithrum and cleithrum.

The cleithrum is best exposed in specimen V 12749.8, in which it is seen to have a long dorsal limb of uniform width,terminating dorsally in a long,rod-like process. In contrast, the cleithrum of extant species of Scleropages (Taverne,1977:fig. 86; IVPP dried skeletons) has only a smaller, acuminate dorsal extremity, much shorter and more slender than that of $S$ sinensis.The coracoid, scapula,and mesocoracoid have not been seen.

Four proximal pectoral radials that support the pectoral rays except for the first ray can be recognized in the holotype, with the first thick and stout and the others becoming small posteriorly

The pectoral fin (Figs. 1,3C) is very long and extends well behind the beginning of the pelvic fin, a difference from the extant species of Scleropages where it does not reach the beginning of the pelvic fin. In the holotype the longest rays are $4 7 \mathrm { m m }$ long,whereas the pelvic fin originates $3 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ posterior to the origin of the pectoral fin.

The pectoral fin contains seven rays, resembling that of S. formosus rather than $S$ 号 leichardti where the fin has eight rays (IVPP dried skeletons); all rays are branched and segmented except the first one which is exceptionally thick and unbranched, though segmented. Adjacent to the base of the smallest ray there is a claw-shaped bone.

The pelvic girdle and fin are very small. The pelvic fn originates slightly closer to the anal fin than to pectoral fin. The pelvic bone (seen in V 12749.8) is short and flat. There appear to be six pelvic fin rays,all branched but the first, a condition agreeing with that of $S .$ leichardti and differing from S.formosus which has five fin rays in specimens examined.

Dorsal and anal finsBoth dorsal and anal fins are rounded in outline and located posteriorly. The dorsal fin is smalland originates posterior to the origin of anal fin,opposite the middle of the anal fin. In the holotype there are two short procurrent dorsal rays,the second one segmented, followed by one full-length unbranched ray,and 11 branched rays, the last one apparently double, for a total of 12 principal rays. Fourteen short dorsal pterygiophores can be counted,matching the fin rays one-to-one. Other specimens (V 12749.1,2) may have slightly more principal rays,12-15 in available specimens,with 14-17 pterygiophores.

The anal fin is much larger than the dorsal fin, with three very small, unsegmented procurrent rays and 22 principal rays, supported by 23 anal pterygiophores in the holotype, and 21-24 anal pterygiophores in other specimens (V 12749.1,4). This resembles the condition in $S .$ （20号 formosus and differs from that in S. leichardti, in which 28 principle fin rays are present.

Vertebral column and caudal fin There are 46-48 vertebrae in available specimens, of which in the holotype about 22 are abdominals and 24 are caudals including the two ural centra.This number is much less than in extant osteoglossids and agrees more with that of early osteoglossomorphs such as Kuntulunia and Xixiaichthys (Zhang,1998, 2004). The first three centra are covered by the opercle. The centra are slightly deeper than long.

The first four neural spines are paired and the remainder anterior to the dorsal fin are fused into a single element. In extant Scleropages and Osteoglossum,this condition varies, neural spines being fused beginning with the third in S.formosus and with the eighth in O. bicirrhosum (e.g.,Taverne,1977:108,147). Parapophyses are difficult to see but appear (V 12749.8) to be much shorter than in extant Scleropages,Osteoglossum,and Phareodus (Li et al.,1997) and even shorter than in most early osteoglossomorphs (Zhang and Jin,1999; Zhang,1998,2004).

There are 22 pairs of pleural ribs, which extend to the ventral margin of the trunk, except for the last pair,which is only about half the length of the more anterior ones.

Long, slender epineurals are present, their proximal ends not fused with the neural arches. The last epineural is related to the second vertebra following the last abdominal vertebra.

Some 22 long, slender supraneurals are seen in specimen V 12749.8,anterior to the dorsal fin and lying at a shallow angle to the long axis of the body so that each one overlaps the dorsal end of one or two neural spines.

The caudal skeleton (Figs.3D,5) is very similar to that of the extant species of

Scleropages with a couple of exceptions. Unfortunately, these details can only be seen in a single specimen of S. sinensis (V 12749.8). The caudal skeletons in the two examined extant species of Scleropages (Fig. 6) display important differences, each resembling that of $S$ sinensis in some ways but not in others.

Three neural and haemal spines in S. sinensis are lengthened to support the caudal fin rays; these haemal spines gradually thicken posteriorly. The first preural centrum bears a complete neural spine, while in some specimens of S. leichardti the centrum bears two.

The first ural centrum (U1) appears to have two incompletely fused neural spines,with the first complete and the second one shorter. The second ural centrum (U2) is fused with the proximal ends of hypurals 3-5. There are six hypurals. Hypural 1 is very deep and does not reach U1 proximally.Hypural 2 is less than half the width of the first and either articulates with or is fused to the centrum as in extant species of Scleropages. Hypurals 3 through 5 are fused proximally and fit tightly together distally.A rod-like bone dorsal to hypurals 3-5 is probably the sixth hypural. Just above this bone,a similarly shaped bone is interpreted here as fused uroneurals (see Hilton,2oo3,for discussion of this unusual feature of osteoglossiforms).

In S. leichardti, centrum U1 supports three hypurals in every specimen available to us, a very unusual situation for a teleostean fish. The first two of these hypurals are fused to each other proximally but separated distally,and the combined first two hypurals do not reach U1. In contrast, both S. formosus and $O$ 、bicirrhosum have the more usual situation of two lower hypurals, the first not reaching U1 and the second joins it.

The greatly enlarged first hypural in S. sinensis seems deep enough to correspond to the two partially fused hypurals of extant S. leichardti specimens.This hypural is as deep as the first two (of three lower) hypurals in S. leichardti.However, we do not see any evidence of a division into two hypurals in this specimen. The occurrence in S. sinensis of two incompletely separated neural spines on U1 might suggest an origin by fusion of centra. However, the neural spine of S. leichardti specimens examined by us is not doubled, whereas they have an extra lower hypural. Additional specimens showing the caudal skeleton of S. sinensis and a study of the development of the caudal skeleton in S. leichardti could be very informative in light of these findings.

Fig.7Scleropages sinensis sp.nov.,scales,IVPPV13672.3a

The caudal fin is rounded. There are l6 principal caudal rays,the first and the last being unbranched and almost as long as the remaining rays,whereas in living species of Scleropages and Osteoglossum, the upper and lower rays are only half the length of the innermost ones.One or two procurrent rays are present anterior to the principal rays.

Squamation The scales are

large (Figs.2,7),cycloid, oval,and exhibit the reticulate pattern, involving small units called squamules, typical of osteoglossids (Fig. 8). The external surface of the scale shows circuli in the basal portion and granular ornamentation in the apical area. The squamules (Gayet and Meunier,1983) are rhombic, polygonal, or irregular in shape. The mesial surface of each squamule may be smooth or bear 1-25 rounded,raised tubercles,each of which has a minute transversal-pore (Jolly and Bajpai, 1988) at its center.

The lateral line (Fig.2) runs just below the vertebral column and the scales along the lateral line number about 24,a similar number to that in S. formosus and 10 scales fewer than is seen in S. leichardti (IVPP specimens).

# 5 Discussion

The new fish found in Hubei and Hunan provinces of China very much resembles Scleropages in skull bones,caudal skeleton, the shape and position of fins,and reticulate scales (Fig. 9). Therefore, it must belong to the genus. Scleropages has four species, two in Australia and New Guinea (S. jardinii and S. leichardti) and the other two in Asia (S. formosus and S.inscriptus). S. jardinii and S. leichardti are very similar to each other, while S. formosus and S. inscriptus are nearly identical except the latter has complex maze-like markings on circumorbitals,opercular series and scales.For this reason and because specimens of the other two species were not available to us, only S. leichardti and S. formosus were used as representatives of extant Scleropages for comparison study.

The new fish is very similar to S. leichardti and S. formosus,except: the nasals do not appear to be ornamented; the sensory canal is exposed in prominent groove on the nasals (unless a preservational artifact); the supraorbital sensory canal is enclosed in bone on the frontal only for middle third of its length; unornamented posterior portion of the parietal is only 1/4 of its length rather than $2 / 3$ ; the commissure is in extrascapular tubes rather than passing through the parietals; the pterotic is thicker in its lateral portion; the sensory pore in the antorbital is larger than in the extant species; the two posterior infraorbitals are not as large as in extant species of Scleropages, not quite covering the dorsal limb of the preopercle,and their width to height ratio is about O.75 rather than 1-1.2; the posteroventral angle of the preopercle is produced to a point, unlike the condition in the extant species; the posteroventral margin of opercle is concave and the ventral end of the bone is produced to a point (in the extant species the ventral end of the opercle is not as produced and the posteroventral margin is not concave); the supracleithrum is recurved Vs uniformly curved; the dorsal process of the cleithrum is long, strong, and rod-shaped vs shorter and acuminate in the extant species; the pectoral fin is very long and extends well behind the beginning of the pelvic fin; vertebrae number about 46-48 vs ${ \sim } 6 0$ in extant species and other Recent osteoglossids; the parapophyses are shorter; the neural spine on U1 is partly doubled; the upper and lower caudal rays are nearly as long as the inner rays (vs much shorter).Based on these differences,a new species is established, Scleropages sinensis sp. nov.

Scleropages sinensis is similar to S. formosus but different from S. leichardti in that: proportions of length to width of parietal are 2:3 vs 1:1; the antorbital proportions are similar to those in S. formosus but in S. leichardti the antorbital is not as polygonal; maxillary teeth number about 40 vs about 35 in S. leichardti; principal anal rays are 21-24 vs 28 in S. leichardti; there are two lower hypurals vs three in S. leichardti; there are 24 scales along the lateral line, vs ${ \sim } 3 4$ inS.leichardti.

Scleropages sinensis also shares some similarities with S.leichardti but differs from S. formosus. These characters include six pelvic rays vs five in S. formosus,the first hypural very deep (as deep as the first two in S. leichardti,and unlike the slender first hypural in $S .$ formosus).Pelvic fin rays are seven in Hiodontidae, six principle plus one short in Kuntulunia and Xixiaichthys,six in Lycoptera and Asiatolepis (Zhang,2010: five in original description, but clearly six in V 11982.28a). Therefore,having more pelvic rays is likely to be a primitive condition in osteoglossomorphs. Centrum U1 supporting three hypurals in S. leichardti is a very unusual situation in teleosts. The same condition was noticed by Hilton (2003） in $S _ { \mathbf { \alpha } }$ jardinii ( $1 5 2 { \mathrm { ~ m m ~ S L } }$ ）andby $\mathrm { { X u } }$ and Chang (2oo9) in S. jardinii and S. leichardti.Hilton thought that study of more specimens was needed to confirm if this is due to ontogeny (i.e., if hypural 1 typically is composed of two elements) or is an individual variation. Although the first hypural in S. sinensis seems deep enough to correspond to the first two hypurals in S. leichardti, no evidence of a possble division into two hypurals can be seen. The caudal skeleton is usually covered by scales in S. sinensis that make it difficult to know if there is any variation in the hypural pattern.

Fig.9Comparison between Scleropages sinensis sp.nov.(A,IVPPV 12749.1) and S.formosus (B,IVPPVOP 8O),S. leichardti (C,VOP 81)

According to the above comparison between S. sinensis sp. nov. and the extant Scleropages,it is clear that the new fish is closer to its Asian neighbor, S. formosus than to its southern relative,S.leichardti.

The Asian arowana S. formosus is distributed in the Mekong Basin in Viet Nam and Cambodia, southeastern Thailand, Tenassarim (Myanmar), the Malay Peninsula from Sungai Golok southwards,Borneo,and Sumatra.It inhabits natural lakes, swamps, flooded forests, and slowly moving, deep parts of rivers with overhanging vegetative cover. The Asian arowana is a carnivorous fish and its food consists mainly of insects, fishes,worms, small amphibians, small mammals,and even birds. It can jump very high in the wild to get food hanging on trees. S. sinensis may have lived in the same natural environment and could have had a similar diet except for the largest items considering the smaller body size of the new fish.

Arowana are paternal mouthbrooders. The Asian arowana is not easy to sex. Scott and Fuller (1976) found no obvious external sexual differences in 170 specimens (32 were fry) they obtained in Malaya.But Suleiman (2Oo3) argued that the differences become apparent after maturity is reached at about 3-4 years of age. The determination of sex is based on the body shape and the size of the mouth cavity. Males have a slimmer and shallower body depth (while females have a more rounded body),a bigger mouth and more intense color than the females. A larger mouth and a deeper lower jaw in males are beneficial for holding more eggs and fry. These sexual differences can also be seen in S.sinensis.The holotype (Fig.1) and another fish (Fig.3A) have a slimmer and shallower body,a relatively larger head and a deeper mouth cleft. In contrast, some other individuals (Fig.2) have a more rounded body and a smaller head. This suggests a possible sexual dimorphism in S. sinensis. The deeper mouth cleft in the holotype and V 12749.4 (Fig. 3A) also suggests the possibility of paternal mouthbrooding in S. sinensis. Unfortunately, no direct evidences such as eggs and fry can be found on the fossils.

Except for Hiodon,which lives only in North America,all the other extant osteoglossomorphs are distributed in the tropical or subtropical fresh waters of southern continents.Fossil osteoglossomorphs were found from fresh water deposits (some forms, such as Brychaetus, may live in brackish water and even marine) in all the continents except Antarctica.The explanation for such a transoceanic distribution of freshwater fishes is a challenge for paleogeography and historical biogeography. Nelson (1969) argued that Africa was probably the center of the ancestral distribution of osteoglossomorphs. Greenwood (1970) and Chang and Chou (1976) supposed that East Asia might be the ancestral of osteoglossomorphs. Gayet (1987) explained the present distribution of osteoglossomorphs by a hypothetical “lost Pacifica".Al these hypotheses failed to resolve the transoceanic distribution of the superorder Osteoglossomorpha satisfactorily.Li (1997) and $\mathrm { { X u } }$ and Chang (2009),in contrast, suggested that the early evolution of Osteoglossomorpha occurred in Pangea.

The earliest fossil record of Osteoglossomorpha is Lycoptera (Barremian) (Swisher et al., 2002).Early osteoglossomorphs have mostly been recovered from China, but have also been found in other parts of the world, such as Chandlerichthys from North America (Cenomanian), Laeliichthys from South America (Aptian), Kipalaichthys from Africa (Cenomanian). Since Osteoglossomorpha were already widely distributed on both northern and southern continents in the Early and mid-Cretaceous,it is reasonable to suggest that the superorder originated in Pangea.

Li (1997) believed that the earliest member of the main lineages of Osteoglossomorpha had already extended their distribution to most parts of Pangea before its final break up and the recent relict distribution of the superorder resulted from extinction.Li conceived that the transoceanic dispersal and vicariance of Osteoglossomorpha did not happen after the final split of Pangea. Phareodus,a very common genus of fossil osteoglossid also seen in the same formation with S. sinensis,has been found in Pakistan, India, Sumatra (Musperia),North America and Australia.If transmarine migration never happened, a Pangea origin would be the most likely model to interpret the transoceanic distribution of Phareodus. Based on their study on molecular phylogeny of osteoglossoids, Kumazawa and Nishida (2oo0) concluded that the divergence time between Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) and Australia arowana (S. leichardti and S. jardinii) is about l38 million years,which is close to or slightly older than the probable time of the India-Madagascan separation from Gondwanaland (120-130 Ma, Smith et al., 1994). They consequently argued that the Asian arowana originated on a part of Gondwanaland and was carried to Eurasia by the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, the transoceanic migration of Osteoglossomorpha might have occurred after the split of Pangea.

The Eocene collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia has been accepted for a long time (Besse et al.,1984; Metcalfe,1999), but recent data support the view that terrestrial continuity between India and mainland Asia was already established by the time of the $\mathrm { \ K / }$ T boundary, $6 5 ~ \mathrm { { M a } }$ ago,or probably slightly earlier (Beck et al., 1995; Jaeger et al.,1989; Prasad et al., 1994; Rage et al., 1995). The discovery of Scleropages and Phareodus from mainland Asia suggests the possibility that the genus originated in Gondwana and dispersed to Asia through the Indian subcontinent, and then Phareodus to North America via the Bering Strait.The Eocene fish fauna along the coast of the Bohai Gulf, eastern China, shows striking similarity in composition to those of the same age along the west coast of North America, demonstrating a “transpacific” distributional pattern (Chang and Chen, 2Oo0). The Arctic connection of the northern continents and the broad connection between Asia and North America in the Bering Strait area may have served as a passage for the fishes from both sides of the Pacific (Chang and Chen,20oo). With those connections between the two places, Phareodus could have dispersed from Asia to North America. Scleropages has been found in the Maastrichtian, Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene and Phareodus was cosmopolitan in the Eocene, but their Late Cretaceous representatives were only found in southern continents.The fossil records thus seem to support the view of a Gondwanian origin of osteoglossids.

However, a recent work (Lavoué, 2015) rejected the Gondwanian origin of Scleropages. Lavoué reported an age CI of Scleropages ranging from 79.9 to $1 0 1 . 4 ~ \mathrm { M a }$ ，which is significantly younger than the（ $( 1 3 8 \pm 1 8 )$ Ma age inferred by Kumazawa and Nishida (2000). Recent paleogeographical reconstructions (Gibbons et al., 2013; Scotese,2014) give a latest possible age ( $\mathrm { 1 1 5 . 0 ~ M a } ,$ ）for a direct connection of the Indian subcontinent to AustraliaAntarctica. Lavoue's result suggests that the divergence between the Sundaland-Indochina Scleropages and the Australia-New Guinea Scleropages is younger than $1 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { M a }$ .Theearly divergence of Scleropages therefore occurred after the final separation between India and Antarctica-Australia. Consequently, his study rejects the Gondwanian origin hypothesis to explain the distribution of Scleropages.

More recently, Lavoué (2016) used newly reconstructed time-calibrated phylogenetic trees based on a large dataset combining extant and fossil taxa and molecular and morphological characters to test whether the divergence of Osteoglossformes was compatible with the breakup of Gondwana.He thought that the most convincing evidence that some osteoglossomorphs may have achieved their current transmarine distribution through marine dispersal is from the genus Scleropages.Marine dispersal in Scleropages was also mentioned by Cracraft (1974), Briggs (1979) and Wilson and Murray (2008). Taverne et al. (2007) argued that Recent freshwater Osteoglossiformes generally tolerate brackish waters and sometimes enter in marine waters near the estuaries.In contrast, Lavoué (2O15） suggested that Scleropages species are highly intolerant of salt water according to the investigations of Gehrke et al. (2011) and Roberts (1978).

The distribution of osteoglossids remains a zoogeographical enigma. Marine fossils of Scleropages or an unknown vicariance event are wanted to explain the intercontinental distribution of the genus. In such a situation, the discovery of Scleropages sinensis dates the divergence of Scleropages and Osteoglossum as at least old as the Early Eocene, which is a significant step toward solving this zoogeographical puzzle.

摘要：金龙鱼化石的鳞片和骨骼碎片在过去时有报道，但鉴定并非十分可靠，因为在骨舌鱼科鱼类中这些鳞片和骨骼十分相似。首次记述了保存完美的金龙鱼化石，标本产于湖南湘乡下湾铺组和湖北松滋洋溪组，确立为骨舌鱼科金龙鱼属一新种：中华金龙鱼Scleropages sinensis sp.nov.。新种与现生金龙鱼(Scleropages)在头部骨骼、尾骨骼、各鳍的形状和位置以及具有网状鳞片等方面极为相似，因而归入该属。然而，新种在以下特征上不同于金龙鱼的现生种：鼻骨无纹饰，鼻骨上的感觉管显露于沟内，感觉管联合不经过顶骨，翼耳骨侧向加厚，眶前骨上的感觉孔大，眼眶后的眶下骨不完全覆盖前鳃盖骨上支，其宽高比例为0.75而非现生种的1-1.2，前鳃盖骨后下角变尖，鳃盖骨后下缘凹形、下端变尖，匙骨背突长大，脊椎46-48,椎体横突短小，胸鳍十分长大，上下两端的尾鳍条和内部鳍条等长。亚洲的现生种发现于各种河流和小溪中，比较喜欢水草茂盛的静水环境，一般游弋于表层水中，以鱼虾、昆虫等为食，新种中华金龙鱼也应该有相似的生长环境和食性。新种似具有性二形性，雄鱼体形略纤细，头部略大，口裂更深。中华金龙鱼化石的发现，说明金龙鱼属(Scleropages)和骨舌鱼属(Osteoglossum)在早始新世以前就已经分化，这对解释骨舌鱼类的跨洋分布具有十分重要的意义。

Abstract The Guodikeng Formation encompasses the terrestrial Permo-Triassic transition sequence in China.This formation crops out in the Dalongkou section, Jimsar,Xinjiang where remains of the dicynodonts Jimusaria and Lystrosaurus were found. We are describing here a therocephalian and a chroniosuchian from the Dalongkou section,which are the first records of these groups for the Guodikeng Formation.Diagnostic characters of the new therocephalian, Dalongkoua fuae gen. and sp.nov., include maxillary ventral margin strongly concave in lateral view;incisors spatulated and rounded;incisors and canines with faint serrations; coronoid process of the dentary with a marked external adductor fossa; triangular reflected lamina of the angular with two smooth concavities.Chroniosuchians are represented by several postcranial elements and the vertebral morphology is similar to Bystrowiana and Bystrowiella.These remains are interpreted as representing a Bystrowianidae indeterminate.The new findings increase the diversity of the Guodikeng Formation that is now represented by three or four dicynodonts,one therocephalian and one chroniosuchian.All these groups survived the massive P-T extinction but disappear from the fossil record in the Middle to Upper Triassic.

# 1 Introduction

Dalongkou section, Jimsar, in Xinjiang is a famous terrestrial section with PermoTriassic transitional sequences. The southern limb Dalongkou anticline section (SLS) has been suggested as a candidate for the global non-marine Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) reference section (Cheng and Lucas,1993,Liu,1994). This section was originally known by its fossil vertebrate bearings. This formation produced the dicynodonts Jimusaria sinkianensis and the first specimen of Lystrosaurus from China (Sun, 1963; Yuan and Young,1934a,b), later the co-occurrence of these taxa on the same horizon of the Dalongkou section were noticed (Cheng,1993).The lowest occurrence of Lystrosaurus at the SLS is at the base of bed 63 or 54 of the measured lithostratigraphic section (Fig. 1), ${ \sim } 6 5 \mathrm { ~ m }$ below the base of the Jiucaiyuan Formation (Cheng,1993; Liu et al.,2002). The exact position of the holotype of Jimusaria sinkianensis is unknown, but Cheng (in Yang et al., 1986) suggested it could lies within the top $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m }$ of the Guodikeng Formation. This is perhaps the reason why Kozur and Weems (2011) located the stratigraphic position of this dicynodont $1 5 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ below the base of the Jiucaiyuan Formation. Besides dicynodonts, the procolophonid Santaisaurus yuani and the archosauriform Chasmatosaurus yuani were discovered from horizons of the Jiucaiyuan Formation at the Dalongkou section (Koh,1940; Li et al., 2008;Young,1958,1963).

The PTB in the Junggar Basin was traditionally positioned at the base of the Jiucaiyuan Formation, but a joint team of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and the Xinjiang Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources first proposed the PTB within the Guodikeng Formation (Yang et al., 1986). They tentatively located the PTB at the uppermost Guodikeng Formation; one major reason for this decision was the position of the lowest occurrence of Lystrosaurus.For a long time,Lystrosaurus was a Triassic index fossil,and its lowest occurrence marked (or at least approximate) the base of the Triassic (cf.Lucas,1998).

Based on palynomorph evidence, Ouyang and Norris (1999) placed the PTB at the base ofUnit 3 in the uppermost Guodikeng Formation, $\sim 5 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ below the base of the Jiucaiyuan Formation. Hou (20o4) discovered overlapping interval of sporomorphs from the middle part of the Guodikeng Formation at SLS,and placed the PTB at the base of $\operatorname { B e d } 5 1$ of the measured lithostratigraphic section 1 (Fig.1). Furthermore,Pang and Jin (2004) observed a distinct turnover in the ostracod assemblages between Bed 54 and 55 in the Guodikeng Formation (Fig.1),approximately $1 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ above the PTB suggested by the palynological analysis of Hou (2004).Foster and Afonin (2oo5) studied the abnormal pollen grains from Russia and China, and suggested that the latest Permian mass extinction level lies at the upper lower Guodikeng Formation,between Bed 63 to 65 on s1. Using conchostracan biostratigraphy, Kozur and Weems (2O11） proposed the continental extinction event horizon at the middle part of the Guodikeng Formation at SLS;and they proposed that the first appearance datum (FAD) of Falsisca verchojanica, ${ \sim } 2 5 \mathrm { m }$ below the base of the Jiucaiyuan Formation at SLS,correlates to the PTB.Based on the paleomagnetic data,Li et al. (2O03) put the PTB between their Bed 41 and 42 at the SLS. Cao et al. (2008) suggested an isotopically defined PTB at the base of Bed 65 (Fig. 1).

In summary, there are distinct faunal and floral turnovers in the middle part of the Guodikeng Formation.As suggested by Kozur and Weems (2011), their relationships with the end-Permian mass extinction need to be studied carefully, but they must not equate to the PTB.

A recent revision of Dicynodon restricted the name to two species from the African

Permian and Jimusauria, that was synonymized to Dicynodon,is considered as a valid taxon different of Dicynodon (Kammerer et al., 2011). The phylogeny presented by Kammerer et al. (2011:fig. 156) found Jimusauria as a basal form in a clade of Permian and Triassic dicynodonts.Metcalfe et al. (20o9) points out the poor record of Lystrosaurus in the Guodikeng Formation in opposition to the rich representation of this taxon in the overlying Jiucaiyuan Formation. Considering the faunal composition of the Permo-Triassic transition in South Africa, they argue that the combined presence of Lystrosaurus and the Jimusauria is more likely representing levels of the Late Permian,in which the former taxon is poorly represented (Smith and Botha-Brink,2014).As a result the PTB is interpreted on the top of the Guodikeng Formation, near the base of the Jiucaiyuan Formation.Recently, Gastaldo et al.(2015) reported a dicynodontoid skull of characteristically Permian aspect more than 10 m above the previous last occurrence of Dicynodon and a zircon age of ( $( 2 5 3 . 4 8 \pm 0 . 1 5 )$ Ma from a layer ${ \sim } 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m }$ below the current vertebrate-defined boundary from Karoo Basin.

suggested the PTB should be higher than that recognized by Ward et al.(2005).The work in Karoo Basin suggested an older occurrence of Lystrosaurus,and the PTB could be around the base of the Jiucaiyuan Formation in Junggar Basin.

In 2ooo,some bones were collected from the SLS while digging a trench for paleomagnetic study. One specimen (IVPP V 23296) was produced from a green mudstone close to the yellow sandstone in Bed 40.All bones of this specimen are badly weathered, before being buried.Another specimen came from the red mudstone of Bed 70, including several vertebrae and a nearly complete humerus (IVPPV23295).Thesematerials were prepared and identified as a therocephalian and achroniosuchian.Therocephalian therapsids were important component of Middle Permian to Middle Triassic terrestrial faunas (Abdala et al.,2008,2014; Huttenlocker et al., 2015; Ivakhnenko,2011).In China, therocephalians are only known from the Triassic, including Urumchia lii recovered from the Jiucaiyuan Formation of Xinjiang,which was originally assigned as Late Permian (Li et al., 2008;

Young,1952).The new discoveries represent, thus, the first report of a Permian therocephalian for China. Chroniosuchians is an enigmatic and a recent addition to the group of tetrapods. It was first reported in the Permian and Triassic of Russia (Golubev,1998; Novikov and Shishkin, 2000; Shishkin et al.,2014),and later from the Permian of China (Li and Cheng,1999; Young, 1979),and the Triassic of Kyrgyzstan and Germany (Schoch et al., 2010; Witzmann et al., 2008).The new material here presented is a new Permian record for China,and the first one from Xinjiang.

HolotypeIVPP V 23296,incomplete left premaxilla with three teeth, incomplete right premaxille with four teeth, snout and part of the orbital region with the maxilla on both sides featuring functional and replacement canines, isolated vertebrae,left humerus, two phalanges and some bone fragments (Figs. 2-4).

Etymology‘Dalongkou’, the name of locality;‘fu’, dedicated to the preparator Ms. Fu Hua-Lin.

DiagnosisMaxilary ventral margin strongly concave in lateral view; incisors spatulated and rounded; incisors and canines with faint serrations; coronoid process of the dentary with a marked external adductor fossa; triangular reflected lamina of the angular with two smooth concavities.

Description Skull The skull is strongly deformed as a flat plate and broken into small blocks. The anterior portions of the premaxillae are separated from the rest of the skull (Fig. 2).

Both premaxillae are represented as independent elements,with the right being better preserved. It forms a curved plate housing the alveoli for four incisors (Fig. 2C). Posteromedially, it has the process for contacting the vomer.The posterolateral side of the palatal surface curves dorsally, forming the anterior margin of the palatal fenestra for the lower canine (Fig. 2C). There are four preserved teeth, three of them with the main axis of their bases oriented longitudinally,whereas the second is circular in section.The latter tooth, is completely preserved, presenting spatulated crown,concave lingually, and mesiolingual and distal smooth ridges (Fig. 2E). Remaining teeth are incomplete lacking any ridge at their bases, where the external surface is relatively smooth. Based on the preservation, we interpret the probable presence of at least five incisors.Two replacing teeth lie on the lingual side of the first and third functional incisors (Fig.2C). The crown of the first replacement incisor show fainted serrations on the medial margin.A tiny foramen lies posterior to the first replacing incisor. A long diastema separated the last incisor and the canine. The left premaxilla has three poorly preserved incisors and an extra alveolus for the fourth incisor, without tooth. There are pits with replacement teeth behind the second and third incisors.

The maxilla is a long bone with large facial plate.It extends anteriorly and covers the lateral surface of the premaxilla anterior to the canine. Ventrally, there is a concave ventral step.The maxilla is laterally expanded to encapsulate the canine,and the snout seems constricted behind the canine.On the right side,the facial plate is folded medially, and a remarkable longitudinal ridge is present, suggesting a well exposed maxillary platform. The platform is posteriorly concave in lateral view as in Theriognathus microps (Huttenlocker and Abdala, 2016). The root of the left canine is exposed posteriorly. An erupting replacing canine lies anteromedially to the canine on both sides. The maxillary ventral margin is strongly concave in lateral view.The postcanines are not observed on the skull, but some isolated teeth could be postcanines.Two of them preserved the base of the crown,and it is possible to see strong ridges on two margins without serration. One margin is remarkable concave, the other is straight to slightly concave. One preserved tip of postcanine have faint serrations on both margins of the cusp.The putative preserved postcanines are much smaller than the incisors.

Scale bar equals 1 cm

The nasal is long and forms the dorsal surface of the snout.A middle ridge is present on the posterior portion of the nasal.It is sutured with the frontal on the level of the anterior margin of the orbit (Fig. 2A). Laterally, it contacts the maxilla and the prefrontal. The prefrontal, frontal and postorbital form the dorsal margin of the orbit,whereas the postorbital bar is formed by the postorbital and jugal.

Lower jaw Dentary The symphyseal region and the posterior part of the left dentary is preserved,as well as the right reflected lamina of the angular (Fig.3).The articular symphysis with the right dentary is broken,and the lower margin is incomplete (Fig.3B).The symphyseal region bears a marked constriction lateral to the lower canine where the upper canine rests. The anterior part of this region bears pits and grooves, whereas the surface that will be contacting the medial side of the upper canine is smooth. The posteroventral portion of the dentary forms a thickened lower border that supports the angular in a trough on its medial surface (Fig. 3B). The posteroventral corner of the dentary forms an angle of $1 3 7 ^ { \circ }$ .The coronoid process is well developed, with a dorsal adductor fossa on the lateral surface (Fig.3A). The posteroventral margin of the dentary, below the bulged ridge that limits ventrally the adductor fossa, forms a descending flange ending in a sharp ridge. Although the posterodorsal corner is incomplete, the preserved portion shows a nearly straight posterodorsal margin. Six teeth are preserved on the symphyseal region. The biggest one is the canine,and anteromedially there is a replacing canine that is partially wrapped by it (Fig. 3C). Faint serrations developed on the anterior margin of the replacing canine.There are four lower incisors, including three preserved teeth and one alveolus (Fig.3C).A tiny tip of an erupting tooth lies immediately anterior to the canines.The last incisor is small and partially preserved; whereas two other incisors, medial to the later, are also preserved. One of them is faceted showing a well-developed ridge laterally (the medial side is not exposed). Very fine serrations,only visible under microscope magnification, are present on the margins of the larger two preserved incisors.

AngularThe right angular is nearly complete.This bone is flat and elongated posteriorly with a triangular-like reflected lamina (Fig. 3D,E). The large reflected lamina bears a deep ‘U'-shaped dorsal notch which is posterodorsally directed (Fig. 3D). The lateral surface of the reflected lamina is ornamented by fine,radiating ridges and grooves,and is divided into three parts by large grooves directed ventrally and posteriorly (Fig. 3D).

PrearticularThe prearticular lies on the medial side of the angular (Fig. 3E). It is an elongate element forming an anterior rod to contact the splenial.Posteriorly,it is a triangular plate,whose posterior process contacts the articular.

VertebraeTwo partial vertebrae including centra and a left partial neural arch are represented.The complete centrum in one of them, interpreted as dorsal vertebra, is amphicoelous,and deeply hollowed. The second element has an incomplete centrum and a clear suture between the centrum and the right partial neural arch shows lack of synostosis between them (Fig. 4A,B). The transverse process extends dorsolaterally and is angled posterolaterally, with a vertical flange on the ventral side.This is similar to the dorsal vertebra ofPromoschorhynchus platyrhinus (Huttenlocker et al., 2011).

The isolated arch is possible of a cervical vertebra, with its zygapophyses bearing more or less horizontal articulating surfaces (Fig. 4C, D). The transverse process is not preserved and should lie well down on the neural arches.The neural spine is robust and inclines anteriorly. This is similar to the cervical of Olivierosuchus parringtoni (Botha-Brink and Modesto,2011).

Sternum A partial posterior margin of the sternum is preserved (Fig. 4G, H). It is a large plate with convex ventral surface and concave dorsal surface.There is no posterior notch,and a weak midline ridge is developed on the ventral surface,as in Promoschorhynchus platyrhinus (Huttenlocker et al., 2011).

HumerusThe humerus is robust with expanded proximal end, missing the distal end and the deltopectoral crest (Fig. 4I-L). The proximal half is curved dorsally relative to the shaft (Fig. 4J,L). A low ridge lies on the rough posterodorsal side, possible representing part of the wide posteroventral ridge described by Kemp (1986). The long shaft is broken on the place of the entepicondylar foramen.

PhalangesTwo phalanges are well preserved (Fig. 4E,F). A longitudinal middle groove develops on the ventral surface. They are nearly as wide as length. Nearly quadrangular phalanges are represented in several therocephalians including the Scylacosauridae Glanosuchus,the Akidnognathidae Olivierosuchus,the Hofmeyriid Mirotenthes and the Whaitsiidae Theriognathus (Atridge,1956; Boonstra,1964; Botha-Brink and Modesto,2011; Fourie and Rubidge,2oo7;Abdala, pers. obs).

Referred specimenIVPP V 23295, five vertebrae, rib, gastral scales,partial ilium, left femur, and partial fibula (Figs. 5, 6).

Description Vertebrae Three articulated vertebrae show two intercentra, two isolated pleurocentra are fused to the neural arches,and there are three isolated intercentra. Four larger vertebrae are tentatively identified as dorsals and the smallest as caudal.

The morphology of the vertebrae is very similar to that of Bystrowiana sinica or Bystrowiella schumanni (Liu et al., 2014; Witzmann et al.,2008) (Fig. 5).

The length of the large pleurocentrum is approximately $1 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，whereas the length in the other two is 12 and $1 0 \mathrm { m m }$ . The pleurocentrum are roughly twice as long anteroposteriorly as the intercentra. The height of the pleurocentra is about $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ . All pleurocentra are deeply amphicoelous with a round cross-section,and they are not perforated by the notochord. In lateral view, the anterior and posterior margins of the pleurocentrum are curved but the ventral margin is nearly straight.A small knob (parapophysis) for the capitulum lies on the middle of the pleurocentrum anterior margin (Fig. 5B,E),and a longitudinal faint ridge runs posterior to it.The parapophysis is separated from the diapophysis by an anterodorsally directed incisure. On the larger pleurocentrum, the ventral surface is slightly convex to smooth (Fig. 5E). On the smallest pleurocentrum,two anteroposteriorly directed,low ridges delimit the faintly concave ventral margin (Fig. 5I) as in Bystrowiella schumanni (Witzmann et al., 2008).

Scale bar equals 1 cm

The intercentra are about as tall as the pleurocentra in lateral view. The articular intercentra show smooth periosteal bone, without haemal arch on the ventral surface. They appear wedge-like in articulation (Fig.5B,E),but actually are ball-like (Fig. 5K-M). On three free caudal intercentra,the ventral surface consists of slightly concave, smooth periosteal bone, and bears the ventrolateral bases of the hemapophyses as in Bystrowiella schumanni (Witzmann et al.,2Oo8).The roughened dorsal surface of the intercentrum is convex and did not articulate with the neural arch, forming part of the base of the neural canal. The largest intercentrum measures $9 . 7 \mathrm { m m }$ long,while the others range from 8 to $9 \mathrm { m m }$ . The exposed length of them in ventral view is nearly $5 \mathrm { m m }$

All neural arches are fused to the pleurocentrum and the spines only preserved at their base.The zygapophyses are widely spaced (Fig. 5D,E) and the facets slope medially at a small angle to the horizontal plane in anterior view. There are two pairs of well-developed paraneural canals at the base of the zygapophyses,with the anterior openings of the dorsal pair being larger than those of the lateral pair (Fig.5A).As in Bystrowiana permira,the number and shape of the openings on the two sides could be different (Liu et al., 2014).The neural canal is compressed dorsoventrally. The short transverse process lies on the upper half of the pleurocentrum, bearing small, unfinished diapophyses (Fig. 5A-C).

Rib and gastral scalesA proximal rib fragment,and some gastral scales are preserved on a bone plate (Fig. 5J). The gastral scales are thin, some ending in a sharp point.

IliumThe preserved acetabular area of the right ilium is similar to that of Dendrysecos helogenes or Chroniosaurus (Clack and Klembara, 2009; Holmes et al.,1998; Schoch and Milner, 2014). The anterior margin is slightly concave (Fig. 6A). There is a distinct crescent supra-acetabular buttress,and, anteroventrally, a notch on the anterior margin of acetabulum. The iliac blade is only preserved as a narrow base above the acetabular rim. On the medial side, a strong iliac ridge runs dorsoventrally and divides the medial surface in two portions (Fig. 6B).

FemurThe slender left femur is well-ossified and nearly complete (Fig. 6C-H). The general shape of the bone is same as that of Chroniosaurus (Clack and Klembara, 2009). The length of the bone is $7 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and the width is $2 1 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ for proximal and distal ends.The distal side deflects ventrally relative to the proximal part, so the bone is curved dorsally. The anterior margin is curved while the posterior margin is relatively straight.Differing from Chroniosaurus dongusensis,the articular surface on the proximal side is smoothly convex and dorsoventrally flattened (Fig. 6C).The dorsoventral height of the articular surface is near half its anteroposterior length (Fig. 6G). The proximal extensor surface of the femur bears some striations on the posterior side (Fig. 6C),indicating the insertion for the ischiotrochantericus.

On the anteroflexor side, the ventrally directed adductor blade demarcates the anterior side of the deep intertrochanteric fossa (Fig. 6D,E).The broken internal trochanter is separated from the femoral head by a narrow ridge,and it continues distally as a low crest, the fourth trochanter (Fig. 6D). The anterior surface of the adductor blade is rugose with deep muscle scars.

From the distal end of the fourth trochanter, the adductor crest follows a strongly diagonal course posteroventrally to a point distal to the middle of the shaft (Fig. 6E,F).A low ridge continues distally on the posterior side of the shaft ending on the distal posterior corner. This ridge does not seem to be for muscle attachment. In other groups such as captorhinomorphs, seymouriamorphs and temnospondyls, the adductor crest generally runs towards the popliteal area (Fox and Bowman,1966;Klembara and Bartik,20oo; Pawley, 2007).

The popliteal area is pitted and concave on the flexor side (Fig. 6E). The fibular (posterior)

Scale bar equals 1 cm

condyle projects more distally than the tibial (anterior) condyle.Proximal to the fibular condyle is a narrow but deep fibular fossa.In extensor view,a deeply incised intercondylar fossa is oriented posteroventrally towards the midline of the fibular condyle (Fig. 6H).

Fibula The proximal end of the left fibula is preserved (Fig. 6I-K). The head is convex to fit on the concave articular surface of the femur. Small striae distribute around the proximal articular surface (Fig. 6I, K), indicating the presence of cartilage or perhaps ligamentous connective tissue.The extensor surface is incised by a cnemial trough,which is bordered anteriorly by the prominent cnemial crest (Fig.6J). Another crest is on the posterior surface of the bone.A striate area on the medial side of this ridge, distal to the proximal articular surface, provided attachment for muscles.

# 3 Discussion

The new therapsid specimen (IVPP V 23296) can be diagnosed as a therocephalian for the presence of palatal fenestra for the lower caniniform confluent with choana,and the posterventral portion of the dentary forming a thickened lower border that extends below the angular bone and supports the latter in a trough on its medial surface.It has four lower incisors,and can be then diagnosed as an eutherocephalian (Huttenlocker,2Oo9).In addition, the shape of the reflected lamina,lacking an anterodorsal rounded portion in front of the notch that makes this structure circular in basal therocephalians is also an indication that the new species is member of Eutherocephalia.

Dalongkoua fuae show evidence of faint serrations in the margin of a replacement incisor and canine and on the tip of a postcanine.These findings are contrary to the assumed absence of serrations in the dentition of eutherocephalia (e.g.van den Heever, 1994; Abdala et al.,2008;Hutenlocker,2009;and Huttenlocker et al.,2015,for incisors and Huttenlocker and Sidor, 2O12 for anterior dentition). The serrations in the teeth of Dalongkoua fuae are exceedingly faint and it is clear that they will disappear with a minimum wear as demonstrated by the smoothly ridged crown of the preserved elements.

This specimen represents a new species on the basis of the following characters: maxillary ventral margin is strongly concave in lateral view; incisors spatulated and rounded; incisors and canines with faint serrations; coronoid process of the dentary with a marked adductor fossa; triangular reflected lamina with two concavities.

The maxillary ventral margin is convex or nearly straight in most therocephalians, but it is slightly concave in Moschowhaitsia (Ivakhnenko,2011),and strongly concave in Euchambersia and Theriognathus (Broom,1931; Huttenlocker and Abdala, 2016). Recent studies (e.g.,Huttenlocker et al., 2O15) indicate that spatulated incisors are restricted to a group of akidnognathids. In Dalongkoua fuae the completely preserved second left incisor is spatulated, whereas remaining left incisors,although incomplete,show the crown enough preserved to suggest the presence of rounded (non-spatulated) incisors.The adductor fossa is developed in the dorsolateral portion of the coronoid process,above of the through for the postdentary bones. This fossa is different to the one described on the lateral surface of the dentary in the bauriids Microgomphodon oligocynus (Abdala et al.,2014) and in the Russian Notogomphodon danilovi (Abdala,pers. obs.),as in these taxa there is no connection between the fossa and the through for the postdentary bones.The incomplete left dentary of Urumchia lii also seems to have an adductor fossa, although less developed than in $D$ fuae (Fig. 7). A triangular reflected lamina is also present in the holotype of Tetracynodon darti,but the lamina show a more complex lateral surface with several ridges and valley.In the lamina of $D _ { \cdot }$ fuae there is a posterior deep canal and a dorso-ventrally oriented shallow and wide depression.

Urumchia li is the only known therocephalian from the Xinjiang,documented in the Jiucaiyuan Formation (Sun, 1991; Young,1952). Diagnostic characters in this species are concentrated in the palate and in the postcanine morphology (Li et al.,20o8; Sun,1991). Unfortunately both palate and postcanines are incompletely preserved in Dalongkoua fuae, the postcanines only represented by isolated fragments including two crown bases and one tip.There are however a set of characters shared between these two species indicating perhaps relationships (Fig.7): medial margin of the frontal bones directed dorsally in Dalongkoua fuae indicating the presence of a central ridge in the posterior internasal and interfrontal sutures, the presence of a depressed facial area of the maxilla immediately above of the dental series, also described recently in Ichibengops of East Africa by Huttenlocker et al (2015),an apparent development of an adductor fossa,although clearly smaller, in the left dentary of Urumchia lii; and the presence of spatulated incisors.The putative relationship between these two taxa should be considered as a working hypothesis,whose validation will require finding of additional material.

The new specimen of Reptiliomorpha (IVPP V 23295) is referred to chroniosuchian for the characteristic bal-and-socket joint between pleurocentra and intercentra (Ivakhnenko and Tverdokhlebova,198O).It can be further assigned to Bystrowianidae for paired paraneural canals on the vertebrae (Novikov et al., 20oo). The vertebrae show the similar morphology as other bystrowianids,and intercentra is similar to the figured for Bystrowiella schumanni (Novikov and Shishkin,20o0;Witzmann et al.,2008).The morphology of ilium,femur,and fibula is consistent with this taxonomic identity(Clack and Klembara,20o9;Ivachnenko and Tverdochlebova,198o). Unfortunately, no dermal scute was discovered, and no further identification could be made.

Chroniosuchian specimens in China were first reported from the Upper Permian Jiyuan fauna (Young,1979),and then from the Middle Permian Dashankou fauna (Li and Cheng, 1999). The new findings here reported represent the latest occurrence of chroniosuchians in

China.This group however is known from the Middle/Upper Triassic Madygen Formation of Kyrgyzstan (Schoch et al., 2O1O), indicating their continued presence in Laurasia after the Permian exctinction.

These new findings allow recognizing that the diversity of tetrapod near the Permo-Triassic boundary in China,and particularly in Xinjiang, was higher than previously recognized. Only dicynodonts were previously reported from the Guodikeng Formation, including Lystrosaurus, Jimsaria, Turfanodon,and possibly Diictodon (Li et al.,2O08). Both chroniosuchians and therocephalians crossed the P-T boundary; therocephalians become extinct in the Middle Triassic (Abdala et al.,2O14), whereas the youngest record of chroniosuchians is in the Middle or Late Triassic (Schoch et al., 2010).

Abstract We provide a complete description of the skeletal anatomy of the holotype of Chiappeavis magnapremaxillo, the first enantiornithine to preserve a rectricial fan, suggesting that possibly rectricial bulbs were present in basal members of this clade.Notably,Chiappeavis preserves a primitive palatal morphology in which the vomers reach the premaxille similar to Archaeopteryx but unlike the condition in the Late Cretaceous enantiornithine Gobipteryx. If rectricial bulbs were present, pengornithid pygostyle morphology suggests they were minimally developed.We estimate the lift generated by the tail fan preserved in this specimen and compare it to the tail fans preserved in other Early Cretaceous birds.Aerodynamic models indicate the tail of Chiappeavis produced less lift than that of sympatric ornithuromorphs.This information provides a possble explanation for the absence of widespread aerodynamic tail morphologies in the Enantiornithes.

# 1 Introduction

Enantiornithes is the most diverse recognized group of Mesozoic birds,considered the first major avian radiation. Although specimens have been collected from continental and marine sediments on all continents with the exception of Antarctica,like other bird fossils,these remains are typically isolated and fragmentary (O'Connor et al.,2O11). The major exception is the Early Cretaceous deposits in northeastern China that have produced the 130.7-120 Ma Jehol Biota (Pan et al.,2013),preserving the second oldest recognized fossil avifauna surpassed only by the Late Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones in Germany that produce Archaeopteryx (Wellnhofer, 20o8). Despite its age, the Jehol avifauna accounts for approximately half of the entire diversity of Mesozoic birds including a huge diversity of enantiornithines (Wang M et al., 2014; Wang X et al., 2014; Zhou and Zhang, 2006). As new species steadily continue to be discovered, several distinct clades have been recognized (e.g., the Bohaiornithidae, Longipterygidae). The most temporally successful of these enantiornithines lineages is the Pengornithidae.The first specimen, the holotype of Pengornis houi,was described by Zhou et al. in 2Oo8 and already this group is one of the most diverse enantiornithine clades in the Jehol avifauna. Currently there are five specimens representing four genera (Pengornis,Parapengornis, Eopengornis,and Chiappeavis) (Hu et al.,2015; O'Connor et al.,2016; Wang X et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2008). The holotype of Pengornis houi is the largest known Early Cretaceous enantiornithine. Eopengornis is from the 130.7 Ma Protopteryx-horizon of the Huajiying Formation and all other taxa are from the $1 2 0 \ \mathrm { M a }$ Jiufotang Formation. Pengornithids are the most recognizable enantiornithines,with their characteristic numerous small,low-crowned teeth,hooked scapular acromion,bilaterally formed sternum without intermediate trabeculae,elongate femur, unreduced fibula, metatarsal V, and elongate metatarsal I and hallux.These characters are mostly primitive features strongly suggesting that pengornithids are basal within the Enantiornithes,consistent with recent phylogenetic analyses and the fact Eopengornis is among the oldest known enantiornithines (Wang X et al., 2014).

The most recently described pengornithid, Chiappeavis magnapremaxillo, preserves the first clear evidence that some members of the Enantiornithes possessed rectricial fans (Fig. 1),similar to those present in the basal pygostylian Sapeornis and members of the Ornithuromorpha (Clarke et al., 2006; Zheng et al.,2013), the clade that includes all living birds nested within. The unique shape of the pengornithid pygostyle, being relatively more similar to that of ornithuromorphs and Sapeornis than other enantiornithines,suggests that the rectricial fan evolves together with the rectricial bulbs necessary to control them, which in turn shapes the pygostyle (O'Connor et al., 2016). The holotype and only known specimen of Chiappeavis magnapremaxillo STM 29-1l was only briefly described with regards to its skeletal morphology. Here we provide a complete description and further explore the unique morphology of the pengornithid pygostyle.We reconstruct the tail fans of several well preserved Jehol ornithuromorphs and compare the aerodynamic lift generated by different tail shapes and discuss the significance of this information.

# 2 Description

This description provides only new anatomical information regarding STM 29-11 (Fig. 2). The enlarged premaxillary corpus and elongate nasal processes that distinguish Chiappeavis from other pengornithids have already been described in detail (O'Connor et al.,2016). The maxillary process of the premaxilla is robust, sharply tapered,and roughly equal to the length of the corpus (Fig.3). The premaxille form a medial wedged articulation with the nasals although the extent of this articulation is unclear due to poor preservation of the nasals. A fragment of the left nasal is preserved articulating with the frontal; it appears narrower than the nasal in Pengornis IVPP V 15336 (Zhou et al.,2008).Although the maxilla forms most of the facial margin in Pengornis V 15336 (Zhou et al.,2008) and all other known pengornithids (Hu et al.,2014,2015; Wang X et al.,2014), only possible fragments are preserved in Chiappeavis STM 29-11. Part of the scleral ring is preserved in the orbit. Other fragments may represent pieces of the pterygoids. Ventrally,a thin, distally upturned rod-like element is identified as the jugal. A robust fragment of bone is preserved dorsal and in parallel to the jugal; this bone may be a piece of the jugal process of the maxilla but it appears unusually robust. Part of the palate is visible through the left external nares (Fig. 3). Both vomers are preserved presumably in dorsal view.As in Gobipteryx they appear to be fused along their rostral halves, caudally diverging at a $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ angle (nearly parallel in Gobipteryx).This suggests that like Gobipteryx the choana was rostrally located compared to neornithines (Chiappe et al., 20o1). However, unlike in Gobipteryx and neognathous birds, as preserved the vomers appear to retain the plesiomorphic tetrapod condition, reaching and presumably articulating with the premaxilae, as in paleognathous birds and potentially Archaeopteryx (Witmer and Martin, 1987).A fragment of bone preserved between the left vomer and the maxillary process of the premaxilla may be a piece of the maxillary contribution to the palate. The caudal half of the skull is poorly preserved, crushed and heavily abraded, revealing no anatomical details.The tip of the left dentary is blunt; barely visible, numerous small teeth are preserved in separate aveoli. The

postdentary bones are poorly preserved.

Approximately seven cervical vertebrae are poorly preserved in articulation with the skull (Fig.2). The cranial articular surfaces appear to be slightly concave.Proximally the cervicals are preserved in ventral view; distally the series appears in caudal view. The third preserved vertebra reveals small carotid processes. The costal processes are short and sharply tapered. The proximal portion of the thoracic series is obscured by overlap with the thoracic girdle. There are five visible dorsal vertebrae;the first two are disarticulated but the distal three are in articulation with the synsacrum. The dorsal vertebrae show the typical enantiornithine condition with the parapophyses located one-third from the proximal end and the lateral surface deeply

excavated by a groove (Chiappe and Walker, 2002).The neural spines of the synsacrum are fused into a continuous spinous crest, which narrows and decreases in height distally, as in V 15336. The first four transverse processes are quadrangular,short and wide; the last three are elongate and caudolaterally oriented and the fifth is intermediate in morphology (Figs.1,2). Five free caudal vertebrae are preserved, which is fewer than reported in other pengornithids (Hu et al., 2014,2015); the cranial articular surface is exposed in the first caudal vertebra revealing a weakly concave surface.The transverse processes are long, approximately equal to the centrum width. The neural canal is smaller than the size of the exposed caudal articular surfaces.The unfused haemel arches are rectangular with blunt distal margins.

Asnoted in a more detailed study of the pygostyle(Wang and O'Connor, in press) the pengormithid pygostyle bears all the same

characteristic features of other enantiornithines,although this clade differs in how these morphologies are expressed. The pygostyle of Chiappeavis has a pair of ventrolateral processes restricted to the proximal ventral half of the pygostyle whereas in other enantiornithines these processes extend for most of the pygostyle length (Chiappe and Walker,2002). The ventrolateral processes project further ventrally and are limited to the proximal third of the pygostyle in Pengornis V 15336 (Fig. 4B). Visible on the right, a small cranial fork is present and continuous with a dorsolateral process that appears to extend the entire length of the pygostyle (Fig. 4A). The dorsal surface between these dorsolateral processes is broadly concave as in other pengornithids,whereas this concavity is narrow and deeper in other enantiornithines, even when preserved dorsoventrally crushed (Wang and O'Connor, in press).

The left ramus of the furcula is preserved in dorsal view; the rami are slightly bowed

![](images/680618f057bd426e930be14ca60e319cd609e5a21b12ce66733c19f7be349186.jpg)

medially similar to Pengornis V 15336 (Fig.5).The dorsolateral excavation is limited to the proximal 2/3 of the ramus; the dorsal surfaceof the omalthirdis flat.The omal tip tapers bluntly,as in Pengornis V 15336,and is pitted and striated suggesting incomplete ossification of the articular surfaces.A hypocleidium was present,as in other pengornithids.As in Pengornis, the process measures approximately half the length of the furcular rami,whereas the hypocleidium appears proportionately longer in Parapengornis IVPP V 18687 (Fig.5).Both coracoids are in articulation with the coracoidal sulci of the sternum in

dorsal view; the dorsal lips of the sulci cover the sternal margin of the coracoids indicating that the sulci are deep.The acrocoracoid, glenoid and scapular articular surface are weakly aligned, as in other enantiornithines (Chiappe and Walker, 2O02). The poorly developed glenoid and scapular cotyla are separated by a deep pit, which may be an artefact of crushing and obscuring the presence of an acrocoracoidal tubercle. Just distal to the scapular articular surface the supracoracoid nerve foramen pierces the neck of the coracoid, separated from the medial margin by a complete boney bar; it does not appear to open into a medially located groove as it does in many other enantiornithines (Chiappe and Walker, 2Oo2). The corpus makes up the distal half of the coracoid. The distal quarter of the lateral margin is convex, expanding the width of the sternal margin. The convex distal portion of the lateral margin appears distinctly thinner and flatter than the rest of the coracoidal corpus.This morphology of the lateral margin of the coracoid is also observed in other pengornithids (Eopengornis,Parapengornis V 18687) as well as bohaiornithid enantiornithines (Wang M et al., 2014). The corpus is weakly excavated by a shallow dorsal fossa,also observed in some ornithuromorph birds (e.g., Yixianornis), inferred to be the attachment of the m. supracoracoideus (Clarke et al., 2006).

The left scapula in lateral view overlaps the right in costal view, and where the two shafts overlap the left is missing a piece of the shaft; both distal ends are unclear. The scapular acromion process is slightly longer than the glenoid facet and hooked, as in other pengornithid enantiornithines (Wang X et al.,2O14).The cranial margin of the process is wide and flat. The scapular glenoid facet is large, concave, slightly tapered distally and forming a labum where it contacts the scapular blade (Fig. 6).The body of the scapula is relatively wide and short as in other pengornithids. The costal surface is smooth,lacking the groove present in more derived enantiornithines (e.g.Elsornis,Neuquenornis) (Chiappe and Walker, 2002).

The straight coracoidal sulci meet at an $1 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ angle so that the rostral margin of the sternum is weakly vaulted (Fig. 6). The craniolateral corners are weakly developed into slight dorsolateral projections but no distinct craniolateral process is present. The entire lateral margin of the sternum including the lateral trabecula is weakly concave.The dorsal surface of each trabecula is keled giving this process a triangular cross-section; distally the apex moves from dorsolaterally located to centered on the dorsal surface and the distal third is flat. The distal ends of the trabeculae are weakly expanded - this area of bone is also heavily pitted and striated indicating ossification was incomplete.The lateral trabeculae extend distally beyond the caudal margin of the xiphial region,as in $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 1 8 6 3 2$ (level with caudal margin in Eopengornis STM 24-11). The lateral margins of the median trabeculae are concave as the sternal plates narrow caudally, whereas they are straight in Eopengornis and Parapengornis. Compared to other known pengornithids,the xiphial region is more elongate and narrow in STM 29-11 forming an incipient xiphoid process and defining approximately a $4 0 ^ { \circ }$ angle ( $7 5 ^ { \circ }$ in Eopengornis and $7 0 ^ { \circ }$ Parapengornis). The xiphial region bears a short, straight caudal margin,absent in Eopengornis and V 18632,in which the xiphial region defines a blunt V-shaped margin (Hu et al., 2014; Wang X et al.,2014). Given the lack of maturity in all specimens preserving sternal material, these apparent differences in the morphology of the distal ends of the lateral trabeculae and proportions of the xiphial region may change with the discovery of adult material. However, features like the concavity of the lateral margins in Chiappeavis STM 29-11 are unlikely to change at this stage in maturity.

Well-defined costal facets are not visible but three robust sternal ribs are visible articulating on the right costal margin of the sternum.The third rib is more robust than the others and has an uneven caudal margin that may be pathological in origin (Fig. 6). The left sternal ribs are displaced over the dorsal surface of the sternum- they are short,robust, and weakly curved.Several disarticulated thoracic ribs are preserved;a few are located cranial to the sternum and a few are associated with this element. Compared to the cranially located ribs,the ribs preserved near and overlying the sternum are shorter, more robust, and more weakly curved, and probably articulated with the sternal ribs.

The left humerus is preserved in cranial view,while the rightis in caudal view.Proximally in caudal view, the ventral tubercleis small, separated by a wide,shallow capital incision,and a pneumatic fossa is absent. In cranial view, a small bicipital crest is present, weakly projecting cranially. The width of the deltopectoral crest is less than the width of the shaft and extends along the proximal third of the humerus.The shaft weakly increases in width distally

from its narrowest point located midshaft, also observed in other pengornithids.The distal caudal surface is poorly preserved revealing no anatomical details.The distal condyles are small and located primarily on the cranial surface as in other birds.The circular dorsal condyle is larger than the oval ventral condyle, although the two are approximately equal in diameter. The long axis of the ventral condyle is transversely oriented. The round ventral epicondyle is smaller than the ventral condyle,and located on the craniodistal surface of the ventrodistal margin. The brachial fossa is not developed.

Both antebrachia are complete; the left is in caudal view and the right is cranially exposed.As in other basal birds the ulnae are bowed along their proximal halves.The dorsal cotyla is flat and the ventral cotyla appears slightly concave. The radii are straight and more than half the thickness of the ulna; crushing prevents identification of a longitudinal groove like that present on the interosseous surface of some enantiornithines (Chiappe and Walker, 2002).

The ulnare is U-shaped; one ramus is bluntly tapered,while the other is short and more robust, similar to that of Pengornis V15336.The radiale is quadrangular but it is unclear which surface is exposed. The semilunate carpal appears only partially fused to the metacarpals. The right alular metacarpal is preserved unfused to the major metacarpal. It is narrow and approximately 1/5 the length of the carpometacarpus. The proximal end is rounded and the distal end appears ginglymous. As in V 15336 the proximal end of the minor metacarpal wraps onto the ventral surface of the major metacarpal and the ventral surface of the proximal third of the minor metacarpal forms a ridge rather than a distinct pisiform process, a morphology common in Early Cretaceous enantiornithines (O'Connor, 2O09).The first phalanx of the major digit is incomplete but like other enantiornithines it maintains the plesiomorphic theropod condition and lacks any caudal expansion like that present in ornithuromorph birds. The penultimate phalanx is not preserved; the ungual phalanx is small and weakly curved. The first phalanx of the minor digit is wedge-shaped with a flat cranial margin and convex caudal margin, tapering to a blunt distal margin.

Both ilia are preserved in articulation with the synsacrum (Figs.1,2). The right ilium is preserved in medial view while the left appears in dorsal view.In lateral view, the dorsal margin is weakly convex. The ventral margins of the preacetabular and postacetabular alae are straight. The pubic pedicel of the ischium is wider than the iliac pedicel. The preacetabular wing is longer and dorsoventrally taller than the postacetabular wing and the postacetabular wing is bluntly tapered as in V 18632 and most enantiornithines.The right ischium, preserved in medial view,is long,delicate and gently tapered; the dorsal margin is concave and the ventral margin is convex (Figs.1, 2). The pubes have a thick oval cross section with a craniodorsal-caudoventrally oriented long axis. The distal third is heavily pitted and striated.

Both femora are preserved although the right is overlain by the pubes and ischia and the proximal end is not exposed on either side (Figs.1,2).As described,a smal tibiofibular crest is present distally (O'Connor et al.,20l6). The right tibia is in caudal view exposing the popliteal tuberosity and lateral articular facet on the proximocaudal surface,also developed in Pengornis and Eopengornis (Wang X et al.,2Ol4). The flexor fossa is weak or absent. The left tibia is exposed in craniolateral view; the proximal tarsals are fused to each other forming the condyles. The medial condyle is wider than the lateral condyle. They are separated by a wide,shallow intercondylar incisure.The lateral margin of the lateral condyle and the medial margin of the medial condyle are both straight and the opposing surfaces are strongly convex, as in Pengornis V 15336.The lateral condyle is excavated by a deep concavity on the lateral surface as in some enantiornithines (e.g., Qiliania) (Ji et al., 2O11). The ascending process is triangular, tapering proximally,and taller than the height of the condyles. Only the right fibula is preserved and it is incomplete so it cannot be determined if it reached the distal condyles as in other pengornithids (Wang X et al., 2014).

No distal tarsals are preserved,as in other pengornithids. The metatarsals are unfused and slightly disarticulated; the exposed surfaces are abraded, preserving very litle information. Metatarsal IV is thinner than metatarsal III, which is in turn thinner than metatarsal II.The digit of metatarsal II is robust with a large ungual phalanx; the ungual phalanx in digit III is long but not as robust as those of digits Iand II.The digit IV ungual is the smallest. No metatarsal V is preserved although it was likely present, as in other pengornithids (Wang X et al., 2014).

Ontogenetic status STM 29-11 is clearly immature based on the incomplete ossification of the periosteal surface of the bone evident from the striated pits that sparsely cover the surface of most elements.As would be expected, fusion is incomplete in the sternum and proximal carpometacarpus,and the compound bones of the hindlimb have yet to fully coossify.The compound bones of the axial skeleton, the pygostyle and synsacrum,are fully fused in all subadult enantiornithine specimens supporting the inference that the difference in the number of sacral vertebrae is a true distinction between Chiappeavis and Pengornis. The age of the specimen has not been explored through histology because there are no breaks in the long bones of STM 29-11 to allow non-destructive sampling of this particularly nice specimen. However, the sternum is fully fused in the subadult holotype of Eopengornis martini STM 24-1 and V18632.This indicates that STM 29-11 is at a relatively earlier ontogenetic stage and strongly suggests it would have increased in size with maturity. The sternum in Parapengornis V 18687 is also medially unfused, despite its much smaller size (Table 1) and histology confirms that this specimen is immature, with no remodelling present to indicate the individual was mature or nearly so. Parapengornis sp. V 18632 has a fully fused sternum but is roughly $1 5 \%$ smaller than Parapengornis V 18687 indicating these specimens may represent different species (see phylogenetic analysis). As preserved STM 29-11 is $20 \%$ smaller than the holotype of Pengornis houi V15336,although given the relative immaturity of the former specimen we suggest the terminal body size in Pengornis and Chiappeavis would have been similar.

# 3 Phylogenetic Analysis

We investigated the phylogenetic placement of Chiappeavis using a modified version of the O'Connor and Zhou (2013) dataset that includes the revised character 220 used by Wang X et al. (2014). The dataset includes five pengornithids: Eopengornis, Parapengornis IVPP V 18687 and IVPP V 18632, Pengornis,and Chiappeavis. (Hu et al., 2014, 2015; O'Connor et al.,2016; Wang X et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2008). The matrix includes a total of 63 taxa, 24 of which are referable to the Enantiornithes.Using TNT software (Goloboff et al., 2008) we conducted a heuristic search using tree-bisection reconnection (TBR) retaining the single shortest tree out of every 1,0o0 replications. This produced 824 most parsimonious trees with a length of 897 steps.A second round of TBR produced more than 10,000 trees of the same length.In the strict consensus,all nodes collapsed except Aves itself. Investigation of the MPTs revealed that in $78 \%$ of the trees Pengornithidae was resolved. The clade formed by Jeholornis $^ +$ all more derived birds collapses due to the basal position of the fragmentary taxon Chaoyangia resolved by a small percentage of MPTs. In order to reduce the effects of homoplasy (Goloboff et al.,2Oo8),which strongly characterizes early avian evolution (Brusatte et al.,2O15),we reran the analysis with the same parameters using implied weighting $( \mathbf { k } = 1 . 0$ 2.0,and 3.0) (Goloboff,1993).With a $\mathbf { k }$ value of 1.0, the analysis produced 24 trees ( $\mathrm { T B R } =$ 129.47). The strict consensus is well resolved with pengornithids forming successive outgroups to all other enantiornithines.With higher k values (2.0,3.0) Pengornithidae is resolved as a clade that is sister taxon to all other enantiornithines (Fig. 7).

# 4 Discussion

Pengornithid diversity Five pengornithid specimens are now recognized, representing at least four distinct genera (Chiappeavis,Eopengornis,Parapengornis,and Pengornis). Pengornithids are unusual birds,differing from other enantiornithines in the morphology of the sternum (e.g. ossifying from a pair of medially fused bilateral plates and having only a single pair of caudal trabeculae), pygostyle (shorter, wider, with proximally restricted ventrolateral processes, often having a midline invagination on the caudal margin),and ischium (slender without a dorsal process). In addition, they possess features more typical of long boney-tailed birds or basal pygostylians, such as the presence of a metatarsal V and an elongate fibula. This marked increase in homoplasy caused by the inclusion of five pengornithids has thus resulted in a collapse in weakly resolved relationships from previous analyses, making a strong case for the use of implied weighting. Without the use of implied weighting Pengornithidae is only resolved in $78 \%$ of the MPTs,but in $98 \%$ of all MPTs V18632 and Eopengornis form a clade, thus not supporting previous inferences that V 18632 should be referred to Parapengornis (Hu et al.,2015). This is further supported by differences in body size between V 18632 and Parapengornis $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 1 8 6 8 7$ (see Ontogenetic status). Difference in size, morphology (Fig. 5), and stratigraphic level also suggest $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 1 8 6 3 2$ is not referable to Eopengornis martini.Because the specimen is a subadult, Hu et al., (2014) originally refrained from naming V18632 (Pengornis sp.),later referring it to Parapengornis (Hu et al., 2015).Here we regard this specimen as Pengornithidae indeterminate.Notably, Eopengornis and Parapengornis share a common tail morphology consisting of a pair of elongate, fully pennaceous rachis dominated feathers but are not found to be closely related; instead,Eopengornis is found to be more closely related to Chiappeavis,despite their disparate tail morphologies. This may suggest that this analysis does not accurately portray pengornithid relationships or that pengornithid plumage was as evolutionarily labile as in extant avian families (Gluckman,2O14).In favor of the former, the pygostyle of Chiappeavis is most similar to that of Pengornis with regards to

Dromaeosauridae Archaeopteryx Jeholornis Eoconfuciusornis Confuciusornis dui 3S Conthiformes Jizhouorniszhangivingia Confuciusornis sanctus Didactylornis Sapeornis Parapengornis IVPP V18687 Pygostylia Pengornithidae 中 Peiapnivis IVPPV18632 Eopengornis Vescornis Protopteryx Otogornis Ornithothoraces Enantiornithes Gobipntiornis Concornis Shenqiornis Neuquenornis Elsornis Cathayornis Eocathayornis Liaoningornis Eoalulavis Longipteryx Boluochia Rapaxavis K = 3.000 Iberomesormis Longirostravis Patagopteryx Dingavis Archaeorhynchus Jianchangornis Zhongjianornis Chaoyangia JOrnithuromorpha Iteravis Vorona Schizooura Hongshanornis Longicrusavis Yixianornis Yanornis Hollanda Songlingornis Archaeornithura Gansus Apsaravis Ambiortus Enaliornis Baptornis advenus Baptornis varneri Parahesperornis Hesperornis Limenavis Ichthyornis Anas Gallus Vegavis

proportions, whereas that of Parapengornis and Eopengornis are slightly shorter, suggesting that Pengornis may have had a rectricial fan.This subtle interclade diversity is not captured by the abstract morphologies encapsulated by this and other current character matrices used for the phylogenetic analysis of Mesozoic birds.

Large body size (Table 1) and stratigraphic level (Jiufotang) suggest that Chiappeavis is more closely related to Pengornis than to Parapengornis (smaller) or Eopengornis (smaller, Huajiying), which is further supported by the morphology of the furcula (furcular rami curved in Chiappeavis and Pengornis whereas they are straight in Parapengornis) (Fig. 5). The sternum in Chiappeavis is proportionately more elongate (length greater than width) than in Parapengornis and Eopengornis (length and width subequal). It further differs from smaller pengornithids in the morphology of the xiphial region of the sternum: the lateral margins of median trabeculae are concave in the new taxon, whereas they are straight in Eopengornis and Parapengornis. Ontogenetic and preservational differences obfuscate comparison with Pengornis V15336.Postcranially,Pengornis V15336 and Chiappeavis STM29-11 are similar but STM 29-11 has a greater number of sacral vertebrae despite its immaturity (although the cranial margin of the synsacrum is obscured, clearly only seven sacrals are present in Pengornis V15336)and the proximal articular surface of the tibia is inclined.The increased number of sacral vertebrae and expanded premaxillae suggest Chiappeavis is more advanced than other pengornithids.

Tail-fan performance in Early Cretaceous birdsEven in the Jehol Biota,at the earliest known stage of pygostylian evolution with data limited by fossilization, there exist observable differences in the shape and relative size of the rectricial fan between clades and individual taxa. Compared to all Jehol ornithuromorphs preserving tail fans (Yixianornis, Yanornis,Hongshanornis,Schizooura,Piscivoravis) (Chiappe et al.,2014; Clarke et al.,2006) (Fig. 8), the tail is proportionately shorter relative to body length in Chiappeavis STM 29- 11 (Table 2). These taxa also differ in the degree of gradation (measured as the difference in length between the longest and shortest rectrices). Subtle differences in tail shape and length can be used to understand the selective pressures responsible for producing each phenotype. Lift is determined by the maximum continuous width, therefore any elongation beyond this point is considered the product of sexual selection,being not optimized for flight (Thomas and Balmford,1995). In one test area, $80 \%$ of all bird species were found to have tail displays of some kind (Fitzpatrick,1997). Although two tails of equal width have the same lift,longer tails generate greater moments for turning; the trade-off is that longer tails require greater muscle force and incur more drag (Thomas and Balmford,1995). Thus the huge diversity of avian tail morphologies represents the product of these and the numerous other selective forces that exist in the varied ecologies and lifestyles occupied by birds.The graded morphology in Sapeornis and even the round morphology in ornithuromorphs indicate that although capable of generating lift, these tails were not optimized for aerodynamic function, being also shaped by sexual/signal selection. The difference between the longest and shortest rectrices is highest in

Sapeornis and Chiappeavis suggesting this influence was strongest in these taxa. Shorter tails tend to be adapted for higher flight speeds and greater lift to drag ratios,whereas longer tails increase maneuverability and are found in woodland birds where the cluttered environment selects for increased maneuverability and high-speed flight is infrequent (Thomas,1997; Thomas and Balmford,1995). Thus the presence of long round-tails in most ornithuromorphs indicates these taxa well adapted for the forested Jehol paleoenvironment (Zhou, 2004). Since longer tails require greater muscle force,the proportionately shorter tail in Chiappeavis supports inferences based on pygostyle morphology that rectricial bulbs,if present, were poorly developed in enantiornithines. Some extant birds have a pygostyle similar to that of enantiornithines in which the dorsal surface is expanded (having a dorsal platform and thus no dorsally blade-like pygostyle lamina) to provide additional surface area for the attachment of enlarged caudal levator muscles,yet these taxa retain rectricial bulbs (Wang and O'Connor, in press). Thus the absence of a pygostyle lamina does not exclude enantiornithines from having this structure.

Yixianornis IVPP V12631; E. Chiappeavis STM29-11. Rectricial fans and pygostyles are drawn to scale; scale bar equals $2 \mathrm { c m }$

In order to more directly quantify aerodynamic differences in tail shape we reconstructed the rectricial fan for several taxa based on the specimens most clearly preserving this feature (Table 2) and estimated their lift (Thomas,1993). We recognize that the preserved width is not necessarily the optimal or maximal spread of the tail in flight, but like living birds we assume a range of widths were possible at least in the Ornithuromorpha. We assume equal postmortem compression of the rectricial bulbs (or comparable tail musculature in Chiappeavis and Sapeornis) resulting in a comparable degree of tail spread between Jehol specimens. Specimens preserved in lateral view were considered unsuitable for analysis.For Jehol birds these measurements represent conservative estimates of the tail's lift capabilities. The tail fan of Chiappeavis is estimated to have the least efficient tail shape, whereas the tails in most Jehol ornithuromorphs have almost double the lifting power for their given body mass (Table 2). These measurements support our predictions based on the shape of the pygostyle and associated rectricial fan. The limited function of the enantiornithine tail fan,quantified here for the first time,provides support for the hypothesis that this is the cause of the restricted distribution of this feature in the Enantiornithes.Paired with limited musculature (as inferred from pygostyle morphology）and the potential absence of the ability to control the spread of the tail fan,the enantiornithine aerodynamic rectricial fan may not have provided a great enough reproductive advantage to be retained through natural selection. This is at odds with derived skeletal features present in Chiappeavis (enlarged premaxilla, longer synsacrum), which may alternatively suggest that a tail fan was independently evolved in the Chiappeavis lineage.

摘要：契氏鸟(Chiappeavis)是首次发现保存有扇状尾羽的反鸟类，显示出尾羽球茎这一结构在较原始的反鸟类中已经发育。详细描述了巨前颌契氏鸟(C.magnapremaxill)正型标本的骨骼形态学特征。契氏鸟的腭区形态与始祖鸟(Archaeopteryx)相似，而区别于晚白垩世的反鸟类戈壁鸟(Gobipteryx)。即使具有尾羽球茎，鹏鸟类的尾综骨形态也表明该结构发育较差。估算了在契氏鸟中由扇状尾羽所产生的浮力，并与其他早白垩世鸟类进行对比。结果显示，契氏鸟的扇状尾羽所产生的空气浮力小于同时代生活的今鸟型类，这有可能解释了反鸟类中具有空气动力学功能的尾羽形态普遍缺乏的现象。

Abstract One specimen of Elephas cf.E. planifrons is reported and described here in the present paper. The specimen was recovered from the mudstone horizon underlying the volcanic ash bed exposed near the Nangal village,which is the extension of geochronological dated $( 2 . 4 8 ~ \mathrm { M a } )$ （2 volcanic ash beds exposed at Barakhetar in the Nagrota Formation of Upper Siwalik Subgroup of Samba district,Jammu and Kashmir, India. Based on the crown morphological parameters (plate numbers,molars length and width,crown length,width and height,enamel thickness, dentine thickness,length and width of plates,lamellar frequency,hypsodonty index and cement thickness),the specimen has been identified and is tentatively referred to Elephas cf.E.planifrons (LM3).The recovery of this specimen is of great significance as it extends its upper limit of range zone from 3.6-2.6 to 3.6-2.48 Ma.

In Indian subcontinent, the genus Elephas is represented by four species (E. planifrons, E.hysudricus,E.namadicus,and $E$ .maximus).In these four species,the first three( $E$ planifrons,E.hysudricus, $E$ 、namadicus） were extinct completely from Indian subcontinent and the last one (E.maximus) is surviving tilldate. Detailed studies on geology, palaeontology, phylogeny and age of the elephantidea fauna (Steglophodon nathotenis, Steglophodon latidens, Steglophodon cautleyi, Stegodon clifti, Stegodon bombifrons,Stegodon pinjorensis,

Archidiskodon planifrons,Elephas hysudricus,E.maximus,E. hysudrindicus,E. planifrons, Palaeoloxodon namadicus) from the Siwalik of India, Pakistan and Burma were carried out by various authors (Osborn,1942; Sahni and Khan,1959; Chakravarti,1965; Opdyke et al.,1979; Azzaroli and Nepoleone,1981; Badam and Kumar, 1982; Tripathi and Basu,1983; Nanda et al.,1991; Samiullah et al., 2014).

In Siwalik Province of Jammu, Jammu & Kashmir State, India no detailed work on Elephantidae fauna was carried out except for a few workers (Wadia,1925; Ganjoo,1985; Nanda,1994; Kundal and Kundal,2011; Sankhyan and Sharma,2014).Wadia (1925) first time recovered a tusk (about $3 . 4 3 \mathrm { ~ m }$ ）of Stegodon ganesa from near the Jagti village of Nagrota Formation of Upper Siwalik Subgroup of Jammu. Ganjoo (1985) recovered dental remains of Stegolophodon sp., Stegodon insignis,Stegodon ganesa and Elephas sp. from the Pleistocene deposits of Khanpur Formation (Pinjor Formation) and Tawi Formation (Boulder Formation) of Upper Siwalik Subgroup of Jammu region. The comment on certain faunal discrepancies on Upper Siwalik mammalian faunas from Chandigarh and Jammu area was given by Nanda (1994). A lot of specimens of proboscidean were collected by the Geological Survey of India from the Siwalik of Jammu and other part of Siwalik of India and these specimens have been published in the Catalogue series no.5 in the year 2Oo2.An appraisal of diversity and habitats of Siwalik mammals of the Jammu Sub-Himalaya was discussed by Basu (2oo4). Recently, Kundal and Kundal (2011) recovered an upper right third molar (M3)of Elephas maximus indicus from the post Siwalik deposits of Jammu Province near Kharian vilage, Jammu and Kashmir, India. A few workers (Prasad et al., 2005; Bhat et al., 2008; Bhandari and Kundal, 2008; Kundal and Prasad,2011; Kundal et al.,2011; Kundal, 2012, 2013,2015) carried out detailed studies on fossils recovered from mudstone horizons associated with geochronologically dated volcanic ash occurring in Upper Siwalik of Jammu and its depositional environment. In the present study,the systematics and biochronology of Elephas cf.E. planifrons recovered from the Nangal village of Nagrota Formation, Upper Siwalik Subgroup of Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir has been carried out. The area in this study is given in Fig. 1A.

Geological, palaeontological and palaeomagnetic studies of type sections of Siwalik in Indian subcontinent have been carried out from time to time by various workers (Colbert,1935; Lewis,1937; Wadia,1957; Keller et al.,1977; Opdyke et al.,1979,1982; Johnson et al.,1982, 1985; Barry et al.,1982,2002,2013; Barry and Flynn,1990; Flynn et al.,1995,2013; Badgley et al.,2005,2008; Patnaik, 2013) and revealed that the boundaries are time transgressive in between most of Formations of the Siwalik Group and that temporal mammals ranges are not usually fixed within the time limits of these Formations.A generalized stratigraphic framework of Siwalik in Indian Subcontinent is given in Fig.1D.

The local classifications of Upper Siwalik Subgroup of Jammu-Samba district of Jammu Province based on palaeontology, magnetostratigraphy and radiometric date of ash beds were given by Ranga Rao et al. (1988),Agarwal et al. (1993) and Gupta (2000). A comparative lithostratigraphic classification of Siwalik Group of Jammu Province in Jammu and Kashmir,

India is given in Fig.1E. In Pinjor/Nagrota Formation,a volcanic ash bed is occurring at near Barakhetar and Nagrota villages which have been geochronologically dated $2 . 4 8 ~ \mathrm { M a }$ .These ash beds straddle across Gauss-Matuyama boundary in the Siwalik of Jammu-Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir, India (Ranga Rao et al.,1988). The specimen described in the present study was discovered from the mudstone horizon immediately underlying geochronologically dated $2 . 4 8 \ \mathrm { M a }$ volcanic ash bed at Nangal village which is the extension of Barakhetar ash bed and now is preserved in the vertebrate palaeontology laboratory, Geology Department of Jammu University, under catalog number JU/GD/VPL/9001.

DescriptionJU/GD/VPL/9001 has well preserved plates with broken roots. The anterior two and half plates of molar are broken out. The shape of the molar tapers at the posterior end (ovate); molar curvature is straight; inclination of plates to occlusal surface is weak;molar roots are strong and broken; enamel height above the cement is high; enamel figures are parallel sided with median loop,lateral sides of enamel are rounded and turn slightly anteriorly; the enamel are symmetrical in line with the long axis of the molar; medial edges of enamel of two middle plates are in contact, undulating folded; amplitudes of enamel folding in few plates are high to low; and space between enamel folds in few plates are tight to lose.The plates are well compact with cement and are widely spaced. The plates are slightly slanting towards posterior side.The specimen has four and a half worn plates and two unworn plates. The width of the molar increased from posterior to centre and then decreased slightly towards anterior side. Except the four and half worn plates, three plates have developed strong expansion of loops at the middle which are in connection with the adjacent ones. The enamel layer is quite simple and thick.

3 Comparative study of specimen JU/GD/VPL/9001 with allied species of Elephas

By using the dental morphological characters (number of plates, length of molar,height and width of crown,lamellar frequency, enamel thickness and hypsodonty index),the specimen JU/GD/VPL/9o01 under study is compared with allied species of Elephas ( $E$ namadicus, $E$ hysudricus,E.hysudrindicus,E.maximus,E.naumani,and $E$ ：planifrons)described earlier (Maglio,1973).The details of parameters described are given in Table 1.

Elephas namadicus differs from the JU/GD/VPL/9001 in number of plates (12-16), length of molar (223-317),width of crown (61-101), height of crown (137-218), enamel thickness (1.8-3.0) and hypsodonty index (135.6-298). The parallel lophs and absence of median expansion is very characteristic of $E$ 、namadicus which differentiate it from JU/GD/ VPL/9001.

Elephas hysudricus differs from JU/GD/VPL/9001 in number of plates (12-15),length of molar (235-302), width of molar (93-107), height of crown (108-137),lamellr frequency (3.9-6.5) and hypsodonty index (112.5-147.2). Lack of median expansion and strong plication of lophs is the characteristic of $E$ .hysudricus which is differentiated it from the JU/GD/ VPL/9001 (Ganjoo,1992).

Elephas hysudrindicus differs from JU/GD/VPL/9001 in number of plates (18-21), molar length (293.2-316.6),crown width (72.3-82.5),crown height (128.4-149.3),lamellar frequency (6.5),enamel thickness (2.6-2.7) and hypsodonty index (177.5-182.3). E. hysudrindicus is the most advanced member of Palaeoloxodon namadicus group.

Elephas maximus differs from JU/GD/VPL/9001 in number of plates (22-27),molar length (244-282), crown width (80-98), crown height (187-214),lamellar frequency (5-9), enamel thickness (2.5-3.0) and hypsodonty index (150-250).JU/GD/VPL/9001 has anterior and posterior columns along the median line (lenticular) which is absent in the $E$ maximus.

E. maximus has narrow folding enamel structure, whereas JU/GD/VPL/9001 has thick folded enamel structures.

The molar characters such as range of hypsodonty index,enamel thickness, lamellar frequency, height of crown, width of crown,length of molar and number of plates of Elephas naumani are 230-320, 2.0-3.2, 6-7,195-251,81-95,211-278 and 17-19 respectively, whereas the hypsodonty index,enamel thickness,lamellar frequency, height of crown,width of crown, length of molar and number of plates of JU/GD/VPL/9001 are 87,3.5,6,80,92,190 and9 respectively,which are different from $E$ naumani.

JU/GD/VPL/9001 specimen understudy is broad and brachydont with expanded strong anterior and posterior columns along the median line (lenticular) which are the characteristic features of the Elephas planifrons (Osborn,1942).The average enamel thickness of molar is 3.5 mm which precisely equals to the $E$ ：planifrons at the Indian Museum, Calcutta.The lamellar frequency of $E$ planifrons given by different authors is, Osborn (1942): up to 6; Hooijer (1955): up to 5; Maglio (1973): 2.6-5.5.

The lamellar frequency of molar under study is 6 and this specimen is also compared with the Elephas planifrons collected by Gupta (1981-1982) field session,from the Marikhui Member of Uttarbaini Formation which was published in GSI Catalogue No.5 (pictorial catalogue of Siwalik vertebrate fossls from NW Himalaya in the year, 2002 (pp.130, figure 1)). JU/GD/VPL/9001 is compared with the most primitive specimen (M3) of $E$ planifrons (number 19965,American Museum) collected by Barnum Brown from Upper Pliocene Pinjor horizon of the Siwalik near the Siswan, India.The specimen resembles with JU/GD/VPL/9001 in outline as well as dental characters such as plate numbers,enamel thickness,molar length, etc. JU/GD/VPL/9001 is also compared with the specimen No. WIF/A 423 (Nanda et al., 1991) which favours $E .$ planifrons.

Based on the above comparative studies of parameters such as plate number, lamellar frequency, hypsodonty index,straight molar curvature,greatest height of crown at posterior end, molar shape tapered at posterior end (ovate),thick cement on the sides and valleys, enamel highly crenulated, molar roots strong and broken, high enamel height above the cement, parallel sided with median loops expansion, rounded lateral sides of enamel and symmetrical in line with long axis of molar and discussion, JU/GD/VPL/900l shows close affinity to Elephas planifrons and tentatively referable as Elephas cf.E.planifrons.

# 4 Biozones/faunal interval zones

Various biostratigraphic interval zones of Siwalik Group of Pakistan have been recognized based on fauna and lithology and magnetostratigraphy by number of workers (Pilgrim,1913; Barry et al.,1982; Azzaroli,1985; Hussain et al.,1992). In India,Verma (1988) recognised two biozones based on his work in the Markanda valley of Himachal Pradesh. These biozones are Equussivalensis-Elephas hysudricus (EE) Biozone and Stegodon insignis

Hipparion theoboldi-Hexaprotodon sivalensis(SHH) Biozone.

The SHH biozone evidently corresponds to the Hexaprotodon sivalensis Interval Zone of Potwar Plateau (Pakistan) ranging from 5.3-2.9 Ma B.P. (Barry et al., 1982) and EE biozone corresponds to the Elephas planifrons Interval Zone ranging from $2 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 . 5 \mathrm { \ : M a \ : I }$ 3.P. and Pinjor Faunal Zone of the type area respectively. The SHH biozone is restricted to the Saketi Formation and exhibits a high frequency of aquatic forms in Himachal Pradesh and EE biozone is characterised by the presence of Equus,absence of Hipparion, presence of some aquatic forms and terminates at the end of Pinjor Formation.

The range of Elephas planifrons Interval Zone was modified by Hussain et al.(1992) from 2.9-1.5 to $3 . 4 { - } 2 . 7 \ \mathrm { M a }$ and also recognised a fifth zone known as Elephas hysudricus Range Zone $\left( 2 . 7 \mathrm { - } ? \mathrm { ~ M a } \right)$ .Later the upper limit of the $E$ hysudricus Range Zone was proposed by Nanda (1997) up to $0 . 6 \mathrm { M a }$ based on the fossils available in the Indian Siwalik.The lower limit of $E$ ： planifrons Interval Zone was modified by Agarwal et al.(1993) and was extended up to $3 . 6 ~ \mathrm { M a }$ based on dated $E$ ：planifrons. Nanda (1997) recognised two biostratigraphic interval zones of the Upper Siwalik Subgroup with their lower and upper limits as: 1) $E$ hysudricus Range Zone (contains most of taxa of Pinjor fauna), $2 . 6 { - } 0 . 6 ~ \mathrm { M a }$ ;2) $E$ planifrons Interval Zone (contains most of taxa of Tatrot fauna), $3 . 6 { - } 2 . 6 \mathrm { M a }$

Based on the presence of fauna in the Pabbi Hills of Upper Siwalik of Pakistan, Dannell et al. (2006) divided the Elephas hysudricus Range Zone of Hussain et al.(1992) into Elephas hysudricus-Crocuta-Ursus-Panthera faunal zone, $1 . 7 { - } 0 . 9 \ \mathrm { M a }$ ,and Elephas hysudricusSivatherium faunal zone, $2 . 7 \mathrm { - } 1 . 7 \mathrm { M a }$

As the Elephas cf. E. planifrons in the present study has been recovered from the mudstone horizon underlying geochronologically dated $( 2 . 4 8 ~ \mathrm { M a } )$ volcanic ash beds (Ranga Rao et al., 1988), the upper limit of range zone of Elephas planifrons may be extended from 2.6 (Nanda, 1997) to $2 . 4 8 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (proposed). The biostratigraphic interval and range zones of the elephant fauna by various authors and proposed range zone of Elephas planifrons are given in Fig. 3.

# 5 Conclusion

The recovery of Elephas cf. E. planifrons specimen from the mudstone underlying geochronologically dated $\left( 2 . 4 8 \ \mathrm { M a } \right)$ volcanic ash bed indicates that the age of the specimen is not younger than the volcanic ash beds exposed in the Upper Siwalik Subgroup of Samba districts.The upper limit of the Elephas cf.E.planifrons Interval Zone is also extended from 2.6 (Nanda,1997) to $2 . 4 8 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (proposed) in the present study as the specimen recovered from underlying geochronologically dated ash bed.

# Small mammal taphonomy of three Miocene localities from Damiao, Nei Mongol, China

Abstract Predation is the most common cause of death in small mammals.It also causes the greatest modification on their remains. Other postmortem processes,such as weathering, trampling,and transportation all modify bones and contribute to the forming assemblage.Here we examined three Miocene localities from Damiao,Nei Mongol, China with different fluvial subenvironments.The ages span from early Miocene to early late Miocene (ca.21-11.6 Ma).We describe the sedimentary context and taphonomic features of the small mammal assemblages, and identify the responsible agents for the fossil accumulations.Our study reveals predation as primary means of accumulation for all three localities.However,there is overprinting of other means of accumulation such as fluvial transportation and possibly signs of trampling at the two younger localities.Results indicate possibly different predators for all localities; owls for the oldest one,and diurnal birds of prey or mammalian agents for the younger two.We also show that systematic excavation for small mammals can be done,and in this way it may be possible to reduce some of the damage collecting always produces.

# 1 Introduction

Taphonomy, the study of preservational processes of organic remains,connects paleontology with biology and geology (Behrensmeyer et al., 20oo; Efremov, 1940). Taphonomic processes begin at the moment of death of an organism and continue till its recovery (e.g.,Arcos et al.,2010; Lyman, 1994). These processes are sources of bias in the fossil record since they may remove some of the biological information but on the other hand produce information of past environments and fossilization (Arcos et al.,201O; Behrensmeyer and Kidwell, 1985; Fernandez López, 1981,1991). Taphonomic processes affecting fossil assemblages include predation, scavenging, transport, and weathering (e.g.,Andrews,1990;

Andrews and Evans,1983;Behrensmeyer,1978; Lyman,1994) and they are portrayed by different taphonomic features such as breakage, intrusive corrosion, rounding, polishing, cracks,staining, scrapes, weathering, root marks, pressure damage,and enamel piting (Table 1).

Due to the limited life range of small mammals they are more sensitive to the local scale environmental changes than large mammals (Demirel et al.,2011; Redding, 1978; Soligo and Andrews, 2005) and therefore they are useful indicators of past ecologies (e.g.， Van Dam, 1997,2006; Van Dam and Weltje,1999).

One of the major causes of death of small mammals is predation (e.g.,Andrews,1990; Andrews and Evans,1983;Fernandez-Jalvo,1995;Reed and Denys,2011).Predation is also the cause of the greatest modification of small mammal remains (Andrews,1990). Of different predators, mammals modify the bones of their prey the most due to the usage of their shearing teeth in breaking up the prey before ingestion and due to this damage prey of mammalian predators is less likely to become fossilized (Andrews and Evans,1983).The least amount of bone breakage is produced by owls,while diurnal birds of prey are intermediate bone breakers (Andrews and Evans,1983;Andrews,1990).

Shortly after the death of a small mammal, secondary modifications of the remains takes place. These include decay, and scavenging, which are not easily recognized in fossil samples, for decay leaves little modification,and marks left by scavenging are not readily distinguished from modification by predation. Trampling is another source of modification beginning soon after death resulting in dispersal,breakage,burial or total destruction of the animal remains. (Andrews,1990; Arcos et al., 2010; Williams, 2001). Weathering occurs when bones are lying in the open without protection of some kind (Andrews,1990; Behrensmeyer,1978). However, small mammal remains are more likely to be trampled and broken or blown away than to remain exposed to weathering (Andrews,1990).

Transport of the remains often results in breakage of the bones.However, pellets and scat structures may protect bones for some time (Andrews,1990; Arcos et al.,2010),but when pellets disintegrate the skeletal material will be exposed to weathering and dispersal (Andrews, 1990; Korth,1979). Smal mammal remains are easily transported by flowing water (Andrews, 1990; Dodson,1973).

In this study we examine the small mammal taphonomy from three Miocene mammal localities from Damiao in Siziwang Banner, Nei Mongol (Fig. 1). The site was identified in 2006 and has been excavated in three field seasons since.These excavations have yielded over 30 fossil localities with three main fossil horizons that are magnetostratigraphically dated to range from early Miocene to earliest late Miocene (Kaakinen et al., 2015). Although numerous, the Neogene fossil mammal localities in Central Nei Mongol are scattered,lacking continuous vertical exposures and there are few representatives of early Miocene mammals (Kaakinen et al.,2015;Wang et al., 2009).In Damiao the strata constitute one of the most continuous sequences in Nei Mongol with early, middle,and late Miocene fossil faunas in stratigraphic superposition. Damiao also hosts the latest occurrence of the humid favouring pliopithecid primate in Central Asia,in the late middle Miocene locality of DMo1 (Zhang and Harrison, 2008). Out of the circa 30 localities,three rich localities of different age and sedimentology were chosen for closer inspection. The stratigraphy (Kaakinen et al., 2015) and some mammalian groups have been studied in detail (Wang and Zhang, 2O11; Zhang et al., 2011). This however is the first attempt to study the small mammal taphonomy from the area.

Here we report the results of a taphonomic study of small mammals found from three localities in Damiao.The aims of the study are to characterize the sedimentary context and taphonomic features of the small mammal burials,and to identify the agent(s) responsible for the fossil accumulations.This study also shows that systematic excavation for small mammals can be done and in this way it is possible to reduce some of the damage that always results from the collecting“no matter how careful the technique”(Andrews,1990).

# 2 Sedimentological and paleontological framework

The study area is located in central Nei Mongol, ca. $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ north from Hohhot, near Damiao village in Siziwang Banner (Fig.1). The area is distinguished by undulating topography ranging between $1 2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ and $1 3 5 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ a. s.l. The Damiao fossil localities are divided into eastern and western sides that are separated by the Wulanhua-Damiao motorway. All the localities in the area are only a few kilometers from each other. The sedimentary sequence is characterized as a fluvial environment where the bulk of the fine-grained deposits in the sequence represent well-drained floodplains (Kaakinen et al., 2015).

![](images/4765fa0b57e570a4f1e8ac75a8ae7a8254e9b2783639256510895f46efeb1f99.jpg)  
Fig.1Locations of the three studied localities at Damiao,Nei Mongol, China

DM16 is stratigraphically the lowest fossil site in Damiao and was paleomagnetically dated at $2 0 { - } 2 1 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (Kaakinen et al., 2015). It occurs within a mudstone interval comprising the basal $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m }$ of the sequence and extending laterally over hundreds of metres.The sediment succession at DM16 (Fig.2） comprises rather monotonous and homogenous redbrown claystone - fine siltstones that commonly exhibit massive weathering appearance. Thin flat lamination and graded beds $1 { \ - } 4 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ thick are recorded in the upper portion of the section. Slickensides, spherical mm-size manganese and calcium carbonate nodules occur throughout and are locally abundant. Some fine-scale alternation of red and green coloration is discernable in the lower portion of this interval.

The productive bed is ca. $1 . 2 \mathrm { m }$ thick,with one ca.9 cm thick fossil-rich horizon in the middle of the bed, and is associated with root traces and few desiccation cracks.The bonebed has yielded relatively well preserved but fragmented vertebrate fossil remains,comprising mainly small mammal skeletal elements; dipodid and eomyid rodents are common as well as ochotonid lagomorphs with few insectivores. Large mammals are scarcer and represented by artiodactyls,rhinos and a mustelid. Small mammals at this level are dominated by Oligocene genera, however,by more derived species.In addition to vertebrate remains, the locality contains a dense accumulation of fossil eggshell fragments,a few gastropod shell casts and several bone-bearing pellets in the richest horizon.

Laterally extensive, massive and finely-laminated mudstones that possess a variety of features indicating paleosol development are characteristic of floodplain deposits (Miall,

![](images/166615a7bae0e4700c2feed55672dd610c0d310a800f1a18b075f24733c89439.jpg)

1977,1992,1996). The sporadic desiccation cracks indicate that the mudstones were probably deposited as ephemeral ponds/lakes at the highest flood stage,and cracks were developed during desiccation (Miall,1977,1992).

The richest and only primate-bearing locality, DM01 is associated with latest middle Miocene Tunggur fauna with an age estimate of ca. $1 2 . 1 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (Kaakinen et al., 2015; Zhang et al.,2011, 2013). The DM01 section is dominated by two clast-supported conglomerate beds that stretch laterally over 6O meters.The well-sorted and densely packed clasts in these beds consist principally of spherical and well-rounded intraformational reworked calcium carbonate nodules up to $8 \mathrm { c m }$ in diameter. The lower unit is up to $6 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ thick and is composed of few-cm-thick beds that often show inverse grading from coarse sand to granules. The upper conglomerate shows variable bed thickness from $1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ to $1 . 6 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ and mainly consists of horizontally stratified pebble-granule conglomerate with subordinate layers of coarse sand and granules.In the sand-dominated parts the internal structures are trough and tabular cross bedding. The lower boundaries are erosive and exhibit discrete scours locally. These reworked pedogenic conglomerates show distinct rust and black colour in the outcrop; concretions have a black manganese staining and manganese and goethite highlights the bedding planes.

The sediments surrounding the conglomerates are mainly composed of well-sorted reddish yellow(7.5 YR 6/6) to light brown $( 7 . 5 \mathrm { \ Y R \ 6 / 4 } )$ fine sands and silts. The primary sedimentary structures, when present, include thin paralll lamination and cross-lamination. These sediments are often calcareous but calcareous nodules are scarce and continuous concretion horizons are absent.

The nodule conglomerates are interpreted as resulting from the avulsive emplacement of channels reworking and concentrating the underlying calcic paleosols (Kaakinen et al., 2015). The abundant occurrence of goethite and manganese indicate an impeded drainage and more humid conditions,although the reworked pedogenic nodules indicate that climate was seasonally dry (cf. Van Itterbeeck et al., 2007).

Fossils occur in the sand-granule interbeds throughout the upper nodule conglomerate.

In addition to the pliopithecid, more than 3O species and more than one thousand skeletal elements were found. While large mammals are few and fragmentary, small mammals are abundant and characterized by wel-preserved remains. Contrary to DM16 fauna, DMo1 fauna is composed of taxa from extant families lacking any Paleogene members.

DM02 locality represents early late Miocene with estimated age of ca. $1 1 . 6 \mathrm { M a }$ (Kaakinen et al.,2015; Zhang et al.,2011,2013). The DM02 section is predominately fine-grained (Fig.2). Lithologies are mixtures of reddish brown (5 YR 4/4) to yellowish red (5 YR 4/6) silt and clay with variable amounts of calcium carbonate accumulation as distinct nodules and indurated layers. Most units exhibit no internal bedding structures.DMO2 fossils are present in a 0.2-0.4 m thick lens-shaped sandstone body at the lowest portion of the local section. The fossiliferous unit erosionally overlies the underlying mudstone sequence and passes up with a sharp conformable contact to the overlying coarse siltstone.The sand lens is massive or displays a few centimeters thick horizontal interbeds of silt to poorly sorted coarse - very coarse sand. The constituent grains are mostly angular quartz, embedded in a silt matrix.

The fine-grained deposits that encompass the DM02 section are interpreted as pedogenically modified overbank deposits.Red coloration, carbonate nodules, pedogenic slikcensides and overall massive appearance in outcrop are all suggestive of pedogenesis. The fossil find unit, with its erosional base and heterogenous lithology, indicates sites of episodic injections of coarse sediment on the floodplain surface.Fossil fauna at DMo2 contains abundant and diverse fossls of rodents and lagomorphs, together with few specimens of large mammals (Kaakinen et al., 2O15). In general the fauna in DM02 is similar to DM01.

# 3 Material and methods

MaterialsFossil specimens under study were collected from Damiao during three field seasons between 2007-2009.Material from DM01 consists of 185 fossil specimens,both teeth and postcrania.From DM02 158 fossil specimens in total were analyzed, mainly teeth and a few jaw fragments. There was no postcranial material available for our study from DM02. Fossil material from DM16 consists of 360 specimens from the grid of which 255 specimens were taphonomically analyzed.Half of the analyzed specimens are with full grid reference (i.e. coordinate and depth information). Majority of DM16 material is postcrania with few teeth and jaws (Table 2).

MethodsAt the pliopithecid bearing locality of DMO1 as well as the adjacent DM02 a restricted area was opened and the sediments screened.A systematic sampling was carried out at the locality DM16,where a grid with 27 squares of $1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ } \times 1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in size was set up and collected fossils were given a specific grid reference as wellas for most collected specimens a precise location,both horizontal and vertical, within the grid. Dry-sieving of excavated material was done at the site using coarse screen.

The investigated specimens from Damiao showed a wide variety of taphonomic modification.In order to detect,measure,and score the surface alterations on fossil specimens, each element was carefully examined under a stereoscopic light microscope.Taphonomic features analyzed from Damiao material for this study were:breakage, intrusive corrosion, rounding,polishing,cracks,staining,scrapes, weathering, pressure damage,root marks,and surface (enamel) pitting (Fig. 3).

All the taphonomic features were scored on an ordinal scale of four stages of modification.The scale was developed for the purposes of this study based on Andrews’（1990)work on small mammal taphonomy. Scorings were made depending on the degree of the taphonomic modification

on the specimen.The four stages are as follows: $0 =$ no modification; $1 = { \mathrm { l i g h t } }$ modification; 2 $\mathbf { \Sigma } = \mathbf { \Sigma }$ moderate modification; and $3 =$ strong modification (Fig. 4).Additionally in order to detect the microfossil accumulating agent the ratio of major distal elements to proximal elements was calculated as well as the ratio of cranial elements to postcranial elements following Andrews (1990).

Voorhies’ Groups are a common way to examine skeletal elements according to their potentiality of being transported fluvially (Behrensmeyer, 1975; Lyman,1994; Voorhies, 1969).Degree of transport reflects the different settling velocities of different types of bones (Behrenesmeyer,1975; Korth,1979). Voorhies’Groups have been recalibrated for micromammal studies and the Generalized Sequence of Korth's settling groups (Korth,1979) was applied to the present data (Table 3).

# 4 Results and interpretation of taphonomic features

Proportions of taphonomic features on specimens at each locality are shown in Fig. 3, bones and dental materials separately. The most prominent feature is the lack of skulls at all localities as well as lack of postcranial material at DM02 (Table 2). The ratio of major distal limb elements to proximal elements for DM16 is higher than for DM01 (Fig. 5). The ratio of cranial element to postcranial is higher in DM0l than in DM16 (Fig. 6). Both teeth and bones from DM16 showed high incidence of breakage, intrusive corrosion, rounding, polishing, cracking,enamel piting and staining (Fig. 3), the taphonomic features that indicate predation (e.g., Andrews,1990; Andrews and Evans,1983; Fernandez-Jalvo, 1995;Reed and Denys,2011). The straight and spiral fracture types in broken bone specimens provide further evidence for predation (Shipman et al.,1981) as means of accumulation. Results from DM16 were also inspected with respect to the richest fossil layer. This level showed even more specimens with features associated with digestion (breakage, intrusive corrosion,and scrapes) than layers below or above it. Cracking was detected only from specimens from the richest fossil horizon and below it,and was more common in teeth than bones. Nevertheless,this feature was less common than other predation features and could result from other taphonomic agents than predation, for example from weathering during subaereal exposure of the remains. Weathering,in turn,is more common on bones than teeth but is altogether not a very common feature and can be separated from digestion by some unique features on the surface of the specimens.Weathering in small mammal remains can be identified from splitting that occurs along the collagen fiber orientation,flaking or exfoliation of the outer layer of bone (Fig. 4C) as well chipping and spliting of teeth (Andrews,1990). Of all the localities discoloured dental specimens were found only from DM16.

Theratios of anatomical elements further suggest that predation contributed to the accumulation of the small mammals in DM16. The ratio of distal (tibia $^ +$ radius) to proximal (femur $^ +$ humerus) limb elements is low (Fig. 5), indicating predator assemblage,as does the ratio of postcranial to cranial elements (Fig. 6). The absence of more distal parts of limbs is a common feature in predator assemblages as is

the deviation from the average skeletal proportions of postcranial to cranial elements,which indicates preferential destruction of a skeletal group - or selection against it (Andrews,1990) - in this case destruction of, or selection against, cranial elements.The lack of skulls is one main feature of trampled assemblages, although in small mammals evidence of natural trampling is nearly non-existent due to the fragile nature of their bones (Andrews,199O). Also the low number of isolated teeth at this locality suggests a source of modification of material other than trampling,such as fluvial transportation.

For DM16 bones of all of Korth's settling groups are present (Table 3). However, group I (most easily affected by fluvial transport) is rather poorly represented whilst there is a high representation of least easily transported group II elements (lag deposit). The loss of group I likely results from winnowing of lighter elements during surface runoff.

Less than half of DM16 fossil bones are weathered and when they are,they

mostly represent stage 1.This together with even less weathered dental material means that DM16 small mammal remains likely experienced only a short duration of exposure to weathering agents before burial. Taphonomic processes after burial in DM16 are represented by light pressure damage that is present in most specimens, and some rare light root marks. Intrusive corrosion found on specimens is likely digestive in origin as fossils are only partially affected by corrosion (Andrews,1990).

Both teeth and bone specimens from DMo1 showed high incidence of modifications related to predation (breakage,intrusive corrosion, rounding, polishing,enamel pitting and staining; e.g.,Andrews,1990; Andrews and Evans,1983; Fernandez-Jalvo,1995;Reed and Denys,2011). Also a high proportion of broken bones together with straight and spiral fracture types indicate predation as means of accumulation (Shipman et al., 1981). Bones from DM01 show highest incidence of stage 3 corrosion and dental material is mostly of stage 2.High incidence and high level of corrosion both on bone and dental material in DMOl suggest predation. However, the bimodal breakage distribution at DMO1 could indicate two different agents forcing the accumulation. Primary means of accumulation would be predation with overprinting of other processes like transportation or trampling. It is said that much of the breakage of bone assemblages is due to transport before or after burial and transportation of small mammal bones produces high levels of breakage (Andrews,199o). Trampling on the other hand is not well documented in small mammals since their bones are easily destroyed (Andrews,1990). However, the lack of skulls together with a high number of isolated teeth, proximal femora and distal humeri (Fig.7) is in accordance with the few observed trampled small mammal assemblages (Andrews,199o). The low ratios of distal to proximal limb elements and postcranial to cranial elements in DMol are characteristic features of many predator assemblages (Andrews,1990) (Figs.5,6).

The members of group I of Korth's settling groups in DM0l are absent (Table 3). This group is the one most easily affected by fluvial transport and might indicate DMOl is a lag assemblage (Behrenesmeyer,1975). However, DM01 has rather low representation of group II (lag assemblage) specimens as well,and this suggests that the assemblage has been affected by fluvial transport.

In DM0l more than half of the analyzed postcranial specimens showed signs of weathering, mainly stage 1. Dental material is less often weathered but more severely, mostly stage 2,indicating short duration of exposure,but longer than in DM16.Postdepositional modification in DM01 is represented by light pressure damage that is detected on most specimens as well as rare and light root marks. Intrusive corrosion in DMol did not affect whole surfaces and therefore is interpreted to be digestive in origin (Andrews,1990).

Locality DMO2 contains only small mammals and features only isolated teeth (Table 2).The dental material from DM02 presented the same taphonomic features of digestion that strongly indicate predation as for the previous unit DMo1 (Fig. 3).

Trampling cannot be fully excluded as a factor affecting the DMO2 small mammal fossil assemblage, since the lack of skulls may be associated with trampling (Andrews,1990). The total absence of postcrania may also be due to trampling, since trampling causes dispersal of bones (Andrews and Cook,1985)and in addition small mammal bones are fragile and easily broken when not protected by pellets (Andrews,1990).

The dental material at DMO2 is the least weathered of all studied localities,only $4 \%$ of teeth at DM02 showing light modification. The near lack of signs of weathering in DM02 indicates short duration of surface exposure prior to burial. After burial DMO2 dental material has experienced some pressure damage and root marks, however not severe. Intrusive corrosion is detected from all specimens but affecting only parts of the teeth suggesting digestive origins (Andrews,1990).

# 5 Discussion

The large lateral continuity of the DM16 sedimentary beds, their fine-grained lithologies and associated horizontally laminated structures indicate suspension setling in the distal floodplain with periodic input of fine sands. The small mammal remains represent larger grain sizes than the range represented in the sediment matrix and therefore are not likely to have experienced much fluvial transport to the site; the low representation of lighter elements is considered as resulting from winnowing during surface runof. Sedimentological evidence suggests that conditions were at least periodically oxidizing and conducive for soil formation as evidenced by carbonate nodules,root traces and occasional presence of mottling. The presence of bird eggshels indicates nesting sites and consequently substantiates the subaerial conditions.However, the fairly unweathered bone and teeth surfaces in DM16 do not suggest a prolonged period of subaerial exposure during dry seasons prior to burial.

The sedimentological data indicate that fossil bearing beds at DMOl resulted from reworking of the resistant pedogenic carbonate nodules into an intraformational conglomerate byfluvial avulsion. Some mechanical damage produced by transport is evident in the remains, although in light to moderate stages.It is also easily observed that DM01 shows element sorting by transport processes. The lack of skulls and high proportion of isolated teeth, distal humerus, distal tibia,and proximal ulna as well as fragmentary mandibles (cf. Wolff, 1973; Andrews,199o) all point to fluvial transportation as a means of accumulation (Fig. 7). Weathered specimens were more common at DM01 than at DM16 although their dominantly light to moderate stages do not indicate extended subaerial exposure. Therefore it is obvious that DMOl contains materials harvested from the floodplain but, based on the relatively wellpreserved nature of the remains, they have probably not been transported very long nor far.

The stratified bed of poorly sorted sand that typifies DMO2 suggests relatively highenergy injection of sediment to the floodplain. Taphonomical features at DMo2 locality are identical to DM01,except that the most prominent feature of DM02 is the total absence of skulls and postcranial elements. This may be due to transportation of all the lighter, more easily moved material away leaving only molars and a few mandibles behind, however, with total absence of postcrania this is uncertain.Another option could be trampling, which could have destroyed the fragile small mammal bones.However, due to the fragile nature of small mammal bones, natural trampling is rarely evidenced in small mammals (Andrews,1990).

Natural causes of death usually leave animals well preserved, with all parts of the skeleton unbroken and typically one or only a few species present at the bone accumulations (Andrews,1990). In the three discussed localities from Damiao this seems not to be the case.The fossils are fragmentary, with missing skeletal elements.While the identifications of specimens are uncertain and in some cases impossible due to the fragmentary nature of material, a variety of species of small mammals were present (Tables 4-6).

Small mammal (fossil) assemblages most often result from predation (e.g.,Andrews, 1990; Arcos et al., 2010; Fernandez-Jalvo,1995; Fernandez-Jalvo et al., 2016). Owls are commonly cited as a source for accumulations of small vertebrate fossils (Andrews,1990; Andrews and Evans,1983;Dodson and Wexlar, 1979), but there is rich evidence of various other predators like diurnal raptors and mammalian carnivores involved in the accumulation of small mammal vertebrate remains as well (Andrews and Evans,1983 and references therein). Predation seems to be a likely agent of accumulation for all localities in Damiao, however, there are differences in the intensities of digestion-associated features between localities (Fig.3),which might point to different predator species as dominant accumulation agents.Mammalian carnivores have a complete digestion and high levels of gastric acidity and therefore digestive corrosion (Andrews,1990). Nocturnal owls,in turn, have relatively low levels of acidity of gastric juices and corrosion whilst diurnal birds of prey feature intermediate acidity and corrosion of bone and dental remains. Signs of intrusive corrosion in Damiao specimens are very great for both bone and dental material in all three localities,being most severe in DM01 (Fig. 3)and least pronounced but abundant in DM16.DM02 molars exhibits similar distribution of corrosion stages as dental material in both DM0l and DM16.However, incisors and molars are known to have different response to digestion (Andrews,1990; Fernandez-Jalvo et al.,2016) and when excluding incisors,it is evident that DM02 and DM01 are more alike.The high incidence of intrusive corrosion could also be of pedogenic rather than digestive origin. However, the former should affect al parts of the bone rather than just small parts of it (Andrews,1990). Considering that the fossils from Damiao are partially affected by corrosion and show other abundant predation-related taphonomic features,corrosion seems more likely to be the result of digestion for these localities.

In addition to corrosion, indications of predation in Damiao localities is evidenced by several other taphonomic features.Nearly all of the dental material from the three localities showed signs of pitting. Breaking, rounding and staining of dental material were common features in DM01 or DM02 but less abundant in DM16.These taphonomic features on both dental specimens and bones indicate predation as an accumulating agent for all localities and possibly similar, more destructive predation for DMO1 and DMO2 than for DM16.

Relative proportions of skeletal elements may reveal the identity of the bone accumulator since all predators produce bone loss (Andrews,1990; Andrews and Evans,1983; Lyman, 1994). Mammalian predators produce the largest relative loss of distal limb parts,while the opposite occurs for owls. Diurnal raptors are set in between the two groups (Andrews, 1990; Lyman,1994). The relatively high proportion of distal limb elements and low ratio of cranial to postcranial material together with lightly digested elements suggest the involvement of owls in DM16.Several fossilized predator pellets at or right above the richest fossil layer further support this interpretation.Additionally,a few discoloured teeth indicate that diurnal raptors may have contributed to the formation of the assemblage (cf.Andrews,1990; Mayhew,1977). For DM0l,the relatively low proportion of distal limb elements and high ratio of cranial to postcranial material point to diurnal raptor or mammalian predator as possible producers of the assemblage even without the discoloration which may be concealed by strong manganese coloration. Significant alteration by digestive processes in nearly all elements could favour a mammalian predator origin.For DMO2 the teeth exhibit similar evidence of digestion as in DM01, perhaps suggesting the same predator implicated in the deposit formation.

At all localities some transportation of material is indicated, transportation of different duration for all localities and this results in selective loss and/or destruction of elements (e.g., Andrews,1990; Behrensmeyer,1975; Behrensmeyer et al.,2000; Korth,1979).However, the fluvial transportation has not been extensive for any of the localities as the taphonomy and preservational state of specimens suggest.

All field collecting methods may play an important role in bone modification and some damage is always done (Andrews,199o). In our study we conducted systematic excavation at DM16,and this material shows less severe stages of breakage compared to DM0l or DM02,both for bone and dental specimens.It seems likely that this method is slightly less destructive,but the differences are not statistically significant, preventing a definitive conclusion concerning the reason for breakage. The systematic sampling in DM16 did result in a clearly more representative set of specimens than DM0l (not to mention DM02) with more comprehensive representation of different skeletal elements (Table 2). However, it did not produce higher species diversity than at the two younger localities (Tables 4-6).

Large mammal fauna from Damiao has relatively stable pattern through time with cervoids as ruling group excluding the dominance of widespread open environment for the sequence (Kaakinen et al.,2O15). Indication of closed and humid environment for DM01 comes from the presence of the humid favouring pliopithecoid primate (Zhang and Harrison, 2008) as wellas anchitherine horse and the cervid Euprox alticus (Kaakinen et al., 2015; Wang and Zhang,2011). Sedimentological evidence also supports this with abundant goethite and manganese occurrence indicating more humid climate for DM1. However, the small mammal fauna in the entire sequence is dominated by rodents with only relatively few insectivores, which might indicate more dry and open environment (Klietmann et al., 2O15; Van den Hoek Ostende,20o1) than that inferred from the large mammals. Taphonomy and preservational state of the specimens suggest that small mammals were collected within the fluvial system, however, the primary accumulators were predators. Predators, however, often prey outside their living habitats affecting the faunal composition of the fossil accumulation and further paleoecological interpretations based on the exposed fauna (e.g., Fernandez-Jalvo et al., 2016) and therefore small mammals from Damiao may represent habitats of some distance away. Yet many small mammal predators, even if hunting outside their living/nesting habitats,are rarely foraging far but within few kilometers distance depending on the stage of the breeding cycle and season (e.g., Hardey et al., 2O09 and references therein). It can be hypothesized that all three localities were predator accumulations that encountered fluvial transportation to the final burial sites.Based on taphonomy, sedimentology and fauna the environment was likely predominantly closed with more open surrounding areas as a gallery forest with surrounding grassland. The youngest locality, DMO1,was likely the most humid.

# 6 Conclusions

The bone material in Damiao was mainly accumulated by predators and deposited in a fluvial seting. Some reworking by fluvial process took place in DM01 and DM02.DM16 represents distal part of the flood plain whereas DMOl portrays a channel-fill and DM02 is a result of an episodic flood discharge to the floodplain.

Accumulating predators were likely owls for DM16,and diurnal birds of prey for DM01 and DM02. However, mammals are not fuly excluded for contributing to DM01 fossil assemblage.

Systematic sampling of DM16 resulted in a wider range of skeletal material, however, it did not produce taxonomically richer sample than the more traditional excavation methods used at DM0l and DM02. Breakage was less pronounced in the systematic sample, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Environmental conditions for Damiao were rather stable throughout. It represents fluvial system,with mosaic grassland-forest environment (perhaps gallery forest with surrounding grassland). DM01, the only primate bearing locality, seems to have been the most humid, although seasonally dry.
