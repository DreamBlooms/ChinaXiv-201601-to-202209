Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by WRN protein deficiency. Here,we report on the generation of a human WS model in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Differentiation of WRN-nul ESCs to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) recapitulates features of premature cellular aging,a global loss of H3K9me3,and changes in heterochromatin architecture.We show that WRN associates with heterochromatin proteins SUV39H1 and HPlα and nuclear lamina-heterochromatin anchoring protein LAP2β.Targeted knock-inof catalytically inactive SUV39H1 in wild-type MSCs recapitulates accelerated cellular senescence,resembling WRN-deficient MSCs. Moreover, decrease in WRN and heterochromatin marks are detected in MSCs from older individuals. Our observations uncover a role for WRN in maintaining heterochromatin stability and highlight heterochromatin disorganization as a potential determinant of human aging.

domain (9).After two rounds of homologous recombination using helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAdV) $( l O , I I )$ ,we successfully generated homozygous WRN-null ESC lines $( \mathrm { E S C s  – } W R N ^ { - / - }$ ） (Fig.1,AandB,and fig.S1,Ato D).ESCs-WRN-/- expressed pluripotency markers,maintained normalkaryotype,and could differentiate into all three germlayers (Fig.1A and fig.S2,Ato E). ESCs-WRN-/-lacked detectable WRN protein,as determined by Western blot using antibodies specific to the N or C terminus of WRN (Fig.1B).No difference in cell cycle kinetics and cell growth rate between wild-type and WRN-null ESCs was observed (fig.S2,F to H).

WS patients are mainly characterized by prematureagingpathologiesassociated with degeneration of mesodermal tissues,i.e.,osteoporosis, atherosclerosis,and grayhair(1).Wehypothesized thatWS patientsmaysufferfroman accelerated exhaustion of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) pool.This was tested by differentiating ESCs$W R N ^ { - / - }$ into MSCs.MSCs-WRN-/- expressed MSCspecific cell surface markers CD73, CD9o, CD105; lacked expression of MSC-irrelevant antigens, including CD45,CD34,and CD43 (fig. S3A)；and

W erner syndrome (WS),also known as adult progeria, recapitulates certain aspects of human physiological aging (1).WS is caused by mutations in the WRN gene,resulting in loss of WRN expression or function $( I )$ 、WRNprotein plays roles in DNA replication,transcription,repair, and recombination,as well as telomere maintenance,indicating that one of themajor causes for WS pathogenesis relates to genomic instability (I,2).Epigenetic alterations have been associated with cellularaging in diverse model organisms (2-4).In humans,somatic cells derived frompatients with premature aging syndromes arecharacterizedbylossofheterochromatin marks (5-7).However,it is unclear whether epigenetic dysregulation is involved in WS pathogenesis.

Generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represents a promising avenue to model and study human aging and aging-associated disorders (8).WS-specific iPSC lines may constitute an ideal source for in vitro modeling of WS.However,we found that WS patient fibroblast lines deposited in different cell bankspresented severe karyotypicabnormalities andsecondaryDNAmutationsassociatedwith advanced stages of WS pathology.To create an unbiased human WS cellular model, we sought to generate an isogenic WS embryonic stem cell (ESC) line by knocking out exons 15 and 16 of the WRN gene encoding the conserved DNAhelicase could differentiate into osteoblasts,chondrocytes, and adipocytes (fig.S3,B and C) (12).

Uponserial passaging,WRN-deficient MSCs recapitulated major phenotypes of premature aging, including premature loss of proliferative potential,increased number of senescence-associated- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \{ \vec { \tau } \beta \cdot \vec { \tau } \beta \cdot \vec { \tau } \beta \cdot \vec { \tau } \beta \cdot \vec { \tau } \beta \cdot \vec { \tau } \beta \cdot \vec { \tau } } $ galactosidase (SA- $\cdot \beta$ -gal)-positive cells,up-regulated expression of aging-associated genes $\mathrm { { p 1 6 } ^ { \mathrm { { I n k 4 a } } } }$ and $\mathrm { \ p 2 1 } ^ { \mathrm { W a f 1 } }$ ,and activation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (Fig.1, C to E,and fig. S3,D to G) (I3).Moreover, when WRN-deficient MSCs expressing luciferase were transplanted into the muscle of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/sCID) mice, they underwent an accelerated attrition compared to wild-type MSCs (Fig.1F and fig. S3H).These results demonstrated that the loss of WRN promotes premature senescence in MSCs.

WRNdeficiencyinMSCsresultedinelevated DNA damage response (DDR),indicated by increased nuclear foci for 53BP1, $\gamma$ -H2AX,and phosphorylatedATM/ATR substrates (fig.S4,A to C). Restoration ofWRNactivityby lentivirus-mediated expression in MSCs- $W R N ^ { - / - }$ resulted in partial alleviation of DDR and cellular senescence (fig. S4, D and E).To investigate potential chromosomal abnormalities resulting from the loss of WRN protein,we performed genome-wide copynumber variation (CNV)analysisbydeep sequencing.In the time frame examined, genomic integrity was minimally affected in MSCs- $W R N ^ { - / - }$ (fig. S4F).

Epigenetic alteration has been considered asa hallmark of aging (2).MSCs- $W R N ^ { - / - }$ showed a distinct nuclear Hoechst 33342 staining pattern withmarkedly enlarged nucleiandahigh pixel-topixel coeficient of variation (CV) value,indicating possible changes in chromatin structure(Fig.2A and fig. S5A).Moreover, WRN-deficient MSCs exhibitedaccelerated diminishment of heterochromatinassociated inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins $\mathrm { L A P 2 \beta }$ andLBR and reducedheterochromatin structure underneath the nuclear envelope,as indicated by immunostaining and electron microscopy (Fig.2Band fig.S5,B and C) (14).These results suggest a progressive disorganization of heterochromatinin WRN-deficientMSCs.

Further investigation of heterochromatin reorganizationat histone andDNAlevelsrevealed marked down-regulation of the constitutive heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 (trimethylated histone H3 at lysine-9)in $\mathbf { M S C - } W R N ^ { - / - }$ (Fig. 2C and fig.S5,D and E).In contrast,H3K27me3 showed slight down-regulation,whereasH3K4me3,amark for euchromatin fiber, exhibited comparable levels between WRN-deficient and wild-type MSCs (Fig. 2C and fig.S5,Dand E).We did not observe obvious genome-wide alteration of 5-methylcytosine (5mC)in WRN-deficient MSCs(Fig.2C).Bioinformatic analysis identified 73 H3K9me3- enriched“mountains"throughout the genome in MSCs- $W R N ^ { + / + }$ ,which are characterized by $> 2 0 \ \mathrm { k b }$ of consecutive peaks of H3K9me3 (Fig. 2D).Of these H3K9me3 mountains,28 $( 3 8 \% )$ （204号 were lost in MSCs $. W R N ^ { - / - }$ (Fig.2D).Interestingly, 24 $8 6 \%$ ofthese impairedH3K9me3mountains resided in subtelomeric or subcentromeric regions (Fig.2,D and E,and table S1).

RNA sequencing(RNA-seq) identified 1047 RefSeq genes that showed differential expression in MSCs-WRN-/- (fig.S6,A and B,and table S2). The most obviously down-regulated genes were centromere-packaging proteins and components of the nuclear membrane (fig.S6,A to E,and table S3).These results indicatealterations in nuclear structure and epigenomic organization, potentially leading to a progressive loss of heterochromatin structure inMSCs as a consequence of WRN depletion.

Inagreement with previous reports describing WRN as a telomere-associated protein required fortelomere maintenance (i5),compromised telomeraseactivityandshortertelomerelengthwere detected in MSC-WRN-/- (fig.S7,Aand B).In addition,chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-QPCR) showed binding ofWRNto theH3K9me3-enriched centromeric loci $\mathsf { \Gamma } _ { \mathrm { ~ \tiny ~ Q ~ } }$ -Satellite( $\mathit { \Pi } _ { \mathrm { ( \mathfrak { A } _ { \mathrm { } } } } ^ { \prime } \mathit { \Pi } _ { \mathrm { ( \mathfrak { A } _ { \mathrm { } } } } ^ { \prime }$ -Sat）andSatellite 2 (Sat2) (Fig.3A) (16).Depletion of WRN resulted in an increase in centromeric $\gamma$ -H2AXsignaland a loss of H3K9me3 from $\alpha$ -Sat and Sat2 loci accompaniedbyup-regulation of transcripts from these sequences (Fig.3,A and B,and fig. S7C). Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP)analysis revealed WRN as part of a complexcontaining the major histonemethyltransferase forH3K9me3-SUV39H1, HPlα,and LAP2β,a nuclear envelope component that recruits heterochromatin via anchoring to HPlα (Fig.3C and fig. S7D) (17).These observations suggest a role for WRN, together with SUV39H1 andHPlα,in the stabilization of heterochromatin.

We next tested whether disorganization of heterochromatin could contribute to accelerated cellular senescence.Knockdown of SUV39H1 or HPlα in wild-type MSCs led to a reduction of overall H3K9me3 and induction of cellular senescence,asassayedbyWesternblot,SA $\cdot \beta$ -gal staining,and pl6 expression (Fig.3D and fig. S8, A to D). On the contrary, overexpression ofHPlα up-regulatedH3K9me3levels and repressed cellular senescence in WRN-deficient MSCs (fig. S8,E to H).To confirm these observations,we mountain"distribution over 23 chromosomes.The blue lines indicate 73 “H3K9me3 mountains" present in $_ { \mathsf { M S C S - W R N } ^ { + / + } }$ ，whereas48 $( 6 5 . 8 \% )$ of themare localized within 5 Mb regions around the telomeres or centromeres.

generated pluripotent ESCs-SUV39HiH324K lines harboring catalytically inactivated endogenous SUV39H1(fig.S9,A to D).Upon differentiation, MSCs-SUV39H1H324K displayed drastic nuclear structural and chromosomal changes,loss of INM proteinsLAP2β andLBR,decreased levels of H3K9me3 and HPlα,up-regulation of centromeric repetitive sequence transcription,and coordinated transcriptional down-regulation of centromere-packaging components (Fig.4,A to C,and fig.S10,A and B).MSCs-SUV392re capitulated premature aging phenotypes observed inWRN-deficientMSCs,includingretarded cell growth and accelerated cellular senescence determinedby SA $\cdot \beta$ -gal staining (Fig.4D and fig. S10, C to E).High expression of SUV39H2,a germlinespecific histone methyltransferase,and/or other factorsmayfunctionally compensateforSUV39H1 deficiency in ESCs (fig. S1oF) (18,I9),where upon inactivation of the WRN-SUV39H1 axis,no discernible heterochromatin change was observed (figs.SioG and S8A).It should be noted that MSCs-SUV39H1H324K exhibit neither increased $\gamma$ -H2AX $\langle { P = 0 . 7 7 3 } \rangle { }$ and phosphorylatedATM/ATR substrates $( P = 0 . 2 7 9 ^ { \cdot }$ ,nor telomere attrition (figs. S10H and S7,Aand B).These results indicate that heterochromatin destabilization promotes premature aging in MSCs.

Finally,we asked whetherheterochromatin disorganization could be a common hallmark for physiological human stem cell aging.For this purpose,we compared the levels of heterochromatin marksin primary dental pulp MsCs derived from six young(7- to 26-year-old) and six old (58- to 72- year-old) individuals (fig.SioI and table S4) (20). A marked down-regulation of WRN protein associated with a decrease inH3K9me3,HPlα, SUV39Hl, and $\mathrm { L A P 2 \beta }$ levelsin MSCs derived from old individuals (Fig.4E).Therefore,specific heterochromatin changes may underlie both pathological and physiological MSC aging.

In summary,we have found that WRN protein,besides its role in DNA repair,functions tosafeguardheterochromatin stability (fig. S11). Our results reveal that the progressive heterochromatin disorganization observed in WRNdeficient MSCs underlies cellular aging,but more extensive studies are needed to examine its role during physiological aging. The methodologies and observations introduced here maybeused and extendedtowardthesystematic study of other age-associated molecular events with relevance to human aging and age-related disorders.
