# ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the onset time of solar energetic particle (SEP)events with numerical simulations and analyzes the accuracy of the velocity dispersion analysis （VDA）method.Using a three-dimensional focused transport model,we calculate the fluxes of protons observed in the ecliptic at1AU in the energy range between $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ and $8 0 \mathrm { M e V . }$ In particular,three models are used to describe different SEP sources produced by flare or coronal shock,and the eects of particle perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space are also studied. We have the following findings.When the observer is disconnected from the source,the effects of perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space and particles propagating in the solar atmosphere have asignificant influence on the VDA results.As aresult,although the VDA method is valid with impulsive source duration,low background, and weak scattering inthe interplanetary space or fast diffsion in the solar atmosphere,the method is not valid with gradual source duration, high background, or strong scattering.

# 1.INTRODUCTION

Solar energetic particles(SEPs）were first reported by Forbush (1946).Because coronal mass ejection (CME) was not discovered at that time,SEPs were assumed to be accelerated bysolar flares.If this holds true,it is reasonable to assume that the size of the SEPs source is close to that of the flare.However, some SEP events could be simultaneously observed by multiplespacecraft with a very wide spatial distribution that could be much wider than the size of the flare.In order to interpret this phenomenon,two scenarios were proposed:（1） particles can cross magnetic field lines in the interplanetary space with perpendicular diffusion (McKibben 1972;Dresing et al. 2012, 2014),and (2) particles can propagate in the solar atmosphere (Wibberenz et al. 1989; Dresing et al. 2014). However, the SEP community later realized that CMEs are important for particle acceleration, especiallyinlarge SEP events(Mason etal.1984; Gosling 1993;Zank et al. 2000; Li et al. 2003). As a result besides the former two scenarios,a third one was proposed: the wide spread of SEPs can be explained by SEPs being accelerated bylarge-scale shocks.However,large SEP events are usually associated with both flares and CMEs,so the role of flares and shock in the acceleration process of SEPs is still being debated. For the historical development of the studies on the source of SEPs,please refer to the review articlesbyReames(1999) and Reames (2013).

Because of the effects of particle transport, it is difficult to distinguish between the signatures of different accelerators inSEPfluxes at1AU.However,SEPfluxesobserved in the interplanetary space show a velocity dispersion at the onset time. The velocity dispersion analysis（VDA） method has been used widely to investigate SEP acceleration and transport processes (Krucker et al. 1999; Krucker & Lin 2000; Kahler & Ragot 2006; Reames 2009; Tan et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013; Ding et al. 2014). This method assumes that the first-arriving particles move along the magnetic field lines,and the path length traveled byparticles between the source and observer is independent of energy.With these assumptions,the SEP release time near the Sun and the interplanetary path length can be determined by using the onset times of different energy particles.In addition, to compare the SEP release time with the electromagnetic signature of the SEP source,the SEP source can be identified.

It has been known for along time that when an observer is far from the magnetic connection point of the source on the Sun, the onset time of the SEP flux showsa delay(Van Hollebeke et al. 1975;Ma Sung & Earl1978).This would lead to changes in the resultsof the VDA method.Krucker etal.(1999) calculated the release time near the Sun and the path length in the interplanetary space of SEPs with 12 short electron events observed by the Wind spacecraft.The result of the VDA method indicates two kinds of electron events.In the first kind of event, the electron release time is extremely close to the onset of a radio type III burst when the observer is connected to the flare.In the second kind of event, the electrons are released much later (e.g.,half an hour) than the onset of the type II burst when the observer is disconnected from the flare.Huttunen-Heikinmaa etal.(2005) studied the release time of $\mathbf { M e V / n }$ protons and heliums observedby Solar and Heliospheric Observatory $( S O H O ) / \mathrm { E R N E }$ TheyfoundthatthedelayinSEPreleasetimederivedfrom the VDA method is related to the poor magnetic connection between the flare site and the spacecraft.For extremely high energy particle events,Reames (2OO9） studied the onset time of ion fluxes in ground-level enhancements. They concluded that the time difference between the solar particle release time and the onset time of the metric type II radio burst increases with the angular distance between the observer's magnetic foot-point and the source increase.

According to different heliographic latitude observations, Zhang et al. (2OO3） analyzed an SEP event simultaneously observed by the Ulysses and $G O E S$ spacecraft. The GOES spacecraft is located in the ecliptic,and the Ulysses is located at $6 2 ^ { \circ }$ south. The SEP release time derived from the $G O E S$ data is consistent with the onset of the soft X-ray flux,and the path length is also close to the Parker spiral. In contrast, the release time derived from the Ulysses datais three hours later than the onset of the soft $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { X }$ -ray flux,and the path length is much longer than the Parker spiral.Further studies were done by Dalla et al. (2003a, 2OO3b)，who analyzed nine SEP events observed by

Ulyssesathigh latitudes,among which eight events are observed at latitudes of more than $6 0 ^ { \circ }$ ,and the remaining event is observed at 47:9 latitude.Dalla et al.(2003a,2003b) found that the pathlengths derived from the Ulysses data are 1.O6-2.45 times the length of the Parker spiral,and the particle release times arebetween 1OO and 35O minutes later than that derived from the SOHO and Wind measurements.The delay in particle release timeincreaseswiththe latitudinal difference $\Delta \theta$ between the spacecraft and the flare.Based on the delay of particle release time derived from in-ecliptic measurements relative to that from high-latitude measurements,we can conclude that such a delay is related to the poor connection between the source and spacecraft.

In order to use the VDA method more reasonably,many studies have been done to investigate the validity of the method. The following are their main conclusions.First,when the parallel mean-free path (MFP) is large enough $( \lambda _ { \parallel } > 0 . 3 \mathrm { A U } )$ ， interplanetary scattering has only a small effect on the derived solarrelease time(Kallenrode&Wibberenz199O;Lintunen & Vainio 20O4;Diaz etal.2O11). Second,when the background level is below $0 . 0 1 \%$ of the peak intensity of the flux, the onset time of the SEP event can be determined quite accurately (Saiz et al.2OO5).In the above works,the interplanetary scattering and background-level effects on the release time have been studied in detail.In this paper, we study how different source models and perpendicular diffusion affect the onset time of the SEP and VDA results.In Section 2 we describe the SEP transport model. In Section 3 we show the simulation results.In Section 4 we discuss and summarize our results.

# 2.MODEL

We model the transport of SEPs following the previous research (e.g., Qin et al. 2006, 2013; Zhang et al. 2009; Droge et al. 2010; He et al. 2011; Zuo et al. 2011, 2013; Wang et al. 2012,2O14).A three-dimensional focused transport equation is written as (Skilling 1971; Schlickeiser 2002;Qin et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2009)

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \displaystyle \frac { \partial f } { \partial t } = \nabla \cdot ( \boldsymbol { \kappa } _ { \perp } \cdot \nabla f ) - \left( v \mu \hat { \boldsymbol { b } } + V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } \right) \cdot \nabla f + \frac { \partial } { \partial \mu } \left( D _ { \mu \mu } \frac { \partial f } { \partial \mu } \right) } \\ & { \quad + p \left[ \frac { 1 - \mu ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \left( \nabla \cdot V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } - \hat { \boldsymbol { b } } \hat { \boldsymbol { b } } : \nabla V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } \right) + \mu ^ { 2 } \hat { \boldsymbol { b } } \hat { \boldsymbol { b } } : \nabla V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } \right] \frac { \partial f } { \partial p } } \\ & { \quad - \frac { 1 - \mu ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \left[ - \frac { v } { L } + \mu \left( \nabla \cdot V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } - 3 \hat { \boldsymbol { b } } \hat { \boldsymbol { b } } : \nabla V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } \right) \right] \frac { \partial f } { \partial \mu } , \qquad ( 1 } \end{array}
$$

where $f ( { \pmb x } , { \pmb \mu } , p , t )$ is the gyrophase-averaged distribution function; $\boldsymbol { x }$ is the position in a nonrotating heliographic coordinate system; $p , \mu$ ，and $\boldsymbol { v }$ are the momentum,particle pitch-angle cosine,and speed, respectively,in the solar wind frame; $t$ is the time; $V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } = V ^ { \mathrm { s w } } { \hat { r } }$ is the solar wind velocity; $\hat { \pmb { b } }$ is a unit vector along the local magnetic field; and $L$ is the magnetic focusing length given by $L = ( \hat { \pmb { b } } \cdot \nabla l n B _ { 0 } ) ^ { - 1 }$ with $B _ { 0 }$ being the magnitude of the background magnetic field. This equation includes many important particle transport effects,such as particle streaming along the field line, magnetic focusing in the diverging interplanetary magnetic field (IMF),adiabatic cooling in the expanding solar wind,and the diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the IMF.Here,we use the Parker field model for the IMF,and the solar wind speed is $4 0 0 \mathrm { k m s ^ { - 1 } }$ ：

The relationship between $D _ { \mu \mu }$ and parallel MFP $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is written as (Jokipii 1966;Hasselmann 1968; Earl 1974)

$$
\lambda _ { \parallel } = \frac { 3 \upsilon } { 8 } \int _ { - 1 } ^ { + 1 } \frac { ( 1 - \mu ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } } { D _ { \mu \mu } } d \mu ,
$$

and the parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa _ { \| }$ can be written as $\kappa _ { \parallel } = v \lambda _ { \parallel } / 3$

We follow the model for the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient from Beeck & Wibberenz(1986),see also (Qin et al. 2005)

$$
D _ { \mu \mu } = D _ { 0 } \upsilon p ^ { q - 2 } \{ | \mu | ^ { q - 1 } + h \} ( 1 - \mu ^ { 2 } ) ,
$$

where the constant $D _ { 0 }$ controls the magnetic field fluctuation level. The constant $q$ is chosen as $5 / 3$ for a Kolmogorov spectrum type of the power spectral density of magnetic field turbulence in the inertial range.Furthermore, $h = 0 . 0 1$ is chosen for the nonlinear effect of pitch-angle diffusion at $\mu = 0$ in the solar wind (Qin & Shalchi 2009,2014).

The relation of the particle momentum and the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is set as

$$
\kappa _ { \perp } = \kappa _ { 0 } \Big ( \frac { p } { 1 \mathrm { G e V } c ^ { - 1 } } \Big ) ^ { 1 / 3 } \Big ( I - \hat { b } \hat { b } \Big ) ,
$$

where $p$ is the particle momentum.Different perpendicular diffusion coefficients could be obtained by altering $\kappa _ { 0 }$ ，and $\kappa _ { \perp } / \kappa _ { \parallel }$ is set to O.O1 in the ecliptic at 1AU in our simulations. Note that we use this formula for the purpose of simplicity. There are some more complete models that are developed to describe the particle diffusion in magnetic turbulence,such as the nonlinear guiding center theory (Matthaeus et al. 2O03; Qin & Zhang 2014).

We use boundary values to model the particle injection from the source,which is chosen in the following form:

$$
f _ { b } ( z \leqslant 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { A U } , E _ { k } , \theta , \varphi , t ) = a \frac { E _ { k } ^ { - \gamma } } { p ^ { 2 } } \xi \left( t , \theta , \varphi \right) ,
$$

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \xi ( t , \theta , \varphi ) } \\ & { = \{ \begin{array} { l l } { \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { t } \exp [ - \frac { t _ { c } } { t } ( \frac { \phi _ { \varepsilon } } { \phi _ { 0 } } ) ^ { 2 } - \frac { t } { t _ { i } } ] H ( \phi _ { s } - | \phi ( \theta , \varphi ) | ) } & { \mathrm { C a s e ~ 1 , } } \\ { \displaystyle \{ \frac { 1 } { t } \exp [ - \frac { t _ { c } } { t } ( \frac { \phi _ { s } } { \phi _ { 0 } } ) ^ { 2 } - \frac { t } { t _ { i } } ] H ( \phi _ { s } - | \phi ( \theta , \varphi ) | ) } & \\ { \displaystyle + \frac { 1 } { t } \exp [ - \frac { t _ { c } } { t } ( \frac { \phi ( \theta , \varphi ) } { \phi _ { 0 } } ) ^ { 2 } - \frac { t } { t _ { i } } ] [ 1 - H ( \phi _ { s } - | \phi ( \theta , \varphi ) | ) ] } & { \mathrm { C a s e ~ 2 , } } \end{array}  } \\ & { \quad \quad \quad \quad \frac { 1 } { t } \exp ( - \frac { t _ { c } } { t } - \frac { t } { t _ { i } } ) \exp ( - \frac { | \phi ( \theta , \varphi ) | } { \phi _ { 0 } } ) H ( \phi _ { s } - | \phi ( \theta , \varphi ) | ) \quad \mathrm { ~ C a s e ~ 3 . } } \end{array}
$$

Here the particles are injected from the SEP source near the Sun, and $\phi ( \theta , \varphi )$ is the angle between the source center and any point $( \theta , \varphi )$ near the Sun where the particles are injected.We use three models to describe different scenarios.In case 1, SEPs are accelerated by a flare,and particles do not propagate in the solaratmosphere.Incase 2,SEPs are accelerated bya flare,and particles can propagate in the solar atmosphere.In case 3, SEPs are accelerated by a coronal shock.The flare source model in case1 and 2 is obtained by following Reid(1964),and the shock model incase 3 is obtained followingKallenrode&Wibberenz (1997). Here, $H ( x )$ is the Heaviside step function; $\phi _ { s }$ is used to control the angular width of the source; $\phi _ { 0 }$ describes how the source intensity decreases toward the flank of the source,and it is set to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ in the following simulations unless otherwise stated in the text; $E _ { k }$ is the energy of the particles; $\gamma$ is the spectral index of the source particles;and $t _ { c }$ and $t _ { l }$ are time constants to indicate the rise and decay timescales,respectively.Here, we set a typical value of $\gamma = 3$ for the spectral index of the source particles.Figure 1(a) shows spatial distributions of flux at $t = 0 . 0 2$ day normalized by the peaks in the cases of the different source models (cases 1-3).Here,the parameters of source duration are set to $t _ { c } = 0 . 0 2$ day and $t _ { l } = 0 . 0 5$ day, and $\phi _ { s }$ is set to different values corresponding to different source models.Figure 1(b) shows time profiles of the flux at $\phi = 0 ^ { \circ }$ normalized by the peaks in the cases of different source duration. In our simulations,the source rotates with the rotation of the Sun.

Figure 1.Comparison of proton fluxes with different source models and source durations

We use a time-backward Markov stochastic process method to solve the transport Equation(1) (Zhang 1999). The initial boundary value problem of the SEP transport equation can be reformulated into stochastic differential equations,so it can be solved by a Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov stochastic process,and the SEP distribution function can be derived.In this method,we trace particles from the observation point back to the injection time from the SEP source.Only those particles in the source region at the initial time contribute to the statistics. Fora detailed description of this method,please refer to Qin et al. (2006).

# 3.RESULTS

Note that the inner boundary is $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { A U }$ ，and the outer boundary is 5O AU.We use two different parallel MFPs $\lambda _ { \parallel } =$ 0.126 AU and $\lambda _ { \parallel } = 0 . 3$ AU for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons in the ecliptic at1AU.Based on the simulation results of Diaz et al. (2011), interplanetary scattering has a great effect on the derived solar release time of the VDA method in the case of $\lambda _ { \parallel } = 0 . 1 2 6 \mathrm { A U }$ and it has only a small effect on the derived solar release time in the case of $\lambda _ { \parallel } = 0 . 3$ AU.As a result, $\lambda _ { \parallel } = 0 . 1 2 6$ AU is used as strong scattering in the interplanetary space,and $\lambda _ { \parallel } = 0 . 3 \mathrm { A U }$ is used as weak scattering.In the following simulations, $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to 0.126 AU for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ particles in the ecliptic at 1AU, unless otherwise stated in the text.We choose different $t _ { c }$ and $t _ { l }$ to study different durations of the source.We set $t _ { c } = 0 . 0 2$ day $( 0 . 4 8 \mathrm { h r } )$ and $t _ { l } = 0 . 0 5$ day $( 1 . 2 \mathrm { h r } )$ as an impulsive duration and set $t _ { c } = 0 . 1$ day $( 2 . 4 \ \mathrm { h r } )$ and $t _ { l } = 0 . 2 5$ day $( 6 \ \mathrm { h r } )$ as a gradual duration case.

Before we can determine the detected onset time from the simulated time profiles,we have to define the background level of the flux.In a real SEP event, this background may be due either to the level of galactic cosmic rays or to a previous SEP event.In this paper,we choose the background level asa constant fraction $A$ of the maximum intensity. In each energy channel, we set the background fraction $A$ as $1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ ， $1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ ，and $1 0 ^ { - 1 }$ corresponding to a low background level,middle background level,and high background level, respectively.

# 3.1.ParticlesNotPropagating in the Solar Atmosphere

In this section,we use the source model as shown in case 1 ofEquation (5),i.e.,particles are accelerated by a flare without propagating in the solar atmosphere.In addition, $\phi _ { s }$ is set to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$

# 3.1.1.Effect of Perpendicular Diffusion on the Onset TimeofanSEPEvent

Figure 2(a) shows time profiles of a $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ proton omnidirectional flux in the cases with and without perpendicular diffusion. The source duration is set as a gradual one,i.e., $t _ { c } = 0 . 1$ day and $t _ { l } = 0 . 2 5$ dayas a gradual duration. The solid line indicates the case with perpendicular diffusion,and the dash-dotted line indicates the case without perpendicular diffusion.The observer is located in the ecliptic at1AU and $0 ^ { \circ }$ longitude,and the observer'sfieldline isconnected directlyto the centerof the source near the Sun. Comparing the time profiles of the flux, we find that the observed flux is smaller with the perpendicular diffusion.The reason is that, in this situation, the particles can leave field lines because of perpendicular diffusion.Figure 2(b) shows the time profiles of the flux normalized by the peaks As one can see, the onset times are much the same with and without perpendicular diffusion,so the two cases could not be distinguished observationally.We also show the normalized flux to study the onset time in the following cases.

# 3.1.2.Observers atDifferentLocations

Figure 3(a) shows time profiles of a $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ proton omnidirectional fluxdetected bythree observers.The source duration is setas a gradual one.The observersare located in the ecliptic with different longitudes such that the center of the source is located at $0 ^ { \circ }$ ， $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ west,and $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ east of the foot-point of the observer, whicharelabeledas $0 ^ { \circ }$ (solid line), $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ (dash-dotted line), and $E 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ (dashed line), respectively.When an observer is connected to the center of the source directly by the IMF, energetic particles can arrive at the observers location by following the field lines.In the cases of $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $E 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ ,the two observers' field lines are disconnected from the SEP source because the half-width of the source is only $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ . Therefore, energetic particlescan onlybe detectedbytheobserverswiththeeffect of perpendicular diffusion during the onset time.According to the above three observers,the peak of the flux is the largest when the observer is connected directly to the source by the IMF,and it is the smallest when the the center of the source is located at $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ west of the IMF foot-point of the observer.Because of the effect of convection, the particles rotate with the Sun after they are emitted.More particles are injected into the field line of the observer if the source is located at $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ east than that at $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ west.As a result,the flux of $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ is smaller than that of $E 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ . This effect would lead to the eastwest asymmetry of the SEP distribution in the interplanetary space.Figure 3(b) shows time profiles of a normalized omnidirectional flux for the cases in Figure 3(a).According to the observers, the onset time is the earliest when the observeris connected to the source,and it is thelatestwhen the center of the source is located at $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ east of the IMF foot-point of the observer.

# 3.2.Different Source and Transport Models

Figure 4 shows time profiles of the $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ proton normalized omnidirectional flux in the cases with different source models. The solid line indicates that particles do not propagate in the solar atmosphere with case 1 of Equation（5) $( \phi _ { s } = 1 5 ^ { \circ } )$ .The dashed line indicates that particles can propagate in the solar atmosphere with case 2 of Equation (5) $( \phi _ { s } = 1 5 ^ { \circ } )$ ). The dashdotted line indicates that particles are accelerated by a coronal shock with case 3 of Equation (5) $( \phi _ { s } = 6 0 ^ { \circ } \$ ).Inall three cases, the observer is located in the ecliptic at1 AU and is connected to the center of the source.The time profiles are similar during the rising phase in all cases.As a result,when the observer is connected to the center of the source, the spatial distribution of the source does not affect the VDA results.

Figure 5 shows time profiles of a $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ proton omnidirectional flux in the cases with different propagation models.In all cases,the observer is located in the ecliptic at 1AU,and the center of the SEP source is ${ \mathrm { E } } 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ to the observer with $\phi _ { s } = 1 5 ^ { \circ }$ The source parameter $\phi _ { 0 }$ is set to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $5 ^ { \circ }$ in Figures 5(a) and (b),respectively.The source model of the solid lines and dashed lines is in case 2 of Equation (5). The source model of the dashdotted line is in case 1 of Equation(5),which indicates that particles do not propagate in the solar atmosphere.In addition, the solid and dash-dotted lines indicate that particles propagate in the interplanetary space with perpendicular diffusion,and the dashed lines indicate particles without perpendicular diffusion. In Figure 5(a),the flux indicated by the solid line is the largest, and that indicated by the dash-dotted line is the smallest.In Figure 5(b), the flux indicated by the solid line is the largest, and that indicated by the dashed line is the smallest.Therefore, the propagation effect of particles in the solar atmosphere is stronger/weaker than that of the perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space when the particle source decreases slower/ faster toward the flank of the source with $\phi _ { 0 } = 1 5 ^ { \circ } / \phi _ { 0 } = 5 ^ { \circ }$ Comparing these two panels,the timescale of the rising phase of the flux,indicated by a solid line in panel (a),is smaller than that in panel (b).

# 3.3.ParticlesPropagatingin the SolarAtmosphere

Figure 6(a) shows time profiles of a $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ proton omnidirectional flux observed at different locations,and Figure 6(b) shows the normalized fluxes.We use the source model as shown in case 2 of Equation (5), and $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to 0.126 AU for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ particles at the 1 AU equatorial plane.Here,particles produced by a flare can propagate in the solar atmosphere,and they can also cross field lines with perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space.The source parameter $\phi _ { s }$ is set to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ . Three observersarelocatedinthe ecliptic at1AUwith differentlongitudes such that the center of the source is located at $0 ^ { \circ }$ ， $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ 5 and $E 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ ,respectively,to the foot-point of the observer.According to the observers,the flux is the largest when the observer is connected to the center of the source,and itis the smallest when the center of the source is located at $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ to the foot-point of the observer.Figure 6(b) reveals thatthe onset times of the three fluxes are different.In the source model, when $\phi$ is larger than $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ , the time profile of the SEP source changes with $\phi$ . Asa result, the time profiles of the SEP flux in the cases of $E 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ increase more slowly than that in the case of longitude $0 ^ { \circ }$ .In this condition,when the observer is far from the center of the source $( \phi > 1 5 ^ { \circ } )$ , theangular distance should affect the VDA results.

# 3.4.Particles Accelerated by a Large Corona Shock

Figure 7is similar to Figure 6 butwith a different SEP source near the Sun.We use the SEP source model as shown in case 3 of Equation (5), and $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to 0.126 AU for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ particles at the 1AU equatorial plane.Particles are accelerated by a corona shock,and they can also cross the field lines with perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space. The source parameter $\phi _ { s }$ is set to $6 0 ^ { \circ }$ ，and $\phi _ { 0 }$ is set to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ .Three observers are located at the 1 AU equatorial plane with different longitudes such that the center of the source is located at $0 ^ { \circ }$ ， $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ ，and $E 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ respectively,to the foot-point of the observer.In this case, the observers are connected to the source by magnetic field lines.Therefore,the effects of particles propagating in the solar atmosphere and perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space have little effect on the onset time of SEP fluxes.Because the time profile of the source does not change with $\phi$ in our model,the time profiles of fluxes detected by three observers are similar during the rising phase in Figure 7(b).As a result, the angular distance between the center of the source and the observer should not affect the VDA results.However,if the time profile of the SEP source changes with angular distance, the time profiles of flux detected by the observers should be different.This conclusion could be deduced from the results in

Figure 6.In this case, the VDA results should change with the angular distance between the center of source and observer.

# 3.5.VDAMethodResults

In this subsection,we will study how the perpendicular diffusion and different source models affect the VDA method results.The VDA method assumes that the first observed particles are the ones traveling along the magnetic field lines, and the path length traveled by the particles is independent of energy.If this holds,the transport time for SEPs is given by

$$
t _ { o } - t _ { i } = { \frac { L } { v } } ,
$$

where $L$ isa constant that represents the field line length, $t _ { o }$ is the onset time of the SEP flux that depends on particle speed, $t _ { i }$ is a constant that represents the release time of particles on the source,and $v$ is the speed of the energetic particles.

Figures 8(a) and(b) show the dispersion of the onset time changes with $\mathrm { c / v }$ according to different source durations, where the observers are located at equator $0 ^ { \circ }$ longitude and the observer's field line is connected directly to the center of the source near the Sun.The only difference between Figures 8(a) and(b) is the source duration times.In Figure 8,the source model is set as case 1 of Equation(5),and the source parameter $\phi _ { s }$ is set to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ .Here,we get time profiles of SEP fluxes with simulations for four energy channels: $1 0 \mathrm { M e V } , 2 0 \mathrm { M e V } , 4 0 \mathrm { M e V } ,$

and $8 0 \mathrm { M e V . }$ We set the SEP background as $1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ of the flux peak,indicating a low background.From the SEP fluxes we obtain the onset times as the the times when the fluxes rise above the background.As one can see, the onset time increases linearlywith $\mathrm { c / v . }$ Based on the results of data fitting,the release time near the Sun and the interplanetary field length can be derived.

With different observing locations,background levels,and source duration times,the calculated source release times and path lengths from the VDA method with simulation data are listed in Table 1.In our simulations,the source release time is set to O,and the IMFis set to the Parker field model with the solar wind speed $4 0 0 \mathrm { k m s ^ { - 1 } }$ . In this table, the source release time and pathlength derived from VDA are labeled as $t _ { i }$ and $L$ ,respectively.Also, $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to 0.126 AU for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons in the ecliptic at 1 AU. The source model is set as case 1 of Equation (5),and $\phi _ { s }$ is set to $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ .The observers are alllocated at the 1AU equatorial plane but at different longitudes.When the observer is connected to the source, we have the following findings.In the cases of impulsive source duration (cases 1-3), the VDA release times are very close to the injection times on the source (less than three minutes).In the cases of gradual source duration (cases4-6),however, the VDA release times are much later than the real release times. On the other hand,when the observer is disconnected from the source,the onset time of the SEP flux is later than the case when the observer is connected to the source.Therefore,the VDA results are generally much worse when the observeris disconnected from the source,with some exceptions.For example,in $W 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ of case 4,the release time of the VDA result is very close to the injection time on the source (less than two minutes).Obviously,this result is obtained fortuitously,and it cannot be taken as an indication that the VDA method is valid. In all six cases (cases 1-6), the path lengths obtained from the VDA method are longer than the real ones from the Parker spiral.Even when the observer is connected to the center of the flare with an impulsive duration source and a low background SEPlevel, the path length is still larger than that of the Parker spiral.This is because scattering in the interplanetary space could not be ignored because of the

Note.a In this table, $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to $0 . 3 \mathrm { A U }$ for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons in the ecliptic at1AU.

value of the MFP used in our simulation. Besides scattering in the interplanetary space,the source duration, source location, and SEP background level also affect the pathlength result of the VDA.Therefore, in case 6 of Table 1, the path lengths are much larger than that of the Parker spiral.

Table 2 is similar to Table 1 except for the MFP.Here, $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to $0 . 3 \mathrm { A U }$ for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons in the ecliptic at 1 AU in Table 2.When the observer is connected to the source,we have the following findings.In cases1 and 2, the VDA release times are very close to the injection times on the source (less than3minutes).However,in case3 thedifference between the VDA release time and the injection times can be as large as 6.8 minutes.In the cases of gradual source duration (cases 4-6), the VDA release times are much later than the real release times. Because of the larger MFPs,the path length derived from VDA in case 1 is much smaller than that in Table1.The value of $1 . 3 4 \mathrm { A U }$ is closer to the length of the Parker spiral. On the other hand,when the observer is disconnected from the source,the VDA release times are also very close to the injection times (less than three minutes) in case 1.However, in other cases, the VDA release times are generally worse when the observer is disconnected from the source,with some exceptions.In all six cases (cases 1-6),the path lengths obtained from the VDA method are longer than the real ones from the Parker spiral. Comparing Table2 with Table1, the path lengths obtained from the VDA method in Table 2 are smaller than that in Table 1.

Table 3 is similar to Table 1,except for the source model and MFP.In Table 3,the source model is set as case 2 of Equation (5),and particles can diffuse at the source region. The source parameters are set to $\phi _ { s } = 1 5 ^ { \circ }$ ， $t _ { c } = 0 . 0 2$ day,and $t _ { l } = 0 . 0 5$ day in all six cases.When $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to 0.126 AU for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons in the ecliptic at 1 AU, the propagation effect of particles in the solar atmosphere is stronger than that of the perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space.In cases $1 - 3 , \lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to 0.126 AU for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons,and $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to $0 . 3 \mathrm { A U }$ for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons in cases 4-6.Comparing cases 1-3 in Table 3 with the impulsive duration cases in Table1,we have the following findings.The VDA release times are much closer to the injection times on the source in Table 3 than that in Table1, and the path lengths in Table 3 are generally smaller than that in Table1.The difference between the VDA release timesand the injection times are within seven minutes. Comparing cases 4-6 in Table 3 with the impulsive duration cases in Table 2, we find that the VDA results are similar in these two tables, especially in the low-background case.This is because when $\lambda _ { \parallel }$ is set to $0 . 3 \mathrm { A U }$ for $1 0 \mathrm { M e V }$ protons at the 1 AU equatorial plane,the effect of perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space is stronger than that of particles propagating in the solar atmosphere.

# 4.DISCUSSIONAND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper,we discuss the uncertainty of the simple assumptions of the VDA method.First, the VDA results could be significantlyaffected by interplanetary scattering(Kallenrode& Wibberenz 199O;Lintunen & Vainio 2004;Diaz et al. 2011). Second, the onset time of the SEP eventis hard to determine in practical applications because it can be significantly delayed by the background level (Saiz et al.2OO5). Third,particles can cross the field lines when they transport in the space. The perpendicular diffusion plays a very important role in the release time determination,especially when the observer's field line is disconnected from the source (Zhang et al. 2Oo9;Qin et al.2O11;He et al.2011).Fourth,different source models affect the accuracy of results of the VDA method.For example, particles accelerated by a flare may directly propagate in the solar atmosphere(Wibberenz et al. 1989),and a large shock could provide a very wide source (Mason et al. 1984; Gosling 1993; Zank et al. 200O; Li et al. 2003).

Bynumerically solving the focused Fokker-Planck equation, we have calculated SEP intensity time profiles,including the perpendicular diffusion.We set different source durations and background levels to study the onset times observed by observers.Comparing the time profiles of SEPfluxes observed at different locations,we have studied the effect of different source models and perpendicular diffusion on the onset times of SEP events and its influence on the VDA method results.Our new findings are as follows.

1. If SEPs are produced by a solar flare, they can spread much wider than the source region by two possible mechanisms. In the first one,particles propagate in the solar atmosphere. In the second one,particles cross the field lines in the interplanetary space by perpendicular diffusion. In this case,the VDA results can be affected by the above two mechanisms when the observer is not connected to the source at the initial time.In addition,because of the effect of convection,more particles are injected in the field line of the observer when the source is located at the east flank to the foot-point of the observer than that in the case of the west flank.This effect would lead to the eastwest asymmetry of the SEP distribution in the interplanetary space.

2.When the observer is connected to the source by the IMF, comparing the time profiles of fluxes in the cases with and without perpendicular diffusion,or with and without particle propagation in the solar atmosphere,the onset times are much the same.In this case,the effects of the particles perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space and propagation in the solar atmosphere do not affect the results of the VDA significantly. The results obtained by previous simulations,which did not include these two mechanisms (Kallenrode&Wibberenz 199O;Lintunen& Vainio 2004; Saiz et al. 2005;Diaz et al. 2011),stillholdswhen these two mechanisms are included.

3. If SEPs accelerated by a solar flare cannot propagate in the solar atmosphere,the SEP source region is about the size of the solar flare.In this case,when the observer is disconnected from the source by the IMF, the energetic particles can be detected with the effect of the perpendicular diffusion.The onset time is later when the observer is disconnected from the source than when the observer is connected to the source.In the cases of weak scattering, the solarrelease time derived from theVDA methodis close to the injection time when the observer is disconnected from the source with impulsive source duration and low background.However,in the cases of strong scattering, the release time and the path length obtained from the VDA method are much different from the real values,except in some fortuitous cases.

4.If SEPs accelerated by a solar flare can propagate in the solar atmosphere,the SEP source region should be larger than the size of the solar flare as time goes by.When the observer is far from the SEP source at the initial time, the particles will spend some time on leaving the source tothe observer's fieldline.Asaresult,the timescale of the rising phase of the flux is larger than that in the case when the observeris connectedto the center of the source. When source diffusion in the solar atmosphere is faster than perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space, the solarreleasetime derivedfrom theVDA methodis close to the injection time when the observer is disconnected from the source with a low background.If source diffusion in the solar atmosphere is slower than perpendicular diffusion,the VDA results are significantly affected by the MFP.In the case of weak scattering, the solar release time derived from the VDA method is still valid with impulsive source duration andlow background.However, in the case of strong scattering,the solar release time derived from the VDA method is not valid.

5.If SEPs are accelerated by a large-scale corona shock, the source can cover a verywide region because of the size of the corona shock.The observers located at different locations can be connected to the Sun simultaneously. Therefore, the effects of particles propagating in the solar atmosphere and perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space have little effect on the onset time of SEP fluxes and the VDA results,and the accuracy of the VDA method depends on other conditions.If the time profile of the SEP source does not change with the angular distance between the foot-point of the observer's magnetic field line and the center of the source,the onset time of fluxes observed at different locations could be much the same.In this case, the VDA results do not change with the angular distance. Otherwise, the time profile of the SEP source changes with angular distance,and the onset time of the SEP flux and the VDA results will change with angular distance.

6.In our simulations, the VDA results could be significantly affected by the location and size of the SEP source.As shown inprevious studies(Kallenrode& Wibberenz 1990; Lintunen & Vainio 20O4; Saiz et al. 2005;Diaz et al. 2011), the VDA results are also significantly affected by the time profile of the source, the parallel MFP,and the background level.In orderto reduce errorinthe resultsoftheVDA method,an ideal SEP event should meet the following conditions:impulsive source duration,large parallel MFP, low background level, and good connection between the observer and the source.
