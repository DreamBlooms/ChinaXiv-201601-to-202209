Abstract: The water resources of the Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin in Tunisia exhibit semi-arid and arid climatic conditions. This induces an excessve pumping of groundwater, which creates drops in water level ranging about $1 { - } 2 \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { a }$ . Indeed, these unfavorable conditions require interventions to rationalize integrated management in decision making. The aim of this study is to determine a water recharge index (WRI), delineate the potential groundwater recharge area and estimate the potential groundwater recharge rate based on the integration of statistical models resulted from remote sensing imagery, GIS digital data (e.g, lithology, soil, runof), measured artificial recharge data, fuzzy set theory and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Eight factors affecting potential groundwater recharge were determined, namely lithology, soil, slope,topography, land cover/use, runoff, drainage and lineaments. The WRI is between 1.2 and 3.1, which is classified into five classes as poor, weak, moderate, good and very good sites of potential groundwater recharge area. The very good and good classes occupied respectively $2 7 \%$ and $44 \%$ of the study area. The potential groundwater recharge rate was $43 \%$ of total precipitation. According to the results of the study, river beds are favorable sites for groundwater recharge.

# 1 Introduction

Groundwater is a development element in the dry area around the Mediterranean that naturally appeared as a particularly sensitive domain of the constraints of supply in fresh water. Moreover, increasing water demand due to agricultural,urban and industrial development, greatly stressed the water resources. In the future， water overexploitation will aggravate water shortages and cause social, economic and food security problems,especially in the southern Mediterranean countries.The groundwater resources are highly sensitive to human activities and climatic conditions (Jaiswal et al., 2003; Yeh et al., 2009, 2016).

Tunisian state has succeeded, since the 1990s, to mobilize $90 \%$ of the potential water resources (Ayadi,2014). Despite this success in the integrated administration of hydraulic resources, the hydrological situation of the country has been always ready to the risk of water scarcity in the years to come (Ayadi, 2014).

The delineation of groundwater recharge areas and the estimation of the natural recharge rate are important areas of research to avoid water shortages in the future. The results obtained using GIS in scientific research have attracted the attention of researchers in the fields of water resources.The use of Geographic Information System(GIS) tools in the research of the groundwater recharge area has heightened from early 1990s (Krishnamurthy et al.,2000; Jha et al.,2007; Kallali et al., 2007; Tweed et al.,2007; Chenini et al.,2010; Riad et al.,2011a,b; Yeh et al.,2016). GIS-based mapping can provide precise data concerning the spatial distribution. Remote sensing coupled with statistical models, such as Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), are largely used in water resources investigation (Jha et al.,2Oo7; Madrucci et al., 2008; Preeja et al., 2011; Rahman et al.,2012; Rashid et al.,2012; Jasrotia et al.,2013; Yeh et al.,2016).

Intensive exploitation of groundwater resources resulting from social and economic development in the Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin has caused a piezometric drop of $2 0 \mathrm { m }$ , during the last decade in some areas of the basin (Souei et al.,2018). This indicates that Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin is highly sensitive to groundwater level fluctuation. These critical situations involve interventions to rationalize the integrated management of water resource in the basin. The use of efficient tools such as GIS and remote sensing coupled with statistical methods is required for sustainable development of water resources in the basin. Therefore, statistical study is required to establish a relationship between factors having impacts on the groundwater recharge to take into account the impact of each factor in the water recharge index.

The objectives of this study are the delimitation of the groundwater recharge area from the WRI and the determination of the potential groundwater recharge rate in the Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin.The factors that affect groundwater recharge are evaluated.The weights of the factors are determined and analyzed using the MCDM,AHP and Fuzzy logic. The maps of the spatial distribution of factors are completed based on the GIS and remote sensing tools and methods.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1 Study area

The study was performed in the Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin $( 3 9 ^ { \circ } 4 5 ^ { \prime } 5 0 ^ { \prime \prime }  – 4 0 ^ { \circ } 2 0 ^ { \prime } 0 0 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { N }$ $1 1 ^ { \circ } 0 1 ^ { \prime } 4 0 ^ { \prime \prime } – 1 1 ^ { \circ } 2 5 ^ { \prime } 3 0 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E }$ ; Fig.1), Tunisia.It is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with an iregular rainfall and long dry periods with a mean annual precipitation of $1 5 0 { - } 3 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ (GWRD, 2013a) and potential mean annual evapotranspiration of $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m m } }$ . The annual mean temperature is about $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ：

The area ofNadhour-Sisseb-ElAlem Basin is $1 9 4 6 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ and consists of 27 sub-basins (Souei and Zouaghi,2Ol7). Streams are sporadic due to the lack of runoff for most of the year. Special hydrological characteristics,insuficient sporadic flows and floods produce rare torrential and turbid flows that lead to generally endorheic systems.The Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin has four hill dams (Ogla, Sehel, Kseb and Saidaine,and great Nebhana Dam) and more than 40 hily lakes.

The Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin includes multilayered aquifer system composed of deep and phreatic aquifers (Souei, 2019). The phreatic aquifers correspond to sandy-conglomerate deposits of Quaternary age (Fig. 2). The deep aquifers are stored in the Oligocene and Miocene-Quaternary series.Aquifer system is very prone to seasonal piezometric level fluctuations which are closely linked to rainfall natural recharge. The groundwater usually flows from the northwest to southeast. The pumping tests show that transmissivity varies between $2 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ and $8 . 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { s }$ .The permeability,calculated by the product of the aquifer thickness and transmissivity, varies between $\phantom { 0 } { 0 . 3 4 } \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ and $3 . 3 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { \dot { ~ m } / s }$ . From the hydrogeological aspect, the basin is divided into three connected sub-basins according to its main structural framework (Souei et al., 2Ol8; Souei and Zouaghi,2018)(Fig. 2). The first sub-basin is in the Nadhour region marked by thickness Oligocene and Neogene-Quaternary deposits. The second one is in the Sisseb region presenting a high domain characterized by thinning of Miocene-Quaternary and low Oligocene series (Souei et al., 2021). The third one is in El Alem region corresponding to a subsiding zone with a thick Mio-PlioQuaternary series,which is about $2 \mathrm { k m }$ . Artificial recharge is $2 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ in the period 1992-2013 (GWRD, 2013b).

Water resources are exploited to supply the drinking water, industrial and agricultural sectors. The exploitation of groundwater grows from $1 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ in 1976 to $2 3 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ in 2013.The intense pumping has lowered the groundwater level, which is around $4 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ in some areas.(Souei, 2012; Souei et al., 2018; Souei and Zouaghi, 2018). This has influenced the water supply.

# 2.2 Methods

Data used in this study includes the Landsat 8 satelite images (23 October 2017), shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM)， pedological map with a scale of 1:500,000, the Jebel Fkirine, Enfidhaville, Jbebina, SidiBou Ali, AinJloula and SebkhaKelbia geological maps with a scale of 1:50,000. Remote sensing technique can be used to improve location accuracy and make precise mapping (Aouragh et al.,2016).In this work, we identified eight factors,lithology, soil, slopes, topography, land cover and use, drainage, lineaments and runoff,which affect the potential groundwater recharge. The use of GIS has achieved several thematic maps that characterize the study area.The method used in this study (Fig. 3) corresponds to a succession of steps for the automatic extraction of hydrographic network, lineaments and slope. The digitalization technique of geological maps was chosen to identify lithology. The data provided by the various GIS tools are used after a correction of the result, with reference to field data, topographic and geological maps.

For more precision in the results and its spatial distribution, the study area was subdivided in grids of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m } \times 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m }$ . Within each grid, the necessary data have been added. The recharge map was obtained by the sum of the weights of the eight parameters.

$$
\mathrm { W R I } = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \mathrm { E R } _ { i } \ ,
$$

$$
\mathrm { E R } = \mathrm { P R } \times \mathrm { R W } \times \mathrm { A R } \times W ,
$$

where WRI is the water recharge index; $\mathrm { E R } _ { i }$ is the effective rate for each map; $i$ is a factor; $n$ is the number offactors; PR is the proposed rate; RW is the proposed relative weight; AR is the assigned rate; and $W$ is AHP weight.

Firstly, the factors that influence the groundwater recharge related to the study area were determined in reference to the published scientific and technical guideline documents.In the first stage the order of importance of every factor was established. Figure 4 shows the relationship among the factors and illustrates their influence and interaction. The order of importance of every factor was determined based on the influence of each factor in the relationship.The weight 1 was assigned to a major effect and the weight 0.5 was assigned to a minor effect (Shaban et al., 2006). RWof every factor $( i )$ is the addition of the number of major effect $( x )$ and number of minor effect $( \nu )$ ofthis factor( ${ \mathrm { R W } } _ { i } { = } x _ { i } { \times }$ majoreffect $+ y _ { i } \times$ minor effect), the results are showed in Table 1.

Then, the each factor was subdivided into classes describing the domain of effect. Each class was expressed by a numerical value, expressing their order of importance by using fuzzy logic (Zadeh,1965) instead of Saaty scale (Saaty,1980). Fuzzy logic presents an extension of classical set theory (Leberling,1981; Buckley,1984). The classical logic represents the membership of an element by true (if the element belongs) or false (if the element does not belong) (Zadeh,1965). Fuzzy logic replaces the degree membership, of proposition, represented in true/false by a degree of membership (Zadeh,1987) in the interval [0,1] (Rezaei et al.,2013). The non-membership is represented by O,the total membership is represented by 1，and the partial membership is represented by values between O and 1 (Saaty, 1980). Fuzzy logic also allows us to move from a linguistic ranking (very good, moderate, very low,..) to a numerical ranking. IfA is a class of the set $\mu$ in fuzzy logic,the membership relation is determined as $\scriptstyle \mu A = \mathrm { U } \to [ 0 , 1 ]$ ,and the order of intervention is between O and 1.

The weight of factors is obtained by the establishment of the interactive interrelationship diagram of various factors (Shaban et al., 2Oo6).The interrelationship diagram is suitably revised based on expert consulting, international published guidelines and scientific documents.The AHP method is used to determinate the contribution and occurrence of each factor (Saaty,198o).The rate for each class is assigned according to the Fuzzy set theory (Zadeh,1965).

In this study, fuzzy logic in linear function was applied in the determination of the PR of each class. AR was determined by RW multiply PR.

In the third step, the $W$ of a factor was chosen according to the linear method using AHP method (Saaty,1980). A matrix of pair-wise comparisons was determined and it was a reciprocal matrix. Referring to the order of importance of factors deduced previously from the membership relation, the matrix calculation was made by dividing the importance value of a factor in the row by the importance value of a factor in the column. W was determined (Eqs.3 and 4)by the normalization of the sum of each row by the total of the matrices; the results are showed in Table 2.ER of each class was determined by W multiply PR.

$$

where $n$ is the number of factors; $i$ is a factor; $L _ { k }$ is the sum of the line of factor $k$ $L _ { i }$ is the total of the sum of lines; and $R W$ is the proposed relative weight

The matrix reliability was determined by calculation of the consistency ratio (CR) which was deduced from the consistency index (CI) (Saaty, 1980).

Indeed if $\mathrm { C R } { > } 0 . 1$ ,the decision set could be too inconsistent to be powerful (Saaty,1980). In practice, $\mathrm { C R } { > } 0 . 1$ occasionally has to be admitted. If $\mathrm { C R } { = } 0 . 0$ , it means that the decision is absolutely reliable (Saaty, 1980).

The CI is a measure of the departure from consistency and it is calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm { C I } = { \frac { \gamma - n } { n - 1 } } ,
$$

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \gamma = \left( \sum _ { j = n } ^ { n } \left( L _ { j } / W _ { j } \right) \right) / n , } \end{array}
$$

where y is the average value of the consistency vector; $L$ is the consistency vectors of factor $j$ ；W is the AHP weight of factor $j$ ; and $n$ is the eight influencing factors.

Finally, a sensitivity analysis parameter was determined. This technique was applied to evaluate the eficiency of the potential groundwater recharge index map carried out using the eight parameters (Eq. 9). Sensitivity analysis of the single parameter (Napolitano and Fabbri,1996) was an achievement to control the impact of the factors in the potential groundwater recharge index. This inspection was accomplished by comparing "effective" and assigned "AHP weight" weight of each factor (Singh et al., 2015).

$$
W _ { p i } = \left( P _ { r i } \times P _ { w i } / V \right) \times 1 0 0 ,
$$

where $W _ { p i }$ is the effective weight $( \% )$ · $P _ { r i }$ is the rating of respective parameters; $P _ { w i }$ is the weight of parameters; and $V$ is the final vulnerability index.

# 3 Results

# 3.1 Factors influencing groundwater recharge

# 3.1.1 Lithology

Lithology is a significant factor influencing groundwater recharge by guiding the water penetration (Elewa and Qaddah,2011). The lithology map was extracted from a geological map with a scale of 1:50,000.The lithology map makes it possible to determine the favorable infiltration zone. The relief areas, formed by a calcareous crust, show a weak infiltration. Salty depressions, formed by clays,silts and evaporites,are unfavorable to infiltration.The lithology can also control the drainage density and fracturing intensity by affecting the time of concentration of the waters in the basin (Kirpich,1940) and control the secondary porosity.

The PR of the lithology was determined.The alluviums and gravel sand admited a PR value of 1.00 and marls had a PR value of 0.Oo.PR values of the other classes were between O.0O and 1.00 (Table 3).

The lithology map shows that the areas formed by sand, sandstone and wadi beds were the most favorable to the infiltration (Fig.5).The central parts of the basin,formed by sand, sandstone and wadi beds were moderately favorable.The areas of relief, formed by a limestone crust, had low infiltration. Salted depressions formed by clays,silts and evaporites were unfavorable to infiltration.

# 3.1.2 Soil

Infiltration is mostly affected by the soil estate near the surface (Hillel,1982; Lowery et al.,1997). Soil texture is the main factor affecting infiltration (Hillel,1982). Water flows faster through the larger pores of sandy soil than via the little pores of clay soil. Porous soil allow water to flow-in and to recharge underground aquifers. The soil map was generated based on the pedological map (1:500,000) of Tunisia.

The PR of the soil surface map (Table 3） was determined by calculating the correspondence values for each class.Building area received a PR value of O.Oo.Mineral soil and wadi beds had a PR value of 1.O0 (Table 3).PR values of the other classes were between O.00 and 1.00.

Soil of the study area was subdivided into five classes, including building, hydromorphic and allomorphic soils,poor soils,rendzine soils and mineral soil and wadi beds (Fig.6). Soils and mineral soil and wadi beds occupied $3 6 \%$ of the study area.Rendzine soil located in the upstream occupied $2 9 \%$ of the study area.Poor soils occupied $1 7 \%$ of the study area.

# 3.1.3 Slope

The topography inclination influences the infiltration (Al Saud, 2O10) by control the intensity of water flow. It influences flow velocity, concentration time, transport of sediment and vertical and lateral digging in the wadi beds (Zaoui,2Oo9). For the steep slope, water runs rapidly on the surface and produces a smaller recharge rate (Yeh et al.,2Oo9). The gentle slope increases water infiltration into the soil. Slope gradient map was done by using the slope algorithm in hydrology tools through the ArcGIS 10.1.

The slope values ranged from $0 \%$ to $44 \%$ (Table 3). The flat terrain had PR value of1.OO and the terrain with slope $44 \%$ had a PR value of O.OO,and PR values of the other classes were between 0.00 and 1.Oo (Table 3). The slope was reclassified by a negative linear equation, $f ( x ) { = } - 0 . 0 2 2 x { + } 1$ （204号 $( x \in [ 0 { - } 4 4 ] )$ ,where $x$ is slope.

The slope values ranged from $3 . 4 \%$ to $4 4 . 0 \%$ (Fig. 7). The slope values were subdivided into four classes,including $0 . 0 \% 3 . 4 \%$ ， $3 . 4 \% - 9 . 4 \%$ $9 . 4 \% - 1 8 . 0 \%$ and $1 8 . 0 \% { - 4 4 . 0 \% }$ . The class with slope values of $0 . 0 \% { - 3 . 4 \% }$ represented $80 \%$ of the total study area. The slope values were high at the north and west part of the study area, while slope values were very low and close to zero at the south and center part of the study area.

# 3.1.4 Topography

Topography (Toth,1963), hydraulic conductivity and geology (Freeze and Witherspoon,1967) define the hydrological landscape and hydraulic function of the basin (Winter, 2O01). The topography (relief and the variation of wavelength) of the basin controls the direction and intensity of groundwater flow (Haitjema and Mitchell-Bruker, 2005; Bresciani,2011). In fact, where the water table intercepts the topography,the seepage condition is highlighted and a discharge area occurs in this place.These conditions influence not only the flow direction,but also the effective recharge since the aquifer outcrop areas reduce the infiltration area. The aquifers exposed in the low topographic zone make a discharge area (Bresciani, 2011). The steeper slope implies a smaller seepage area.

Topography values ranged from 2 to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ in the study area. The flat terrain was attributed the PR value of 0.O0, the higher elevation of $5 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ was attributed the PR value of 1.O0, and the other classes were attributed PR values between O.OO and 1.00. The topography was reclassified by a linear equation, $f ( x ) { = } 0 . 0 0 2 x$ $( x \in [ 0 \mathrm { - } 5 0 0 ] )$ ,where $x$ is topography.

The topography map shows that topography values ranged from 2 to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ (Fig. 8). Topography was divided into five categories: a very low topography with elevation $\mathord { \mathrm { \Omega } } \mathrm { \leq } 1 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ ,representing $5 9 . 0 \%$ of the study area; a low topography with elevation between 100 and $2 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ , representing $2 6 . 0 \%$ of the study area; an average topography with elevation between 2O0 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ , representing $1 4 . 0 \%$ （20 of the study area; a high topography with elevation between 300 and $4 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ , representing $2 . 0 \%$ of the study area; and a very high topography with elevation above $4 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ , representing less than $0 . 1 \%$ （204号 of the study area (Fig. 8).

# 3.1.5 Land cover/use

The land cover/use map was generated by using the satelite images through the ArcGIS 10.1. The recharge rate is related to land cover/use (Leduc et al.,2Ool). Vegetation increases the infiltration rates (Shaban et al.， 2Oo6). Effectively， biological activities； burrow creations and root decomposition help to unpack the rock and soil.This facilitates infiltration and percolation of water. Vegetation decrease direct water evaporation (Wang et al., 2O18） and slows the water runoff Water absorbed by the plant reduces water loss. Urban area decreases the infiltration rate and increases runoff. Natural hydrological processes such as infiltration are influenced by land cover changes caused by mainly human activities； agriculture expansion, deforestation, construction works and urbanization.

The surface water body admitted a PR value of 1.O0,those building had a PR value of 0.Oo (Table 3). PR values of the other classes were between O.0O and 1.O0. The land cover/use map was dominated by the agricultural and bare Land. The forest, building and water areas occupied $0 . 0 4 \%$ $( 4 . 2 5 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } )$ ， $0 . 0 1 \%$ （20 $( 4 . 2 5 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } )$ and $0 . 0 1 \%$ （20 $( 5 . 5 0 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 \cdot }$ )of the study area, respectively (Fig. 9).

# 3.1.6Drainage density

The drainage network was mapped from SRTM by using an algorithm for automatic extraction, flow accumulation algorithms in hydrology tools through the ArcGIS 10.1. The drainage density represents the number of segments per unit of the study area (Greenbaum,1985). In the present study, drainage density was determined by applying the line density algorithms in the ArcGIS 10.1. Drainage density has an inverse role as permeability (Luo,19oo; Harlin and Wijeyawickrema, 1985). Indeed, a zone with an important drainage density designate less infiltration (Machiwal et al., 2011), which favors runoff and therefore acts as a poor prospect of groundwater.

Drainage density values ranged from 0.15 to 2.50 segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ . The drainage densities ${ \ < } 0 . 1 5$ segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ received a PR value of 1.OO (Table 3).The drainage densities ${ \Rightarrow } 2 . 5$ segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { - 2 }$ assigned a PR value of O.00. The drainage densities between 0.15 and O.25 segment per $\bar { \mathrm { k m } } ^ { 2 }$ assigned PR values between 1.00 and O.Oo by the application of a negative linear equation, $f ( x ) = -$ $0 . 0 4 x \substack { + 1 }$ （ $( x \in [ 0 . 0 { - 2 } . 5 ] )$ , where $x$ is drainage density.

The drainage density map shows that drainage density values ranged from 0.15 to 2.50 segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ (Fig.10). It was divided into four categories: a very low drainage density area with the value ${ \mathrm { < } } 0 . 6 2$ segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ; a low drainage density area with the value between O.62 and 1.25 segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ; a zone with an average drainage density with the value between 1.25 and 1.87 (segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ); and a high drainage density are with the value above 1.87 segment per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ： The drainage density map shows that the basin was dominated by the average drainage density areas which occupied $48 \%$ of the study area. The low and high drainage density areas occupied $24 \%$ and $21 \%$ of the study area,respectively. This indicates a large extension of the recharge area. Areas with low drainage density occupy the upstream at the outcrop of sandstone and sand.

Fig.10Drainage density of the study area

# 3.1.7 Lineament

The lineament density map was generated by the automatic extraction process from satellite images (Souei et al., 2O17). The lineament density is the number of lineament per unit of the study area (Fig.11). It is a secondary porosity and increases with the density representing the area with good groundwater potential. It is determined by applying the line density algorithm in ArcGIS 10.1.

The lineament density map shows that values of lineament density varied between O and 45 (lineament per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } .$ ). The lineament density of 45 lineament per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ took a PR value of 1.OO and of less than 45 lineament per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ took a PR value from O.0O to 1.0O (Table 3). The lineament class was determined by a positive linear equation, $f ( x ) { = } 0 . 0 2 2 x ( x \in [ 0 { - } 4 5 ] )$ ,where $x$ is lineament density.

The lineaments density was divided into three classes: a very low lineament density class with a value of O-10 lineament per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ,representing $64 \%$ of the study area; a low lineament density class with a value between 1O and 3O lineament per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ,representing $2 6 \%$ of the study area; and a high lineament density class with a value between 3O and 45 lineament per $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ , occupying the basin borders and superimposed on majorities with sandstones and sand outcrops. The very low lineament density class took over the entire lower topographic zone of the study area.

# 3.1.8 Runoff

Runoff occurs when precipitation intensity exceeds infiltration and soil surface retention capacity (Larue,20o0; Sauvadet et al.,20l2). The threshold for the onset of runoff varies according to the height and intensity ofrainfall, soil moisture,soil surface conditions (fissures, pebbles,clods, etc.), vegetation cover and physical properties of the soil (porosity and organic matter content) (Morsli et al., 2004).Lithomorphic soils, marls,clays and impermeable soils of urban areas (e.g.,roads,car parking,built-up areas, etc.） increase runoff at the expense of infiltration (Morsli et al., 2004; Sauvadet et al.,2O12).The PR of Runoff was defined by the determination of the correspondence rate for each class. Building area with high runoff admitted a PR value of O.0o (Table 3). Wadi beds with high infiltration had a PR value of 1.OO (Table 3).PR values of the other classes were between 0.00 and 1.00.

![](images/0a7596625601b776197371c4d8b1b34ab96254237a77f88b9d6aff9812cef33c.jpg)  
Fig.11Lineament density of the study area

The study area was dominated by the wadi deposit $( 3 4 . 0 0 \%$ of the total study area). The central part of the basin was dominated by alluvial deposits $( 3 0 . 0 0 \%$ of the total study area) (Fig. 12). The hilly areas were represented by a sand and sandstone deposit ( $22 \%$ of the total study area). The limestone and dolomites with fractures,marl, clay and building areas represented $7 . 0 0 \%$ ， $6 . 0 0 \%$ and $0 . 0 1 \%$ of the study area, respectively.

# 3.2 Determined consistency ratio (CR) and the sensitivity analysis

CR was calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm { C R } = { \frac { \mathrm { C I } } { \mathrm { R I } } } ,
$$

where RIis the Random index,whose value associated with the number of factors $( n )$ (Saaty, 1980), $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { R I } } = 1 . 4 1$ (Table 4). According to Equation 5, $\scriptstyle \mathrm { C I = 0 } . 0 0 2$ . Then, $\mathrm { C R } { = } 0 . 0 0 1$ . The calculated CR value was less than O.10,indicating that there is a realistic degree of consistency in the pair-wise comparison (Saaty, 1980).

Note:n,numberof factors;RI,random index.

The sensitivity analysis showed that in the assessment of potential groundwater recharge index, lithology and soil presented the most important factor as their effective weight ( $22 \%$ and $20 \%$ ， respectively)(Table 5） exceeded the theoretical weight $( 1 7 \% )$ . The sensitivity analysis indicated that lithology, soil, slope and topography were underestimated. However, land cover/use, drainage density, lineaments density and runoff were overestimated (Table 5).

# 3.3 Groundwater recharge potential areas

The obtained recharge indices were classified into five potential classes as poor, low, moderate, good and very good (Fig.13). Figure 13 indicates that very good potential areas only covered $2 7 \%$ of the study area. It was in the upstream and the southwest parts of the basin. Also,the areas with very good infiltration potential were mainly represented by wadi beds. The good infiltration class was located in the north and center of the basin, occupied about $44 \%$ of the study area and scattered all over the basin. Moderate infiltration class were mainly situated in the southeast and south parts of the basin and occupied $1 7 \%$ of the study area. Potentially poor and low classes occupied about $12 \%$ of the study area.

# 3.4Experimental validation and infiltration rate

After the establishment of the groundwater recharge potential areas,a validation of the used method followed by an estimate of natural infiltration rate was necessary. To achieve these objectives, the control data from three artificial recharge operation were used. The recharge campaigns were carried out since the Saidaine hill dam in the streambed of the Saadine wadi (Fig.13). These operations consisted of dropping water continuously over a period of time.The detail data of the three artificial recharge operations are shown in Table 6.The recharge operation was controlled by data measurement in four control stations (S1, S2, S3 and S4) located along the $1 1 \ \mathrm { k m }$ path from the streambed.

![](images/afbbbc634f11e641fc73bf71ee81078b41be1b30923aeb324a30a471747b5e44.jpg)  
Fig.13Groundwater recharge potential areas.WRI, water recharge index.

The locations of these stations were shown in Figure 13.Along the submersed wadi bed area, three reaches were defined (R1,R2 and R3) from the upstream to downstream. The average area of submersed zone was $0 . 1 1 5 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ (Ibn Ali et al.,2017).The measuring of difference between upstream and downstream water flows in the four control stations can determine the infiltration and evapotranspiration rates in the three reaches. It was determined as average values of the three campaigns for the three reaches (Table 6).

Indeed， for more precision, the potential evaporation (PE） measured at the Kairouan meteorological station during the recharge operations (2004,2005 and 2006) were used. In general, the average PE was $7 \%$ compared to the artificial recharge volume (Table 7). Statistical analysis of the three artificial recharge shows that the mean infiltration capacities of reaches R1,R2 and R3 were $32 \%$ ， $57 \%$ and $80 \%$ , respectively. The results show that the reach R1 is the zone with good recharge index (Fig.13), whereas the reaches R2 and R3 are the zones with very good recharge index.

The average infiltration capacity of the reaches R2 and R3 is $69 \%$ and the average infiltration capacity of reaches R1 and R2 is $45 \%$ . Indeed, the $69 \%$ infiltration capacity is attributed to a very good recharge index class and $45 \%$ infiltration capacity is attributed to a good recharge index class. The infiltration capacity for the other classes was determined arbitrarily (Table 8). To estimate the infiltration rate, the infiltration capacity of each recharge index class was determined (Table 8).

The natural infiltration rate was calculated by multiplying the precipitation by the infiltration capacity (Table 8). The average precipitation used in the estimate of infiltration rate was $3 6 4 \mathrm { m m }$ ： It was corresponding to the average annual precipitation for the period 1997-2013 (Fig.14). The result shows that the infiltration capacity (an average annual of $1 \dot { 6 } 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } .$ ）in the study area was $43 \%$ of the total precipitation (Table 8).

# 4Discussion

The present work confirmed the importance of the compilation of statistics methods, GIS and remote sensing in the determination of multidisciplinary method favorable in the delimitation of groundwater recharge potential areas. The use of fuzzy logic presented a more sophisticated and simple process to increase the degree of decision. Using Fuzzy logic process in the determination of the order of importance of factors and class becomes easier than using other process based on linguistic and vague patterns. The eight factors used were carefully selected to take into account the specificity of the region and the condition occurring in the aquifer water supply. Other methods used fewer factors. The decrease in the number of factors affects the degree of precision.

The determination of infiltration rate based on experimental data showed that the benefits of the intervention in the management of these zones were determined on the map. The infiltration map, Figure 13, presented a basic document of all future management in the basin. This study allowed the decision makers to choose the sites of intervention to compensate the pizometric drop existing in the basin, also to occur in the protection of the aquifer system against pollution. Despite its efficiency, this method took a time in the processing of the data, whether for the assembly of the raw data or during the processing of the rectification of the data.

The use of more accurate and detailed experimental data, some field studies makes it possible to improve results better. The programming of the method by computer system allows to accelerate the processes of establishment of the final result and to integrate the database and the results in the hydrodynamic mathematical modeling of the aquifer system.

# 5 Conclusions

Groundwater recharge potential area map is proposed for the Nadhour-Sisseb-El Alem Basin. The statistical method allows investigating the influence of geomorphological, climatic, geological and hydrological factors on the recharge of the aquifer. Indeed, this study demonstrates that the groundwater recharge index is more correlated with lithology and drainage. The quantity of supplies water from groundwater remains essentially linked to the climatic condition of the study area.The superposition of several layers of information, using GIS has allowed to develop a digital map supports for integrated water resources management. Indeed, this methodology allowed proposed recharge zones to remedy the alarming situation of the overexploited aquifers. The calibration of theoretic method with the artificial recharge operation confirms the utility of used method in the determination of the potential recharge areas. The natural infiltration capacity (an average of $1 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { a } )$ was $43 \%$ of the total precipitation.

The study clearly shows the interest in the use of spatial techniques,oered by GIS and remote sensing for hydrological study. Utilization of this method detailed in this work can be helpful to map the recharge area in others regions essentially the regions characterized by the difficult accessibility. This method is also applicable to delineation other natural disaster as the flood risk.
