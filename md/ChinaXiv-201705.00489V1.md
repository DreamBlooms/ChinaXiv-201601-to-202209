Inthis paper,flexible Ag electrodes witha hexagonalmicromesh structure were fabricated on PETsubstrate using aphotolithography technique.The efect of film thicknesson optical and electrical properties of Ag electrodes was investigated systematicall.Furthermore,these flexible transparent Ag mesh electrodes were firstly applied to a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) device and its performance was evaluated.All of the Ag electrodes exhibited a high average transmittance of about $8 0 . 2 \substack { - 8 5 . 0 \% }$ in the visible range $( 4 0 0 - 8 0 0 ~ \mathsf { n m } )$ ,and the minimum sheet resistance value reached $8 . 2 ~ \Omega ~ 5 \mathsf { q } ^ { - 1 }$ .The prepared Ag mesh also showed an excelent performance of adhesion and bending,demonstrating its superior durability.The PDLC device based on Ag mesh electrodes showed comparable performance with that using ITO electrodes,indicating that the Ag mesh film can be a good substitution for ITO electrodes in PDLC devices and may find practical application in large area flexible devices.

# 1 Introduction

Inrecent years,flexible devices have become an emerging trend and are finding various applications in daily life.1 A polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC)device，which has a basis structure of liquid crystals sandwiched bya pair of electrodes on a flexible PET substrate,is a promising device to modulate electro-optical performance in display devices and smart windows.² Most commonly， the transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) used for flexible devices nowadays are still based ona transparent conductive oxide,particularly indium-tin oxide (ITO) due to its excellent optical transmittance and low sheet resistance in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. However,an ITO electrode has drawbacks such as high price due to In metal deficiency and brittleness due to its ceramic nature,which restrain its application in large-scale flexible devices.4In recent decades,alternative TCEs have been investigated to replace ITO,including carbon nanotube networks,5,6 graphene, conductive polymers,8,9 random nanowires10,11 and Ag mesh.12-14 Among these,Ag mesh electrodes are promising candidates because they offer good optical transparency and high electrical conductivity as well as superior mechanical stability.15 It has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that their optical and electrical properties could be tuned relatively independently by changing the relevant geometrical parameters of Ag mesh structures,such as line width $( \boldsymbol { w } )$ ，period $( p )$ ,and thickness (h).12,16,17

Generally, the network structure of Ag mesh electrodes can be designed to be random or regular in shape.RandomAg mesh electrodes were fabricated by some novel methods such as nanosphere lithography,18 electrospun nanotroughs,19 inject printing,20,21 laser sintering,2² and methods based on the coffee ring effect.23,24 Recently,random Au meshes fabricated by grain lithography have demonstrated $8 3 \%$ transmittance at $2 0 \Omega$ $\mathsf { s q } ^ { - 1 }$ .25 Ag networks on PET are prepared by depositing Ag film inside the gaps of a cracked $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ gel mold,which has a high transmittance of $8 8 \%$ at $1 0 ~ \Omega ~ \mathrm { { s q } ^ { - 1 } }$ .26 Ag gratings of $78 \%$ transmittance at $2 3 ~ \Omega ~ \mathrm { s q } ^ { - 1 }$ have been investigated using nanoimprint lithography.27 However, these methods could give rise to problems of complex treatments and nonuniform performances which rely on the repeatability of molding.

On the other hand,physical lithography methods such as electron beam lithography,nanoimprint and photolithography have been used to prepare uniform and ordered $\mathbf { A g }$ meshes, which is in favor of the repeatability and device stability thanks to its uniform structure.However, the two previous methods are relatively costly and not scalable.As a conventional technique, photolithography has been applied for large-area patterning.28 Ag mesh electrodes fabricated using a photolithography method show a transmittance of $7 4 \%$ at about $\textnormal { 7 } \Omega \ \mathrm { s q } ^ { - 1 }$ .29,30 While these electrodes are mostly prepared on rigid substrates, few works are about flexible substrates.Furthermore,to our knowledge,the fabrication of a PDLC device with a Ag mesh film acting as electrodes has not been reported.

In this work,we demonstrate a hexagonal Ag mesh on PET substrates directly by photolithography,which act as the electrodes for the PDLCdevice.The effects of filmthickness on their performance are investigated systematically.The optical,electrical and mechanical properties of this Ag mesh film as well as the performance of the PDLC device are evaluated in detail.

# 2 Experimental

# 2.1 Fabrication procedure

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates were sequentially cleaned in ethanol,acetone and deionized water by ultrasonication for2 minutes each,followed by drying with nitrogen gas.Photolithography was performed in a yellow room inside a cleanroom.Fig.1 shows the schematic diagram of the fabrication of the Ag mesh film.AKMP e313ob photoresist (Kempur Microelectronics,China） was first spin coated on the PET substrates at $3 5 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ for 35 seconds and prebaked at $9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for 90 seconds.After exposing to $3 6 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ UV light using an $\mathbf { A B M } / 6 /$ 350/NUV/DCCD/MManual Mask Aligner System (ABM,USA) for 40 seconds，the photoresist was developed in KMP PD238 developer (Kempur Microelectronics,China) for 40 seconds.Ag films of different thicknesses ( $\mathrm { \Delta } ^ { \cdot } 1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ $2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ ， $4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ ， $5 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ,70 nm）were sputtered onto the samples after $5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ thick Cr deposition，acting as an adhesive layer，using JCP-350M2 magnetron sputtering apparatus (Technol, China). Finally,Ag mesh films were patterned aftera lift-off process in acetone.The line width and periodicity were set as $4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ respectively.

A PDLC device was fabricated using the above prepared $\mathbf { A g }$ mesh as a transparent electrode.NOA 65 (Norland products) and nematic LCE7 (Yantai Xianhua Chem-Tech.Co.,Ltd) were used as the pre-polymer and nematic LC mixture,respectively. The mixing ratio of NOA 65 and E7 was fixed at $2 : 3$ Silica microspheres with a mean diameter of $6 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ were used as spacers to control the thickness of the PDLC device.The substrates,Ag mesh coated PET films were cut into $4 0 \ : \mathrm { m m } \times 4 0 \$ mm pieces.Before using as electrodes,a thin layer of $z \mathrm { n o } : \mathrm { A l }$ with a thickness of $5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ was deposited on the Ag mesh for protection,ensuring the uniform conductivity of the electrode. The LC/NOA65 mixture was coated and spread on the bottom $\mathbf { A g }$ mesh electrode and then covered by a top Ag mesh electrode.

The sandwich structure was then exposed to UV light with the intensity of $1 5 \mathrm { \ m W \ c m ^ { - 2 } }$ for $8 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$

# 2.2 Characterization and measurement

The surface morphologies of the Ag mesh films were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-48oo). The optical transmittance and haze of the $\mathbf { A g }$ mesh films were obtained at room temperature using a UV-VisNIR spectrophotometer (Agilent,Cary 50oo).The sheet resistance was measured using a four-point probe system (ST2258A).The thicknesses of the films were calculated and conformed using atomic force microscopy (Veeco，Dimension 3100V).To investigate the mechanical properties,a bending test was carried out with home-made equipment. The adhesion test was performed using a $1 2 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ wide $3 \textbf { M }$ scotch tape to attach onto the Ag mesh film and then peeled off from the sample.To evaluate the performance of the fabricated PDLC device,the specular transmittance-voltage curve was measured using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (model M2oooDI) with an alternating voltage potential (0-12o V) applied across the device.

# 3 Results and discussion

# 3.1Microstructure of Ag mesh films

Five hexagonal Ag mesh films with thicknesses of 10,25,40,55 and $7 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ were prepared on PET substrates.Fig.2 shows the SEM images and the optical image of the fabricated $7 0 \ \mathrm { n m \ A g }$ micromesh patterns on the PET substrate.Fig.2a indicates a uniform and perfect metal network,and the enlarged image (Fig.2b) shows that the Ag wires are well connected with a straightboundary and smooth surface.The Ag film deposited using magnetic sputtering on an amorphous PET substrate indicated good quality with compact and homogenous distribution of small particles of about $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ (Fig. 2c). The line width measured from Fig.2c is about $5 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,deviating from the designed value of $4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ for the mask,which may be because of the deviation of the mask fabrication and photolithography process.The uniform and compact Ag film morphologies benefit its conductivity and mechanical performance.Fig. 2d shows the optical image of a Ag mesh film on a PET substrate, the letters on paper can be clearly seen through the Ag mesh transparent film.

# 3.2Optical and electrical properties of Ag mesh films

Fig.3 shows the optical transmittance spectra of the fabricated Agmesh with different thicknesses,all transmittance spectral measurements were referenced to air.Ag mesh films have almost constant transmittance values in the whole wavelength range.The average transmittance of the Ag mesh films on PET with 10,25,40,55,and $7 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ film thicknesses in the entire visible wavelength range $\left( 4 0 0 \mathrm { - } 8 0 0 \ \mathrm { \ n m } \right)$ were $8 5 . 0 \%$ ， $8 2 . 7 \%$ $8 1 . 5 \%$ ， $8 1 . 6 \%$ and $8 0 . 2 \%$ ,respectively.This indicates that all the Ag mesh films possess uniformity and ahigh transmittance of ${ > } 8 0 \%$ in a broad wavelength range.It was noticed that there is a slight decline while the film thickness is increasing to 70 nm,which may be because of the lager line width.Taking the open area ratio of the Ag mesh as $9 2 \%$ and the transmittance of the PET substrate as $9 0 \%$ ,1 the theoretical transmittance of the Ag mesh film should be around $8 2 . 8 \%$ .The transmittance of a Ag mesh of $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ film thickness in our experiment is $8 5 \%$ 5 which is attributed to the transparency of the Ag flm when the thickness is less than $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ .32

Sheetresistancevaluesweremeasuredandaresummarized in Table1.The measured sheet resistances of the Ag mesh films with thicknesses of 10,25,40,55 and $7 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ were 108.3,42.5, 18.1,12.3,and $8 . 2 ~ \Omega ~ \mathrm { s q } ^ { - 1 }$ ，respectively，which demonstrated a significant reduction when the film thickness increased from $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ to $7 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .It indicates that the sheet resistance of the transparent metal electrode could be controlled relatively independently by adjusting the thickness of the Ag mesh without sacrificing the optical transmittance,which is far different from the other types of TCEs including TCOs,CNTs, and nanowires,where there is a trade-off between optical transmittance and sheet resistance, making it a great challenge for these TCEs to obtain good optical and electrical properties simultaneously.

To evaluate the effect of mesh thickness on the overall performance of the TCEs,a figure of merit (FOM) was determined,which was the ratio of the electrical conductance and the optical conductance.The equation of DC/OPT is as follows:

$$
T = \left( 1 + \frac { 1 8 8 . 5 } { R } \frac { \sigma _ { \mathrm { o p t } } } { \sigma _ { \mathrm { d c } } } \right) ^ { - 2 }
$$

where $R$ and $T$ are the measured sheet resistance and transmittance at $5 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ,respectively.ThedataofanITO film from ref.30 are also listed for comparison. The FOM values for five Ag mesh films of 10,25,40,55 and $7 0 \mathrm { n m }$ are 20.5,44.5,96.7,143.2 and 194.7,respectively.A significant improvement was suggested with increasing film thickness,which resulted from the enhancement of electrical conductivity,over-compensating for the reduction in optical transparency.A high FOM is preferred for TCE applications,the maximum FOM of our $7 0 \mathrm { n m }$ Ag mesh is194.7,which is better than some of the best values for TCEs of PEDOT:PSS (36),3³ graphene (120), and metal nanowires (65- 160),'and is comparable to ITO films (175.5) and metal meshes (171).29

The haze values of different Ag mesh films are also measured and shown in Table1.The haze value is definedas the ratio of diffusive transmittance to total transmittance,with illumination from the glass side.The thicker the $\mathbf { A g }$ thickness,the higher the haze value.The haze value reached saturation after the Ag thickness was larger than $4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . Although the value was far less than that of $\mathbf { A g }$ nanowires reported in literature,a low haze value not larger than $1 \%$ is important to their application, especially for touch screen applications.

# 3.3Mechanical properties of Ag mesh films

Besides electrical and optical properties,mechanical stability of the TCE flm on a flexible substrate is also vital for its applications.To further evaluate the mechanical stability of the $\mathbf { A g }$ mesh transparent electrodes，a cyclic bending test and an adhesive tape test were performed.Fig. 4 shows the bending test. The original length of the $\mathbf { A g }$ mesh on PET is $L = 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ， the deformation of each cycle is $\mathrm { d } L = 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ,therefore,the bending radius is $R = 6 . 7 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ ,and strain is $\varepsilon = 1 . 0 \%$ according to $\varepsilon = h / 2 R$ (where $h$ is the whole thickness of the Ag mesh and PET,and $R$ is the bending radius?4).The same measurement was done on ITO coated PET as acomparison.As canbe seen in

![](images/e98fad950c5c54f77e51e88708595869b39731c44c82398cabec258472f68bcc.jpg)  
Fig.4Effect of repeated bending on the sheet resistance of the ITO and Ag mesh.SEM images of ITO (a) and Ag meshes (b) after 2000 bending cycles; (c) test setup of cyclic bending.

Fig.4,commercial ITO's resistance increased significantly and reached $1 2 0 0 . 0 \ \Omega$ after 2ooo bending cycles.Fig.4a shows the SEM image of the ITO film after 2ooo bending cycles.Some micro cracks developed perpendicular to the bending direction, which was due to the brittleness of the ITO film.The formation of these micro cracks lead to a deteriorative electrical conductivity during repeated deformation.In contrast, the changes in resistance of Ag mesh films were far less than that of the ITO film.The mechanical performance of the Ag mesh films was influenced by the film thickness.The $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ Ag mesh film showed an inferior performance after bending,which may be due to the small film thickness.Increasing the film thickness demonstrated an apparent improvement of stability (showed in Fig. $^ { S 2 \dagger }$ ).For the samples with a Ag thickness of $7 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，the change in resistance was less than $5 \%$ of its original value (from 10.0 to $1 0 . 2 \Omega$ )throughout 2ooo bending cycles.The SEMimage of the Ag mesh after 20oo bending cycles (Fig. 4b）also confirmed that the Ag mesh structure remained unchanged and no cracks could be observed.

The tape test was also conducted to evaluate the adhesion between the Ag mesh film and PET substrate.Fig.5 shows the changes in sheet resistance of Ag mesh films with different thicknesses during the repeated adhesive tape test. The adhesive properties improved with increasing Ag mesh film thickness.The inferior performance of the $1 0 \mathrm { n m }$ sample was due to the peeling off of the mesh film from the substrate in some part because of low thickness (as shown in Fig. S3t).The changes in the resistance value decreased and kept steady for thicker films.For the sample with the $7 0 \ \mathrm { n m } \ \mathrm { A g }$ film,the sheet resistance changed slightly $( < 5 \% )$ after1oo cycles,which is superior to Ag nanowire films.35 Both the bending test and tape test indicated that our Ag mesh electrodes demonstrate excellent flexibility and adhesion,as well as high optical and electrical properties,which may benefit their applications in optoelectronic devices.

# 3.4Performance of the PDLC device with Ag mesh electrodes

The PDLC device was fabricated to evaluate its performance with a $\mathbf { A g }$ mesh film as the electrode.The Ag mesh film with70 nm Ag thickness was chosen for device fabrication.A device using commercial PET/ITO film with almost the same sheet resistance value (& $3 \ \Omega \ \mathrm { s q } ^ { - 1 }$ ，brought from KDX Co.，Ltd.） was prepared at the same conditions for comparison.Conductive copper tape was stuck on each electrode for better contact. Fig.6a shows the specular transmittance-voltage curve of the PDLC devices at the wavelength of $5 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ using a Ag mesh film and an ITO film as electrodes,respectively. The device with the Ag mesh film as the electrode shows almost the same performance as that with the ITO electrode.The specular transmittance value is around zero when the voltage is below $2 0 ~ \mathrm { V }$ indicating an off state of the device.Alinear increase in transmittance with a steep slope between $3 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ and $_ { 7 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ can be observed.After that, the specular transmittance tends towards saturation with voltage increasing above $7 0 ~ \mathrm { V } .$ 、The maximum specular transmittance is $4 1 \%$ .In general, the driving voltage can be defined at the applied voltage ofan optical transmittance of $9 0 \%$ of the maximum value,36 thus the driving voltage in this device is around $8 0 \mathrm { V }$ The thickness of the cell gap of this device is $6 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ，which leads to a higher driving voltage and lower specular transmittance compared to deviceswithathinner cell gap.³7Fig. 6b and c show the photographic images of the device withAg mesh electrodesat off and on states,respectively.An AC voltage of $_ { 1 0 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ was selected as the on state voltage.In the off state,the device presents opaque color with good scattering properties.After applying voltage,the device became transparent with some milky color,indicating a relatively high haze value.The PDLC device with Ag mesh electrodes shows a high contrast ratio and uniformity in both on and off states.It indicates that the Ag mesh film can bea good substitute for the ITO electrode in a PDLC device and may find application in largearea flexible device fabrication.

# 4 Conclusions

We have demonstrated a hexagonal Ag mesh transparent conductive electrode onaPET flexible substrate.The Ag mesh is patterned by photolithography with a fixed line width of $4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and periodicity of $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ . Five different Ag mesh films were prepared with thicknesses from $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ to $7 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .All samples showed a high optical transmittance of ${ > } 8 0 \%$ as well asa good conductivity of $8 ~ \Omega ~ \mathrm { s q } ^ { - 1 }$ at a film thickness of $7 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ . This can be used to change the optical transmittance and electrical resistance independently by adjusting the film thickness,line width and periodicity.The Ag mesh produced using photolithography and magnetic sputtering on a flexible substrate also showed an excellent stability in terms of adhesion and bending. Furthermore,this Ag mesh electrode can be a good electrode candidate for a PDLC device with a high contrast ratio and uniformity at both on and off states.
