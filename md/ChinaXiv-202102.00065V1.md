Abstract: The Karakoram Mountains are well known for their widespread surge-type glaciers and slight glacier mass gains. On the one hand, glaciers are one of the sensitive indicators of climate change,their area and thickness will adjust with climate change. On the other hand,glaciers provide freshwater resources for agricultural irrgation and hydroelectric generation in the downstream areas of the Shaksgam River Basin (SRB) in western China. The shrinkage of glaciers caused by climate change can significantly affect the security and sustainable development of regional water resources.In this study, we analyzed the changes in glacier area from 20OO to 2016 in the SRB using Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper)/ $\mathrm { { { E T M + } } }$ (Enhanced Mapper Plus)/OLI(Operational Land Imager) images.It is shown that the SRB contained 472 glaciers, with an area of $1 8 4 0 . 3 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ,in 2016.The glacier area decreased by $0 . 1 4 \% / \mathrm { a }$ since 2000,and the shrinkage of glacier in the southeast, east and south directions were the most, while the northeast, north directions were the least. Debris-covered area accounted for $8 . 0 \%$ of the total glacier area. We estimated elevation and mass changes using the 1 arc-second SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) (2OoO) and the resolution of $8 \mathrm { m H M A }$ (High Mountain Asia) DEM (2016).An average thickness of $0 . 0 8 \ ( \pm 0 . 0 3 ) \ \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { a }$ ，or a slight mass increase of 0.06 $( \pm 0 . 0 2 )$ m w.e./a has been obtained since 2Ooo.We found thinning was significantly lesser on the clean ice than the debris-covered ice.In addition,the elevation of glacier surface is spatially heterogeneous, showing that the accumulation of mass is dominant in high altitude regions, and the main mass lossis in low altitude regions, excluding the surge-type glacier. For surge-type glaciers, the mass may transfer from the reservoir to the receiving area rapidly when surges,then resulting in an advance of glacier terminus. The main surge mechanism is still unclear,it is worth noting that the surge did not increase the glacier massin this study.

# 1 Introduction

Glacier mass balance plays a prominent role in the study of the impact of climate change on glaciers and the response of glaciers to climate change. The local climate determines the supply and loss of mass and energy on the glacier surface and thus determines the mass balance of the glacier. Measurements of the glacier mass balance began in the Alps and Scandinavia in the 1940s.In China,mass-balance measurements began in 1959 with the establishment of the Tianshan Glaciological Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences. To date, the continuous mass balance series,Urumqi Glacier No.1, Qiyi Glacier and Dongkemadi Glacier,are longer than 20 years in China (Wang et al.,2010; Yao et al., 2012;Wang et al.,2013,2020). The traditional glaciological method uses stakes or snow pits, which can obtain the mass balance at a single point by measuring the changes in the height of the stakes and the characteristics of the snow pits,and the point values can be extrapolated to the whole glacier to generate the glacier-wide mass balance (Pu et al., 2Oo8). Glaciological mass balance is highly accurate; however, glaciers are usually located in uninhabited high mountains,and measuring stakes or snow pits is time-consuming and laborious,and the cost is too high. Therefore,the number of glaciers monitored by this method is very limited,and traditional methods have limitations in solving the glacier mass balance at the basin scale.With the gradual enrichment of remote sensing data for detecting glacial properties，research on glacier changes through remote sensing data has flourished.

The Karakoram Mountains have a large ice volume,and glacier meltwater provides freshwater for many important inland rivers (e.g.,the Yarkant River and Hetian River, both of which are the upper source of the Tarim River),which representing an important part of water resources in western China. According to the fifth report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the average surface air temperature of the Earth has increased by $0 . 8 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ over the past 100 years (1901-2012) (IPCC,2013). Climate warming accelerates the melting of glaciers, which not only threatens the production and life of local people but also affects the rise of sea level (Radic and Hock,2O11; Käab et al.,2012). In the context of global warming,most of the world's glaciers have suffered mass losses.However, many studies have shown that the glaciers in Karakoram Mountains have experienced a balanced or slightly positive trend over the past decade (Gardelle et al.,2012a; Käab et al.,2012; Berthier et al.,2019), which may be fostered stable or advancing glacier termini (Bolch et al., 2012; Rankl et al.,2014; Bhambri et al.,2017).This phenomenon is called the "Karakoram Anomaly" (Hewitt, 2005).

Gardelle et al.(2O12a） found that glacier mass balance of 0.11 $( \pm 0 . 2 2 ) \textrm { m w } \mathrm { e } . / \mathrm { a }$ for the Karakoram Mountains (glacier area is $5 6 1 5 . 0 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ during 200O-2008 using SRTM(Shuttle Radar Topography Mission） DEM (Digital Elevation Model） and SPOT5 stereo image pair data (density: $\dot { 9 0 0 } ~ \mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 3 } .$ ).Käab et al.(2O12) further confirmed that glacier mass balance of $- 0 . 0 6$ $( \pm 0 . 0 4 )$ m w.e./a (glacier area is $2 1 , 7 5 0 . 0 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } ,$ during 2003-2008 by using ICESat laser altimetry (using a density of $\mathrm { 9 0 0 k g / m } ^ { 3 } \mathrm { \cdot }$ ),and Rankl and Braun (2O16) proved that glacier mass balance of - 0.08 $( \pm 0 . 1 0 )$ m w.e./a (glacier area is $1 1 0 7 . 0 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } ; \quad$ ）for the period 2000-2012 using ice surface elevations of TanDEM-X and SRTM/X-SAR DEM (using a density of $8 5 0 ~ \mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 3 }$ ). Another study using ICESat (Kaab et al.,2015) and ASTER DEMs from 2000 to 2016 (Brun et al.,2017) has shown that the Karakoram Mountains is located on the western edge of the West Kunlun Mountains,which is a larger mass-balance anomaly,the western Tibetan Plateau. These results indicate that glaciers in the Karakoram Mountains have experienced a stable state although the values slightlydifferent each other.

To overcome the scarcity of existing data sets, we updated the boundary data of glaciers in the SRB (Shaksgam River Basin) from 200O to 2016.A geodetic method,based on a DEM difference of SRTM and HMA data,was used to determined changes in glacier mass balance during different periods.The function of debris cover in glacier mass changes was understood. Finally, combined with previous studies, discussed and analyzed the characteristics of surge-type glaciers and the climate factors of glacier changes.

# 2 Study area

The SRB $( 3 5 ^ { \circ } 5 5 ^ { \prime } - 3 6 ^ { \circ } 4 9 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ ， $7 5 ^ { \circ } 3 5 ^ { \prime }  – 7 7 ^ { \circ } 3 0 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ ,on the northern slope of the Karakoram Mountains, is in western China (Fig.1). The Shaksgam River,the main river in the SRB,originates from the Karakoram Mountains in Shenglinandaban and flows into the Yarkant River at Cha Hekou. The river course starts from the east-west direction, gradually changes to southeast after $3 0 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ ，and finally turns to the east-west direction in the last $4 0 \mathrm { k m }$ (Wang et al., 1989). This area is the upper Source area of the Tarim River and is also known as "the Karakoram Corridor". The whole valley runs from southeast to northwest,with an average altitude of approximately $5 1 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ a.s.l. The world's second-highest peak, Mount Qogir (K2), is its main peak, with an altitude of $8 6 1 1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ a.s.1.

The SRB is mainly controlled by a continental climate.According to the Chinese Second Glacier Inventory, the SRB contains 491 glaciers (in this paper, some small glaciers are removed) with a total area of $1 8 8 4 . 2 ~ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ . The most densely developed glacier area is Karakoram Mountains, China. Eight glaciers have areas less than $7 \dot { 0 } . 0 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ，which account for $5 5 \%$ of the total glacier area in the study area. The Yengisogat Glacier has an area of $3 5 9 . 1 ~ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ and a length of $4 2 \ \mathrm { k m }$ and is the largest and longest glacier in China (Liu et al.,2O15; Jiang et al.,2O2O).Due to the high altitude and low air temperature, measurement data are scarce. The Karakoram Mountains have a high altitude and steep terrain. Due to the interception of water and air by the high mountains and the role of storage in the mountains,there is more precipitation in the high-altitude areas than in the low altitude areas,which provides rich mass sources for the formation of glaciers and thus develops the largest and most concentrated glacier group in the middle latitudes (Xu et al., 2016).

# 3 Data

# 3.1 Landsat data

Landsat images (Table 1） were used to analyze glacier area changes in the SRB,including Landsat TM/ETM $^ +$ /OLI.EightLandsat TM/ETM $\cdot +$ /OLI images with good quality were used in this study, which were downloaded from the website of USGS (United States Geological Survey; htps://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). All scenes are from the USGS and are orthorectified with SRTM and ground control points from the GLS2OO5 (Global Land Survey 2Oo5） data set， having achieved systematic radiometric and geometric accuracy. Due to the long-time span，high resolution and free download of Landsat data, it has been widely used in glacier remote sensing research (Paul, 2002; Bolch et al., 2010).

# 3.2Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)

# 3.2.1 SRTMDEM

The SRTM acquired interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data simultaneously in both the C-band and X-band frequencies from 11 to 22 February 200O (Farr et al., 2007). Data were acquired between $5 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { S }$ and $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { N } .$ ,accounting for $80 \%$ of the global land surface (Zyl, 2OO1). The 1 arc-second $( 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m } )$ SRTM C-band, with linear vertical absolute height error of less than $1 6 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ and linear vertical relative height error of less than $1 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (at $90 \%$ confidence level). The SRTM DEM can be referred to the glacier surface in the last balance year (1999), with slight seasonal variation (Gardelle et al.,2O13).The C-band exhibits some penetration of ice and snow, while the X-band exhibits less penetration.However, because the width of the X-band $( 5 0 \mathrm { k m } )$ is less than that of the C-band $( 2 2 5 ~ \mathrm { k m } )$ (Farr et al., 2007)，only $3 5 \%$ of the SRB glaciers are covered by X-band DEM. Low signal, signal-to-noise ratio etc.resulting in voids in the SRTM DEM data, but only $4 \%$ of the total glacier area was in the study. Hence,in this study, the 1 arc-second, non-void-filled SRTM C-band DEM was used to estimate the changes in glacier surface elevation after the 1999 ablation period. The data are available free from http://arthexplorer.usgs.gov/.

# 3.2.2 HMADEM

The DEMs were generated from high-resolution along-and cross-track stereo images from DigitalGlobe satellites,with a resolution of $8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ，which were collected from 28 January 2002 to 24 November 2016.The HMA DEM is composed of more than 40OO strips with a width of 13.1 km and a length of $1 7 . 4 \mathrm { k m }$ ,which reduces errors and eliminates seams.In this study,six images 1 $( 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k m } { \times } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k m } )$ were collected during 2015-2016.HMA DEM can be referred to the glacier surface in the last balance year (2O16)，and the data were downloaded free from https://nsidc.org/data/HMA_DEM8m_MOS/versions/1. Although HMA DEM suffers from data voids,otherwise of very high quality (Fig.2),and the data voids only $5 \%$ of the total glacier area.

# 4 Methodology

# 4.1 Glacier boundary delineation

Information on glacier boundaries is necessary to obtain changes in glacier mass balance. We selected the scenes during the ablation season (from June to September, mainly in August) to minimize the impact of snow cover and comprehensively considered the time,cloud proportion (Table 1). Seasonal snow and clouds can be distinguished by comparing images of the glacier body from neighboring years.

Because of its simplicity and accuracy, the band ratio is the most suitable method to extract glacier boundary (Albert, 2OO2; Paul et al., 2O15).We use the method of band ratio threshold (TM3/TM5 for $\mathrm { T M / E T M + }$ and TM4/TM6 for OLI),with a threshold of 1.9 chosen for this task. The principle is to divide the surface object into glacierized and non-glacierized area by using the strong reflectivity of glaciers in the visible light band and the strong absorption in the near-infrared band.This method may mistake proglacial lakes for glaciers (Pan et al.,2012). Visual interpretation can easily correct this error. The surfaces of glaciers in the study area are covered by debris and supraglacial boulders，and the identification of these features is time-consuming and important work in later editing. There are several principles for distinguishing debris-covered glaciers.For example, Kaab (2Oo5) suggested that areas with slopes lower than the threshold $( 2 3 ^ { \circ } )$ and directly connected to clean ice can be considered ice covered by debris.The colour of the surface moraine on the glacier is different from that of the debris on the outer edge of the glacier. The supraglacial boulders throughout a glacier tongue have the same spectral characteristics. With the increase in air temperature,the shape of the glacier tongue obviously decreases，which can be identified. Therefore,the above principles can be used to identify supraglacial boulders and debris-covered ice. At the same time, the process of extracting glacier information also refers to the second Chineseglacier inventory (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn/) and Google Earth.

Although we have made extensive efforts to improve the accuracy of extracted glacier boundaries,errors stillexist for various reasons.A certain degree of error assessment is needed.In this paper,the method proposed by Jin et al. (2OO5) is used to evaluate the error of the glacier boundaries.First, the buffer zone of the glacier boundary extracted from TM, $\mathbf { \mathrm { E T M + } }$ and OLI images are analyzed (taking half of the resolution of the remote sensing image as the buffer distance; thus,TM, $\mathrm { E T M + }$ and OLI images have a buffer distance of $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m }$ ).Then,the glacierarea in the buffer zone is differentiated from the glacier area extracted from the original image,and the ratio between the result and the latter is the uncertainty of the glacier area extraction. The results showed that the uncertainty values of the extracted glacier boundaries in 2OoO and 2O16 were $\pm 3 . 7 2 \%$ and $\pm 3 . 5 4 \%$ ,respectively,which were both within the range of previous research results (He and Yang, 2014).

# 4.2 Geodetic mass balance calculations

We use the geodetic method to obtain the glacier surface elevation changes by comparing the DEM data from different periods and then to estimate the glacier mass balance by combining the area and density of glaciers (Thibert et al.,2OO8;Fischer, 2011).

$$
B { = } \frac { \rho } { S _ { g } } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { M } \Delta h _ { i } S _ { P } ,
$$

where $B$ is the glacier mass balance (m w.e.); $\rho$ is the ice density $( \mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 3 } )$ ： $S _ { g }$ is the glacier area $( \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } )$ ， $M$ is the number of pixels contained in the glacier boundary; $\Delta { h } _ { \mathrm { i } }$ is the glacier surface elevation difference $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { m } )$ ; and $S _ { p }$ is the pixel size $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ , that is, the spatial resolution of the DEM data.

# 4.3Co-registration and correction of DEMs

Due to the differences in DEM acquisition, geodetic reference planes and processing methods, horizontal and vertical shifts might exist between the SRTM DEMand the HMA DEM.Any small horizontal shift will cause obvious DEM elevation errors in the mountain area. However,before estimating the elevation changes of the glacier surface,the relative registration of each DEM data is needed. Here,we used the method proposed by Nuth and Kääb (2O11). Research shows that there is a cosine-curved obvious relationship between elevation difference,aspect and slope (Kääb，2Oo5）(Fig.3a)，based on the relationship relative vertical and horizontal distortions between the SRTM DEM and HMA DEM was corrected statistically (Nuth and Käab,2011). Based on the SRTM DEM, the spatial resolution of the HMA DEM was resampled to $3 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ Under the support of ArcGIS 10.2.2 software,a difference map was built with the SRTM C-band DEM and HMA DEM. On the basis of statistical analysis, $5 \%$ and $9 5 \%$ quantile thresholds are used to eliminate outliers DEM edges and near data gaps (Pieczonka and Bolch,2O15). Based on cosine fiting,we obtained the translation vector, and then the HMA DEM was moved to achieve image registration. The calculation is as follows (Eqs. 2-6).In addition,based on the relationship between the elevation diference and the maximum curvature in non-glacier regions (Fig. 3b), the deviation,caused by the different spatial resolution of the two datasets,were refined for both glacier and non-glacier regions (Gardelle et al.,2O12b). Before adjustment, the average elevation difference and standard deviation of the non-glacier regions were $- 1 9 . 8 3$ and $1 4 . 9 1 ~ \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ respectively. After these adjustments,the elevation difference in the non-glacier regions was focused on the average elevation difference at $- 0 . 3 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ,and the standard deviation was reduced to $1 1 . 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ，After these corrections,the non-glacier regions had stabilized,which makes the DEMs suitable for estimating the change of glacier mass balance.

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { \displaystyle \frac { d h } { \tan \left( \alpha \right) } = a \times \cos \left( b - \varphi \right) + c , \hfill } } \\ { { \displaystyle c = \frac { \overline { { { d h } } } } { \tan \left( \overline { { { \alpha } } } \right) } , \hfill } } \end{array}
$$

where $d h$ is the individual elevation difference $( \mathrm { m } ) ; \alpha$ and $\varphi$ represent the slope and aspect of the pixel ${ \bf \Xi } ^ { ( \circ } )$ ,respectively; $\overline { { d h } }$ is the overall elevation bias between the SRTMDEM and HMADEM (m),representing the vertical offset; $a$ is the magnitude of the horizontal shift (m); $b$ is the direction of the shift vector ${ \binom { \circ } { \hbar } } ; c$ is the mean bias between the DEMs divided by the mean slope tangent $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ ,and $\overset { - } { \alpha }$ is the average slope of the DEM data ${ \bf \Xi } ^ { ( \circ } )$

The offset in the $x$ (m), $y$ (m) and z (m) directions between the two DEMs can be calculated by the following formulas:

$$
{ \begin{array} { r l } & { x = a \times \sin \left( b \right) , } \\ & { y = a \times \cos \left( b \right) , } \\ & { z = c \times \tan \left( { \overline { { \alpha } } } \right) , } \end{array} }
$$

where $a$ $b$ and $c$ can be obtained by cosine fitting

# 4.4 Uncertainty assessment

# 4.4.1 Evaluation of elevation change uncertainty

The root mean square error or standard deviation of the elevation residuals between different DEMs in the area away from a glacier can estimate the uncertainty of the elevation changes (Bolch et al., 2011).

$$
E _ { \sigma } = \frac { \mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { n o \ g l a c } } } { \sqrt { N } } ,
$$

$$
E = \sqrt { E _ { m } ^ { 2 } + E _ { \sigma } ^ { 2 } } \ ,
$$

where $E _ { \sigma }$ is the average elevation bias of off glaciers $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ ， $\mathrm { S D } _ { \mathrm { n o \ g l a c } }$ is the standard deviation in the non-glacial areas $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ ： $N$ is the number of measurement points; $E _ { m }$ is the average elevation difference in non-glacier areas $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ ; and $E$ is the error of elevation change $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ ：

In order to calculate $E _ { \sigma }$ for a reasonable number of pixels near the glacier, we only used the pixels in the $5 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ buffer zone around the glacier. Note that the DEM exhibits strong spatial autocorrelation in the elevation values of adjacent grids. To reduce the influence of autocorrelation,a decorrelation length based on the spatial resolution is suggested.For DEMs with a spatial resolution of $3 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ， $6 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ is suitable as the decorrelation length (Koblet et al., 2010).

# 4.4.2 Effect of SRTM penetration

The SRTM C-band $( 5 . 7 \mathrm { G H z } )$ exhibits some penetration of ice and snow with a penetration depth between 1 and $1 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (Rignot et al., 2OO1). The penetration of the SRTM X-band $( 9 . 7 ~ \mathrm { G H z } )$ is expected to be low compared to that of the C-band (a hypothesis that still needs to be confirmed (Ulaby et al.,1986), we consider the elevation difference (SRTM C-band-SRTM X-band) to be the first approximation of C-band radar penetration over glaciers (Gardelle et al., 2O12b).Here, we estimate this penetration by differencing the SRTM C-band and X-band DEMs. The X-band and C-band are acquired simultaneously. There is no elevation change caused by ablation or accumulation (Gardelle et al.，2012b,2013； Shangguan et al.， 2015).Before estimating the penetration depth of the SRTM C-band, the SRTM X DEM and C DEM were co-registered and corrected. The final mean SRTM C-band penetration depth over the SRB was approximately 2.8 m, which is consistent with the results of Gardelle et al. (2Ol3),who reported a penetration depth of $3 . 4 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$

# 4.4.3 Density assumption error

The conversion from ice volume to mass is an important part when estimating glacier mass changes using the geodetic method (Huss,2Ol3). The glacier density must be considered to convert glacier elevation change to a mass balance change. Fresh snow, firn and ice exhibit large differences in density,and the density of glaciers varies,ranging from 100 to $9 1 7 ~ \mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 3 }$ (Fischer, 2011). The density parameter value will produce $5 \% - 6 \%$ uncertainty in the glacier scale mass balance estimation results (Elsberg et al., 2Oo1).In the Karakoram Mountains, it is assumed that the parameters used to convert the glacier elevation change into mass changes follow Sorge's law (Bader, 1954), that is, glacier density remains constant in the vertical direction, $9 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k g / m ^ { 3 } }$ is used as the density conversion parameter, and the estimated mass balance was 0.11 $( \pm 0 . 2 2 )$ m w.e./a during 1999-2Oo8.If the glacial density in the accumulation zone is assumed to be $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 3 }$ ,the mass balance drops to 0. $) 5 \ ( \pm 0 . 1 6 ) \textrm { m w . e . } / \mathrm { a }$ , and both extreme density scenarios did not change the result of the proximity of the glacier area.In this study,a density of $8 5 0 ~ \mathrm { k g / m } ^ { 3 }$ ，with an uncertainty of $6 0 \mathrm { \dot { k } g / m } ^ { 3 }$ , was used as the volume-to-mass conversion parameter.

# 4.4.4Accuracy of the glacier boundary

The uncertainty of the glacier area refers to the error caused by the differences in $S _ { g }$ and $M$ in Equation 1, which is used to estimate the mass balance.To reduce this error, when calculating the changes in glacier volume,the maximum glacier area after the fusion of two periods can be taken;

when calculating the mass balance of glaciers,the union value of the glacier boundary from two periods can be taken (Gardelle et al., 2012b,2013; Pieczonka et al.,2013).We finally obtained glacier areas in 2000 and 2016 of 1884.2 and $1 8 4 0 . { \dot { 3 } } \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ,respectively.

# 4.4.5 Uncertainty of mass balance

The final mass balance uncertainty was determined using the estimated uncertainties of glacier area and elevation changes,and the glacier density uncertainty was $6 0 ~ \mathrm { k g / m ^ { 3 } }$ ：

$$

# 5 Results

# 5.1 Area changes

There were 472 glaciers with a total area of $1 8 4 0 . 3 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ in 2016 in the SRB (Fig. 4). In terms of area, large glaciers $( \geq 1 ~ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ,occupy $9 4 . 3 \%$ of the total area) are dominant, while small glaciers （204 $( < 1 . 0 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { - } )$ ，occupy $7 0 . 6 \%$ of the total number) are dominant in number (Fig. 4a).The glacier surface slope in the SRB is approximately in the $1 6 ^ { \circ } - 3 4 ^ { \circ }$ range, accounting for $9 5 . 6 \%$ of the total glacier area. Glaciers having a north, northeast, northwest or east aspects account for $6 3 . 2 \%$ of the total area.The shrank of the glacier on the southeast, east and south aspects were the most, while those on the west, northeast and north aspects were the least (Fig. 4b).

The glaciers were significantly debris covered in the SRB and the distribution of debris-covered glaciers is shown in Figure 1. The total debris-covered area was $1 4 6 . 5 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$

Among all debris-covered glaciers, there were 2O glaciers with debris-covered areas larger than $1 . 0 \mathrm { ~ k m } ^ { - 2 }$ . Yengisogat Glacier has the most debris cover in the SRB $( 3 2 . 9 ~ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ，about $9 . 3 \%$ of its area).About $8 6 . 2 \%$ of the debris-covered area is in the 42OO and $5 2 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ altitude range, $1 0 . 7 \%$ is higher than $5 2 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ ,and only $3 . 1 \%$ is below $4 2 0 0 \mathrm { m }$

Comparing the area of glaciers in 2OoO with that in 2O16,the reduction in glacier area was 43.9 $\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ，with an annual average shrinkage rate of $0 . 1 4 \% \mathrm { / a }$ .Small glaciers shrink significantly, however,the area loss of large glaciers is dominant in absolute area loss (Fig. 4c). Approximately $91 . 5 \%$ of the total glacier area is found from 4400 to $6 3 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ，while only $1 . 6 \%$ is below $4 4 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ and $6 . 2 \%$ above $6 3 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ . The median elevation is about $5 6 8 2 \mathrm { m }$ (Fig. 4d). The glacier topography analysis shows that the glacier area below $4 0 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ had disappeared completely, with an area of $0 . 3 \mathrm { ~ } \mathrm { \check { k } m } ^ { 2 }$ . Glaciers at low altitudes disappeared,and glaciers at high altitudes change very little and without disintegration,causing the decrease of the total number of glaciers. Glaciers in the SRB have experienced weakening area shrinkage from 2OoO to 2016.

# 5.2 Elevation and mass changes

The glaciers in the SRB appear to show a weak surface thickening from 20OO to 2016. Glaciers, with an area of $1 8 6 2 . 3 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ (the union of the 2OoO and 2016 glacier extents)，experienced a thickening of 1.21 $( \pm 0 . 4 1 )$ $\mathrm { ~ m ~ } ( 0 . 0 8 ~ ( \pm 0 . 0 3 ) ~ \mathrm { m / a } )$ . Using 85 $\mathrm { ~ 0 ~ } ( \pm 6 0 ) \mathrm { ~ k g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ as the density parameter, glacier mass gain of $0 . 0 6 ( \pm 0 . 0 2 ) \mathrm { ~ m ~ w . e . / a . }$ The distribution of glacier surface mass is uneven (Fig. 5), which shows that the accumulation of mass is dominant in high altitude regions,and the loss of mass in low altitude regions (excluding the surge glacier). Yengisogat Glacier is typical. There are obvious glacier thickening phenomena in the upper reaches of the North ice flow (A in Fig.5a), the upper reaches of the northwest ice flow (B in Fig.5a),and the middle part of the main stream (C in Fig. 5a).

# 6 Discussion

# 6.1 Comparison with previous study

Previous studies agreed that the mass balance of glaciers in the Karakoram Mountains has maintained a weak increase or stable state since 2Ooo (Table.3). Based on SRTM and SPOT5 DEMs,a thickening of $0 . 1 2 \ ( \pm 0 . 1 9 ) \ \mathrm { m / a }$ was found from 2000 to 2011 by Gardelle et al. (2013). Whereas a thinning of $0 . 0 9 \ ( \pm 0 . 1 2 ) \ \mathrm { m / a }$ between 200O and 2012 was reported over the Karakoram by Rankl and Braun (2O16)，using Tan DEM_X and SRTM/X_ASR. And a thinning of 0.07 $\mathrm { { ( \pm 0 . 0 4 ) \ m / a } }$ (2003-2O08) was found in the Karakoram by Käab et al. (2012),using SRTM and ICESat.In this study, SRTM and HMA DEMs acquisitions a mean thickening of 0.08 $\left( \pm 0 . 0 3 \right) \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { a }$ （204号 between 20oO and 2O16. This positive trend agrees with the results of Gardelle et al.(2013) but has slight differences from the results (a weak negative trend) of Käab et al. (2O12),and Rankl and Braun (2O16). Different estimates of SRTM C-band penetration result in different thicknesses with those determined by Käab et al. (2O12).A mean SRTM C-band penetration of $2 . 4 \ ( \pm 0 . 3 ) \ \mathrm { m }$ was used for the Karakoram Mountains (Kääb et al.,2O12), less than $3 . 0 \mathrm { { m } }$ (snow and ice), $8 . 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (accumulation areas） and an average penetration of $3 . 4 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in the central Karakoram Mountains (Gardelle et al.，2012a，2013） and $2 . 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ assumed in this study. The Karakoram Mountains is located at the west end of the Himalayan arc, stretching for thousands of kilometers,containing around $1 9 , 9 5 0 . 0 ~ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ of glaciers (Cogley, 2O11). The characteristics of glaciers in the eastern, western and central Karakoram Mountains are different.The study area of Gardelle et al.(2013) is mainly concentrated in the central Karakoram, while the study area of Kaab et al. (2Ol2) covers the whole Karakoram Mountains,our study area is mainly located at the eastern and central Karakoram Mountains. In addition, the differences in DEMs,the density of snow ice and glacier boundaries may explain part of these discrepancies. Previous studies estimated an average penetration depth of $2 . 7 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in the Karakoram Mountains (Zhou et al.,2017), $2 . 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in West Kunlun Mountains, $1 . 9 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in Pamir (Lin et al., 2017), $3 . 5 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in the Hindu Kush and $2 . 0 { - } 3 . 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ in the Karakoram Mountains (Chen et al.,2O18).In this study, the penetration depth was $2 . 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ,in agreement with previous studies,which was considered acceptable and suitable for estimating glacier elevation changes in the SRB. However, these studies suggested that the average changes in glacier surface elevation of the Karakoram Mountains are certainly relatively small, even the glaciers have experienced a stable status in the Karakoram Mountains.

# 6.2 Debris-coveredice andcleanice

The debris-covered areas account for about $8 . 0 \%$ of the total glacier (Fig. 6a). Ice cliffs, heterogeneous debris cover and supraglacial lakes could be the contributing factors to the complexity of the mass-loss paterns of debris-covered tongues (Pellicciotti et al.,2015). Although it is generally believed that a thick debris cover willact as a protective layer for glaciers due to its insulation (Benn et al., 2OoO), previous studies have reported that it will accelerate when the thickness of debris cover is smaller than a critical value (Ye et al.,2O15; Zhang et al., 2016).In this study,the debris cover has a positive influence on the ablation,and we found that melt was noticeably smaller on the clean ice than the debris-covered ice in the altitude 4000-5900 m, during 2000-2016 (-0.63 $( \pm 0 . 0 3 )$ vs 0.13 $( \pm 0 . 0 3 ) \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { a } )$ (Fig.6b).Previous studies have found similar results in the Karakoram Mountains (Gardelle et al., 2O12a), the eastern Pamir (Zhang et al., 2016),and the central Nyainqentanglha Range (Wu et al., 2019).

# 6.3 Surge-type glaciers

According to previous studies,at least 12 places surged in this basin (Fig. 5). Among the 12 places,most surges occurred between 2000 and 2016 (Quincey et al.,2015; Bhambri et al., 2017), and one of them (C position in Figure 5a) occurred during 2011-2016.During 1999-2011, the C position was defined with dashed black box in a post-surge or quiescent phase.Here,we found that an obvious thickening occurred at the C position,at the same time,there was obvious thinning in the upper reaches (below the A and B in Figure 5a),which is consistent with the characteristics of surge-type glaciers. In this study,we can't determine the specific time of the glacier surged here.However,according to the reported study, it is indicated that the C position (Fig. 5) of Yengisogat Glacier has a faster movement velocity of $9 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m / a } }$ from June to August 2012. Then,the glacier movement velocity decreased rapidly,that is, from June to August 2012, it may be at the peak of the surge phase (Quincey et al., 2015).

Most of the glaciers either have stable termini locations or have been advancing,partly as a result of increased local precipitation (Janes et al.,2Ol2) and partly due to glacier surging (Paul, 2015) in the Karakoram Mountains. Here,the glacier surging did not increase the glacier mass. Generally,the rapid transfer of mass to the receiving area resulted in an advance of the glacier termini, but it was not always. Although some characteristics of the Karakoram glacier surges are similar to thermally controlled surges of other places (such as Svalbard),，the main surge mechanism is still unclear (Quincey et al., 2015).

# 6.4Analysis of the factors of glacier anomaly

Glaciers are a comprehensive product of climate, topography and other factors. Since the terrain has not changed in recent decades or even hundreds of years, glaciers are sensitive to climate change (Shi， 2Ooo). Some potential explanations, such as cloud cover，precipitation and temperature can be found in the current studies,which may be driving factors of the Karakoram glacier changes. Based on the global meteorological reanalysis data and meteorological station data,Forsythe et al. (2O15)and Bashir et al. (2O17) have reported that an increase of cloudiness in the Karakoram Mountains.The increase of cloud cover may reduce the incoming shortwave radiation (Forsythe et al.,2O15). However, incoming shortwave radiation is generally considered to be the main energy source of glacier mass changes (Forsythe et al., 2O15). In addition, previous studies have reported that increased cloud cover leads to increase in precipitation (Forsythe et al., 2015; Bashir et al., 2O17). The climate of Karakoram is mainly influenced by westerly circulation and Tibetan anticyclone (Archer and Fowler， 2O04).Cannon et al. (2O15） reported that the frequency and intensity of such precipitation by westerlies-dominated have increased in recent years,which seems to lead to a slight increase in winter snowfall in Karakoram (Norris et al., 2019). In turn, precipitation change is considered to be a powerful control on glacier mass balance in the Karakoram Mountains (Kapnick et al., 2014; Forsythe et al., 2017). Moreover, in recent decades,summer cooling has been a particularly important driving factor for the mass balance of glaciers in the Karakoram Mountains (Fowler et al.,201O; Forsythe et al.，2O17).It is worth noting that the tree-ring chronology did not provide any evidence that the temperature of the Karakoram Mountains is not consistent with the rest regions in High Mountain Asia.

# 7 Conclusions

This paper takes the glaciers in the SRBas the research object,and the glacier boundaries in 2000 and 2016 were extracted according to Landsat $\mathrm { T M / E T M + / O L I }$ images.Based on HMA DEM and SRTM DEM data,changes in surface elevation and mass balance in this study have been estimated from 200O to 2016.

We found that the SRB contained 472 glaciers, with a total glacier area of $1 8 4 0 . 3 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ in 2016. The reduction in glacier area was $4 3 . 9 \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ with an annual average shrinkage rate of $0 . 1 4 \% / \mathrm { a }$ ,and glacier area mainly decreased in the southeast,east and south directions,during 2Ooo-2016. Compared with the melt of mountain glaciers in western China, even global, the glaciers in the SRB have experienced a slight shrinkage. In addition, the debris-covered area was $1 4 6 . 5 \ \mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ accounting for about $8 . 0 \%$ of the total area.

The glacier thickness showed a weak increasing trend, with a thickening value of 0.08 $( \pm 0 . 0 3 )$ （20 $\mathrm { { m } / \mathrm { { a } } }$ ，or $0 . 0 6 \ ( \pm 0 . 0 2 ) \ \mathrm { m \ w . e . / a }$ .The thinning value was significantly greater on the debris-covered ice than the clean ice in the altitude $4 0 0 0 { - } 5 9 0 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ ，between 200O and 2016 in the SRB $( - 0 . 6 3$ $_ { ( \pm 0 . 0 3 ) }$ vS $0 . 1 3 \ \mathrm { ( \pm 0 . 0 3 ) \ m / a ) }$ . Research result shows that the glacier mass was rapidly transferring from the reservoir to the receiving area,resulting in an advance of the glacier termini, but not always.
