The homeostasis of magnesium $( \mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + } )$ ,an abundant divalent cation indispensable for many biological processes including mitochondrial functions, is underexplored.Previously,two mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ importers,Mrs2 and Lpe10,were characterized for mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ uptake.We now show that mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis is accurately controlled through the combined effects of previously known importers and a novel exporter, Mme1 (mitochondrial magnesium exporter1).Mme1 belongs to the mitochondrial carrer family and was isolated for its mutation that is able to suppress the $m r s 2 \Delta$ respiration defect. Deletion of MME1 significantly increased steady-state mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ concentration,while overexpression decreased it.Measurements of $\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } }$ exit from proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified Mme1 provided definite evidence for Mme1 as an $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.Our studies identified,for the first time,a mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter that works together with mitochondrial importers to ensure the precise control of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis.

# 1. Introduction

Magnesium $( \mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + } )$ is a major intracellular divalent cation in living cells.As a critical co-factor for hundreds of enzymes, $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ has been known to participate in over 3oo metabolic reactions,including but not limited to energy production,ion metabolism,and cell cycle regulation [1]. $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ also plays an important role in sustaining genomic stabilityand preventing carcinogenicity[2].Therefore,it is quite apprehensible that alterations in $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ metabolism would correlate to many important human diseases [3],including metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension [4]. In higher plants, $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ also playsa critical role in regulating the chloroplastmRNA stability[5].

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been proved to bean excellent model organism for the study of many fundamental biological processes, including the mechanism of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport. Up to now,three types of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transporters have been identified in yeast-the Alr $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport system in the cell plasma membrane,the Mnr2 $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transporter in the vacuolar membrane,and the Mrs2/Lpe10 $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane.

The two Alr proteins (Alr1 and Alr2) are orthologues of the bacterial CorA transporter,sharing with the lattera highly conserved GMN motif [6]. Both Alr1 and Alr2 localize in the plasma membrane and function as $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ uptakers [6,7].

In vacuoles,storage sites for $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ within yeast cells,a $\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } / H ^ { + } }$ exchange mechanism was discovered to drive $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ entry into the organelles [8]. On the other hand,Mnr2 (manganese resistance 2)-a vacuolar membrane protein that functions as a putative $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transporter and shares similarities with Alr1 and Alr2-is responsible for $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux from vacuoles.Genetic evidence shows that this protein functions by releasing $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ into the cytosol under $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -deficient conditions [9].

Besides vacuoles,mitochondria serve as another intracellular $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ pool.Two mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transporters,Mrs2 and Lpe10,were reported to be responsible for the influx of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ into mitochondria [10-13].MRS2(mitochondrial RNA splicing2）was initially identified for its requirement in mitochondrial group II intron splicing and growth onnon-fermentable media [1O]. This is a result of its intramitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ deficiency affecting the ribozyme [11] because Mrs2 plays an essential role in mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ influx [12]. The decrease in mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content of the mrs2△ mutant can be rescued by the expression of bacterial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transporter CorA fused to a mitochondrial N-terminal leader sequence of MRS2 [13].The functional complementation Was also observed with the orthologue of Mrs2 in humans [14].

Yeast Lpe1O also localizes at the mitochondrial inner membrane and shares $32 \%$ ofits sequence identity and a conserved GMN motif with Mrs2[15]. Similarly,Lpe10 disruptant exhibited defects in both growth on glycerol-based media and RNA processing, together with a reduction in the mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content. Overexpression of LPE10 leads to a sharp increase of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ in mitochondria,indicating its structural and functional similarities to Mrs2[15].A tight interaction between Lpe10 and Mrs2 and their hetero-oligomerization was discovered [16].However, these two proteins cannot fully substitute for one another,indicating that their functions are not redundant.In fact,deletion of LPE10 leads to a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential,which is not observed when MRS2 is deleted [16].

To investigate whether other partners might be involved in the regulation of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis in mitochondria,we arranged a genetic screening to look for the suppressors of the $m r s 2 \Delta$ mutant.Previously, we isolated a novel gene YMR166Cas a candidate involved in mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis [17]. However, we were uncertain about how exactly YMR166C is involved in this process.We now show that YMR166C is a mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.We renamed YMR166C to MME1 (mitochondrial magnesium exporter 1).Mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis turns out to be a finely controlled process directed by the combinatory work of the importers and the exporter.

# 2.Materialsand Methods

# 2.1.Strains,growth medium, and plasmids

Yeast transformation was carried out by the standard lithium acetate method [18]. Empty vectors were transformed in parallel to serve as negative controls. Single colonies of each transformed yeast strain were picked out and grown on synthetic selective media.Glucose $( 2 \% )$ Was added into YPD or SD medium,while $2 \%$ glycerol was added into YPG or SG medium. The $S { \mathrm { D - M g } } ^ { 2 + }$ media used in this study were prepared with a yeast nitrogen base without the addition of $\mathrm { M g } \mathrm { S } 0 _ { 4 }$ The $\mathrm { S D - M g ^ { 2 + } }$ media were carefully prepared with ultra-pure water, highpurity reagents $( \geq 9 9 . 9 9 \% )$ ,and a clean container to avoid any $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ contamination.

Expression plasmidsused in yeast were pRS315,pGPD-413,and pTEF-425 obtained from ATCC [19]. For heterologous expression in E.coli, the plasmid used was a home-made pEXS-DH,generated on the backbone of pET-22b $( + )$ .The region between the T7 transcription start and T7 terminator Was replaced by an N-terminal ${ 8 \times \mathrm { H I S } }$ tag sequence followed bya TEV cleavage site and a C-terminal ${ 8 \times \mathrm { H I S } }$ tag sequence.The linker sequence had been optimized for protein expression.

# 2.2.Measurement of metal content in isolated mitochondria

Isolation of yeast mitochondria was performed according to a previous protocol [2O]. Protein level of each mitochondrial sample was determined by the BCAProtein Assay Kit(Thermo Scientific Pierce,Waltham, MA, USA).The content of each metal ion was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry(ICP-MS）XII（Thermo Electron Corp.，Waltham，MA，USA）by the Analysis Center of Tsinghua University.

# 2.3.Measurement of mitochondria $M g ^ { 2 + }$ by spectrofluorometry

Mitochondria were isolated from cells of the wild-type and mme1△ mutant and then transferred into a nominally $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -free solution for loading of the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -sensitive fluorescent dye,mag-fura-2-AM(Molecular Probe).Loading was performed by incubating mitochondria（0.5 $\mathrm { m g / m l } )$ in SHbuffer ( $_ { 0 . 6 \mathrm { M } }$ sorbitol, $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES ± KOH; $\mathrm { p H } = 7 . 4$ ） with $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { M } }$ mag-fura-2-AM for $3 5 { \mathrm { ~ m i n } }$ at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ 、Mitochondria were subsequently washed three times with SHbuffer to remove excess fluorescent dye.A further incubation for $3 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ was carried out to allowa complete hydrolysis of the fluorescent dyes,and the mitochondria were washed twice before measuring the fluorescence intensity.To analyze $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -dependent changes in mitochondria, external $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ was elevated successively to a final concentration of 10 or $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ .Fluorescence intensitiesat $3 4 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ and $3 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ were recorded continuously[12].Concentrations of intra-mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ were calculated from the $3 4 0 / 3 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ratio according to the formula of Grynkiewicz et al.with a dissociation constant of the mag-fura- $\cdot 2 \pm \mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ complex of 1.52 in SH buffer and 1.89 in KCl buffer ( $1 5 0 \ \mathrm { m M }$ KCl, $3 0 0 \ \mathrm { m M }$ sucrose, $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES $\pm ~ \mathrm { K O H }$ . $\mathsf { p H } = 7 . 4$ [21].

# 2.4.Protein purification

Mme1 protein was expressed in E.coli CD41(DE3) cells cultured in 4 L LB media containing ampicillin. Isopropyl $\cdot \mathrm { \beta }$ -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, $0 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ )wasadded into the cellsat an ${ \tt O D } _ { 6 0 0 }$ of about 0.3 to induce protein expression at $1 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 6 { - } 2 0 \ \mathrm { h }$ .The culture was then harvested and resuspended $( 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { g / m l } )$ inbufferA( $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ NaCl, $2 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, $1 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l }$ DTT, $1 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l }$ RNAase; $\mathsf { p H } = 7 . 5$ ）andbrokenby French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i three times.Unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation at $2 4 { , } 0 0 0 \ g$ for $4 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ Then, the supernatant was again centrifuged with $2 5 0 { , } 0 0 0 g$ for $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ The pellet (membrane and membrane proteins)was resuspended and dissolved with buffer B( $2 0 \ \mathrm { \ m M }$ Tris, $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m M }$ NaCl, $2 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, $3 0 \mathrm { m M }$ imidazole; $\mathrm { p H } = 7 . 5$ ).FC12was added toa final concentration of $0 . 1 5 \%$ (w/v),and the unsolubilized pelletwascentrifuged at $2 0 0 { , } 0 0 0 g$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ The supernatant containing the Mme1 protein was then purified by nickel-affinity chromatography.Briefly, the supernatant was loaded onto a $1 \mathrm { m l }$ volume of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTAagarose column (Invitrogen) and washed with 30 column volumes of buffer B.The column-bound protein was eluted with5 column volumes of buffer C( $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, $1 5 0 \mathrm { m M N a C l }$ $2 \mathrm { m M }$ phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m M } }$ imidazole, $0 . 1 5 \%$ FC12; $\mathsf { p H } =$ 7.5).To further purify the proteinand dissolve the protein in buffer suitable for the following proteoliposome experiments,the eluted protein was passed through a Sephadex 2oo column with buffer D( $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES, $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m M } }$ KCl, $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ （20 $\mathrm { { M g C l } } _ { 2 }$ $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ ATP-Mg, $0 . 1 5 \%$ FC12; $\mathrm { p H } = 7 . 0$ [22].

# 2.5. $M g ^ { 2 + }$ transport assay of reconstituted proteoliposomes

Assays of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport activity of Mme1 in proteoliposomes were accomplished according to the published methods with some modifications[22,23].Chloroform-methanol (3:1) was added to dissolve the yeast total lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids,Inc. Alabama, USA),and the lipids were subsequently dried in a rotary evaporator at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for another $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to remove the methanol and traces of chloroform.The dried lipids were suspended at room temperature to a final concentration of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m l }$ in buffer E ( $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES, $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m M } }$ KCl, $1 5 \mathrm { \ m M \ M g C l _ { 2 } }$ $0 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ ATP-Mg; $\mathrm { p H } = 7 . 0$ ).The lipid suspension was then sonicated to generate a suspension of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs).The SUV suspension was then flash-frozen in liquid $\mathsf { N } _ { 2 }$ and subsequently slowly thawed at room temperature for three cycles. $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ Was loaded into the liposomes using the above steps.The liposomes were then destabilized bythe addition of $0 . 5 \% \mathrm { ( w / v ) }$ Triton X-1oO and incubated for $3  { \mathrm { h } }$ at room temperature with agitation.Afterwards,purified Mme1 was added with a lipid/protein ratio of 40:1 $\left( \mathrm { w / w } \right)$ ,and the mixture containing $0 . 5 \% \mathrm { ( w / v ) }$ Triton X-1oo was incubated for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ with agitation. The detergents were removed by incubating the mixture for $1 { - } 2 \mathrm { h }$ at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ with agitation with additional Bio-Beads SM-2(Bio-Rad）at a bead (wet weight)/detergent ratio of 60:1 $\mathrm { ( w / w ) }$ .Bio-BeadsSM-2were then removed from the solution,and a second aliquot of Bio-Beads SM-2 was added.The sample was incubated for $2 { \cdot } 3 \mathrm { h }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ with agitation. The proteoliposome solution was separated from the Bio-Beads SM-2 and then centrifuged at $2 1 0 { , } 0 0 0 g$ for $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The pellets of liposome were resuspended in buffer F( $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES, $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m M \ N a C l }$ $\mathsf { p H } = 6 . 0$ ).To ensure more complete $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport by Mme1,the suspension of liposomes was incubated at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ Finally, the liposomes were spun down and washed with corresponding reaction buffer F twice and the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ contents within the liposomes were determined by ICP-MS.The influx measurements were similar with the efflux assays except that the empty proteoliposomes,without loading $1 5 \mathrm { m M M g C l _ { 2 } }$ and $0 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ ATP-Mg,were incubated in the reaction buffer containing $1 5 \mathrm { \ m M \ M g C l _ { 2 } }$ ,with or without adding $0 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ ATP-Mg.

# 3.1.Identification of Mme1 as an antagonizer of mitochondrial $M g ^ { 2 + }$ importersMrs2 and Lpe10

The mrs2△ mutant loses the ability to respire [1O].To identify other genes involved in mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis,we previously initiated a genetic screening to search for genes whose mutations are able to suppress the growth defect of $m r s 2 \Delta$ on non-fermentable media (Fig.1A).YMR166C(hereaftercalled MME1)was isolated in this process. Deletion of MME1 is able to reverse the growth and group II RNA splicing defects in the mrs2△ mutant [17].

MME1 is a nuclear gene that encodes a protein product consisting of 368 amino acids.It is predicted to be a mitochondrial inner membrane transporter belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family[24,25].However,little is known about the molecular function of this protein.As a first step towards the molecular characterization of Mme1,we determined its intracellular localization by confocal microscopy.As shown in Fig.1B,the fluorescence pattern of the GFP-tagged Mme1 well overlapped that of the RFP-tagged Cox9 (subunit VIla of cytochrome c oxidase [Complex IV], the terminal member of the mitochondrial inner membrane electron transport chain).This result supports that

Fig.1.Mme1 antagonizes the functions of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ importers,Mrs2 and Lpe10.(A)A schematic summarizing the genetic screening processbased on mTn-lacZ/LEU2 transwe d wi onglycerolmedium,suggestingthattheMmel-GFPusedtodeterminethemitochondrialmembranelocalizationofMmelisfnctional.

Mme1 is localized in the mitochondrial membrane,consistent with the prediction based on its primary sequence.

Although MME1 was proposed as a candidate involved in mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ metabolism,it was not known whether mme1 suppresses the defects of mrs2△ mutant by directly and independently regulating mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis.To explore how Mme1 might participate in mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis,we tested whether mme1 could also be a suppressor of lpe10 synchronously.We reasoned that if MME1 deletion suppressed mrs2△by independentlyaffectingmitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis,it would also be able to suppress Mrs2's functional homologue Lpe10 as well. Spotting assay results showed that the deletion of the MME1 gene could also completely rescue the growth defectof the lpe10△and mrs2△ lpe10△ mutant strains on nonfermentable carbon sources,as that of mrs2△(Fig.1C and D).However, whenan endogenous level of Mme1 was provided additionally in the mme1△ mrs2△and mme1△ lpe10△doublemutants,the growth defect phenotype reappeared,proving that the growth of the double mutants was trulyrestored by the deletion of MME1(Fig.1E).Similarresults were also obtained when Mme1-GFP fusion protein was expressed in the mme1△ mrs2△ double mutant strain,suggesting that the Mme1- GFP fusion protein used for the above localization study is functional (Fig. 1F).

We speculated that mme1 might suppress mrs2 and lpe10 through directly affecting mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ levels.To test this hypothesis, the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content in the mitochondria of mme $1 \Delta$ was measured.As shown in Fig.2A,disruption of MME1 by itself led to a slight but significant increase of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ level. The lpe10△ mutant carried a lower amount of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ ,and loss of MME1 in the lpe10△ mutant resulted in a significant but not yet complete restoration of the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content, similar to what was observed in the $m r s 2 \Delta$ mutant strain in both this and previous studies.This result suggests that Mme1 may function directly in the regulation of steady-state concentrations of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ .The suppression effect of mme1 on mrs2 and lpe10 thus can be explained by the antagonizing effects of two factors,one enhancing and one reducing the mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ level.

Because mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ is critical for the splicing of group I intron RNA,which includes those of mitochondrial transcripts of COX1 and COB[26],we further tested whether the deletionof MME1 could rescue the RNA splicing defect in the lpe10△ mutant,as observed in the mrs2△ mutant.As shown in Fig.2B,almost all the COB transcripts of the wild-type yeast were in the mature form,while there were plenty of immature pre-mRNAs of COB in the $m r s 2 \Delta$ and lpe10△ yeast cells, consistent with previous reports from others [10,15].Deletion of MME1 can fully rescue the group I RNA splicing defect in the mrs2△ and lpe1o△disruptants,asattested bya dramatic increase ofmature mRNA as well as an almost complete disappearance of immature mRNA in these double mutants (Fig.2B).

Taken together, the deletion of MME1 can rescue various defects observedinthelpe1 $0 \Delta$ disruptantas in themrs2△mutant,likely through an independent and opposite effect on mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis.Since Mme1 is a mitochondrial carrier protein [24],we proposed that Mme1 might act as an $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.

# 3.2.Mme1 overexpression leads to mitochondrial $M g ^ { 2 + }$ reduction

If Mme1 mediates $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux from the mitochondria while Mrs2 and Lpe1O are responsible for $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ influx,the phenotype of overproducing Mme1 would be quite similar to that of mutants lacking Mrs2 or Lpe10.As predicted,yeast strain overexpressing Mme1 showed asevere growth defect on glycerol medium similar to that of the mrs2△ or lpe10△ mutants (Figs.1C and 2C).

Next,we sought to clarify whether the growth defect of the Mme1- overexpressing strain resulted from a decrease of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ as seen with mrs2△ or lpe10△ mutants.For that, the mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ contents in both yeast strains transformed with an empty vector and MME1 respectively were measured.Consistently,mitochondria of the strain overexpressing Mme1 contained a significantly lower $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ concentration than that of the control strain (Fig.2D).

We then sought to measure the time-course response of Mme1 to extra-mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ ,using an $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -sensitive fluorescent dye, mag-fura-2.Mitochondria were isolated from cells of wild-type and MME1-deleted yeast strains and transferred into a nominally $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ ， free solution to facilitate the loading of the membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl ester(AM) of mag-fura-2,activation of the probe,and determination of the basal intra-mitochondrial free $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ .When the extra-mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ concentration was increased stepwise to 10 and then to $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ ,the fluorescent intensity ratio of $3 4 0 / 3 8 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ (340and $3 8 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ are standard excitation wavelengths for the ionbound and the free mag-fura-2,respectively）also immediately increased,indicating that $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transiently and instantly crossed the mitochondrial membrane.The increased rate of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ loading in the wild-type yeast is much lower than that of the mme1△ mutant (Fig.2E).We explain this by the fact thatwhen Mme1 was functional, some $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux occurred,resulting in a reduced mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ accumulation.All these data suggest that Mme1 works opposite to Mrs2 and Lpe1O,and provide further evidence supporting the notion that Mme1 may be responsible for the efflux of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$

# .3.Heterologous expressionof yeastMme1in E.coli reduces its $M g ^ { 2 + }$ leve

Mitochondria are thought to originate from proteobacteria that were taken up by a type of nucleated cell and in some aspects mimic bacterial cells such as E.coli.To obtain more direct and convincing evidence, the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport activity of Mme1 was examined ina heterologous biosystem in which Mme1 was expressed in E.coli.

As a membrane protein,Mme1 is difficult to significantly express and purifyinvitro.Initially,little expression of Mme1 was detected in E. coli whena number of vectors (pET-21b,pET-28a,pGEX4T-1,pQE$8 0 \mathrm { L } ,$ and pTWIN-1) were used.Nonetheless,expression of Mme1 was finally achieved by using the pEXS-DH plasmid vector with an Nterminal HIS-tag and E. coli host strain CD41(DE3） ( $F ^ { - }$ ompT gal dcm lon $h s d S _ { B } ( r _ { B } { ^ - } ~ m _ { B } { ^ - } )$ $\lambda$ (DE3[lacl lacUV5-T7 gene 1 ind1 sam7 nin5]) (Fig. 3A).

Results of confocal microscopy showed that the heterogeneously expressed Mme1 protein in E.coli localizes in the peripheral area(plasma membrane) of E.coli,coinciding with the presumed localization of Mme1 in the mitochondrial membrane in yeast (Fig.3B).

We next asked whether Mme1 expression in such a foreign system could facilitate cellular $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux. Interestingly,Mme1 expression mildly but noticeably conferred E.coli resistance to $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ stress,but not to $Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ or ${ \mathsf { N a } } ^ { + }$ (Fig.3C).The growth differences were further confirmed by culturing the vector control and Mme1-expressing E.coli strains in corresponding liquid media.When cultured in LB medium supplemented with only IPTG or together with $2 { \mathrm { ~ m M ~ } } Z { \mathrm { n } } ^ { 2 + }$ and $2 0 0 \mathrm { m M N a ^ { + } }$ ,there were no significant differences between the vector control and the Mme1-expressing E.coli strain.However, the Mme1- expressing E.coli strain showed significant growth advantages over the vector control in LB medium with $2 0 0 \mathrm { \ m M \ M g ^ { 2 + } }$ ,indicating that Mme1 expression specifically confers $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ resistance (Fig.3D).

Further analysis of cellular $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ contents indicated that expression of Mme1 indeed significantly reduced the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ level of the cells (Fig.3E).The reduction of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ contents here is not as dramatic as in Fig.2D,likely because of the foreign or non-native nature of Mme1 when expressed in E.coli.Nonetheless,a decreased $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ concentration enables the Mme1-expressing E.coli to be resistant to $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ excess. These results suggest that Mme1 is necessary and sufficient in mediating mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux.

# 3.4.The purified Mme1 can mediate $M g ^ { 2 + }$ export in vitro when reconstituted into liposomes

The above data together strongly suggest that Mme1 is an $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.Despite this,direct evidence of Mme1 as an $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter is still lacking. One definite evidence would be a transport measurement experiment using purified Mme1 protein performed ina clean in vitro system-proteoliposomes.

To obtain purified Mme1,we screened fordetergents that mightbe able to dissolve it.Mme1 was solubilized most efficiently in $2 \%$ Foscholine-12 (FC12),better than DDM,while other detergents,including $2 \%$ CHAPS,were not very effective on Mme1 (Table1).Mme1 is purified by Ni-NTAagarose columnand Sephadex 2oO column sequentially from total proteins (Fig.3A) (more details in Materialsand methods section).

Purified Mme1 was then reconstituted into yeast total-lipid-based liposomes as described in the Materials and methods section.TMHMM analysis suggests that Mme1 possesses two transmembrane domains within the 115-168 amino acid residues region.To analyze the orientation of the reconstituted Mme1 in the proteoliposomes,they were treated separately with two proteases-trypsin and chymotrypsin.Pure recombinant Mme1 was also subjected to the same treatments to work as controls. Protease digestion of the pure Mme1 and proteoliposome-incorporated Mme1 led to an almost complete disappearance of the protein band in SDS-PAGE (Fig.4A).This result indicates that Mme1 was preferentially inserted into proteoliposomes with most of it exposed to the exterior of the liposomes in our reconstituted samples.Were the orientation opposite,little or only part of the amino acids between the two predicted transmembrane domains of Mme1 would have been digested.Worth noting is that this predicted orientation of Mme1 in the membrane is opposite to that of AtMrs2-10,which was preferentially inserted into proteoliposomes with most of it exposed to the interior of the liposomes [22].This difference is consistent with their opposite functions in $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport with AtMrs2-10 as $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ importer whereas Mme1 as a candidate of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.

According to this topology model,we predicted that after protease digestion,a6 KD polypeptide of Mme1 imbedded within the liposomes would be protected and undigested.However,we failed to detect this predicted 6 KD polypeptide band in our SDS-PAGE gel. One possible explanation for the failure might be the small size and high hydrophobicity of this protein portion.Therefore,at this moment,the proposed model remains onlya favorite possibility (Fig.4B).

The $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ export activity of Mme1 was subsequently measured.To ensure more complete $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport, the Mme1 proteoliposomes packed with $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ buffer were incubated with $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -free reaction bufferat $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .After the reaction,the contents of the remaining $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ within the proteoliposomes was determined by ICP-MS. The more $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ remaining in the proteoliposomes,the less $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ was transported out.As shown in Fig.4C,a significant decrease in the internal $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content was observed when liposomes were incorporated with Mme1,indicating that the reconstituted Mme1 was able to mediate $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux out of liposomes in the presence of an outwarddirected $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ gradient. Liposome integrity was intact as the $\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ packed within the liposomes did not change appreciably(Fig.4D).Interestingly, we observed that the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ export reaction occurred only in the presence of ATP-Mg packed in the proteoliposomes.In the absence of ATP, theexportingactivityalmost disappeared (Fig.4E).Therefore,it seems that ATP is indispensable for the transport of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ by Mme1.

We further explored the role of ATP in this process-primarily concerning whether the hydrolysis of ATP is necessary for the transport of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ .To address this question, $\mathsf { A T P } \mathsf { \gamma S }$ ,a common ATP analog,which cannot be hydrolyzed,was used to replace ATP to test whether $\mathsf { A T P } \mathsf { \gamma S }$ can also mediate the transport.In the presence of $\mathsf { A T P } \mathsf { \gamma } \mathsf { { y } } ^ { \mathsf { { S } } }$ or in the absence of ATP hydrolysis,an obvious reduction,albeit less dramatic than ATP，of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ within proteoliposomes was also observed (Fig.4F).This result suggests that ATP-Mg may act asa substrate for the transportation independent of ATP hydrolysis.As some structural differences between ATP and $\mathsf { A T P } \mathsf { \gamma } \mathsf { S }$ exist,Mme1 may prefer the native ATP to non-native $\mathsf { A T P } \mathsf { \gamma } \mathsf { S }$ in facilitating $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport.

We also measured the importing activity of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ by Mme1 in vitro. The importation assay was similar to the exportation assay except that the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ and ATP were added to the reaction buffer instead of within the liposomes.When Mme1 was reconstituted into the liposomes,the Mme1 could also transport some $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ into the liposomes in an ATPdependent manner (Fig.4G).However, the influx activity is much less robust than the efflux activity.These results suggest that Mme1 has a preference for exporting over importing $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$

There are some other mitochondrial carrier proteins utilizing ATPMg as the exchanger for Pi.However,the functions of these carrier proteins are to transport adenine nucleotides across the mitochondrial inner membrane,and thus regulate the homeostasis of ATP but not $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ within mitochondria as other ATP/ADP carriers.In yeast, Sal1 is the only ATP-Mg/Pi carrier discovered so far which transports ATP-Mg into the mitochondrial matrix and Pi out of the mitochondrial matrix [27-29]. Therefore,we wondered whether or not Sal1 functions by transporting $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ into mitochondria,thereby working opposite to Mme1.While overexpressing Sal1 in the Mme1-overexpressing yeast strain,we found that Sal1 did not suppress the phenotype of Mme1 overexpression,indicating that Sal1 and Mme1 may not have functional interaction (Fig.4H).The reason why overexpression of Sal1,an ATP-Mg importer,cannot rescue the phenotype of overexpression of Mme1 may be that the accessory $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ entering with ATP are physiologically too minor to appreciably alter the mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ level.

The proteoliposome experiment provided direct evidence in supporting the hypothesis that yeast Mme1 mediates $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport, mainly the efflux of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ .In addition,accessory proteins are not required for Mme1's function,or in other words,Mme1 is necessary and sufficient for $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ export.

# 3.5.Mitochondria can supplement $M g ^ { 2 + }$ to cytoplasm for growth in $M g ^ { 2 + }$ -depletedcondition

Following the molecular characterization of Mme1 both in vivo and in vitro as described above,we then analyzed the physiological function of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux from mitochondria mediated by Mme1.Our primary investigation concerned whether Mme1 contributes to the cytoplasmic $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ levels when external $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ is lacking.To address this concern, the growth rates of the wild-type and the mme $1 \Delta$ mutant yeast strains were monitored.As shown in Fig.5A, these two yeast strains exhibited identical growth rates under normal growth conditions.However,the mme1△ mutant grew much worse than the wild-type control when they were transferred from normal medium to $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -deficient medium (Fig.5B).This can be explained by the failure of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ release from the mme1△ mitochondria when the cytosol is in dire need of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ .These data support that mitochondria are helpful $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ pools when the cell is stressed by an acute $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ shortage. In $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -deficient growth conditions,the Mme1-mediated release of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ from mitochondria into the cytosol might be important for the cell although this might compromise the mitochondria's own functions.

# 4. Discussion

Mme1 has been identified as the first yeast mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 } ^ { + } \ e x ^ { . } }$ porter bya genome-wide screening.Besides suppressing the growth defect in $m r s 2 \Delta$ and lpe10△ mutants,deletion of MME1 canalso rescue group II RNA splicing defects and restore the decreased mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content in these two mutant strains.Further studies revealed that Mme1 can regulate the mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ efflux in yeast, mediate the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport out of the cells when heterologously expressed in E.coli,and display $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ output activities when purified Mme1 is inserted into liposomes in vitro,providing definite evidence that Mme1 is a yeast mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.

# 4.1.Mme1 as a mitochondrial $M g ^ { 2 + }$ exporter

There are only two $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport proteins that have been previously purified and reconstituted into liposomes-T.maritima CorA and Arabidopsis AtMrs2-10 [22,30]. In this work,through the use of proteoliposome,we provide compelling evidence showing Mme1 as a mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.

In the proteoliposome experiments,we found that the transport of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ by Mme1 is dependent on ATP,although the hydrolysis of ATP isnotrequired.We suspected that ATP may be transported together with $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ .To address this possibility,we measured the efflux of ATP from ATP-Mg loaded liposomes reconstituted with Mme1.However, there is no obvious efflux of ATP out of the liposomes.Because the amount of ATP loaded into the liposomes is only 1/3Oth of that of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ ,if the ATP is transported together with $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ at a ratio of 1:1, we predict that only a maximum of 1/3oth of the initial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ could be transported out.However,as shown in our results (Fig.4C and E), $\sim 5 0 \%$ of the total $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ was transported out from the liposomes.Therefore,we suspect that the transport is mediated by an ATP/ATP-Mg exchange.This speculated transportation mechanism requires further experimental studies to prove.

Our in vitro studies suggest that Mme1 preferentially exports $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ though it also carries much less robust $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ importing activity. However, the in vivo results indicate that Mme1 only functions as an $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter.One possible explanation for this is that in the context of in vivo conditions,the net result of these transporting activities might only present as $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ export.Therefore,it may also be the same with Mrs2.However,only the importing activity of the AtMrs2 has been measured while the exporting activity of it has not yet been measured successfully so far [22].Another possible explanation is that in vivo there might be other accessory proteins interacting with Mme1,acting as molecular switches to control the orientation of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transportation. Some other ion transporters indeed have been shown to function in this manner.For example,the central $\ \alpha ( 1 )$ pore-forming subunit $( \mathsf { C a } ( \mathsf { V } ) \alpha ( 1 ) )$ interacts with different accessory subunits to control the current of calcium [31]. In the case of Mrs2,Mrs2 proteins form heteromultimers with Lpe10 and work together with Lpe10 to mediate the import of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ into mitochondria [16]. It is possible that the interactions between Mrs2 and Lpe1O might control the orientation of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ transport.Alternatively, there may also be other accessory proteins to help control this process.

# 4.2.Regulatory effects of Mme1 on $M g ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis in mitochondria and cytosol

Decrease of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ in the mrs2△,lpe10△ mutants or MME1-overexpressing strains causes growth defect on glycerol media, asaresult of severe disruption of respiration because several critical enzymatic reactions in the electron transport chain require $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + } \left[ 1 0 , 1 1 \right]$ Additional functions modulated by $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ within mitochondria are anion channels, $\mathrm { H ^ { + } }$ gradients,and membrane potentials across the mitochondrial membrane[1].In otherwords,mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ is involved in many processes and it is critical to maintain its proper concentration ina tight range because evena tinyalteration mayaffect the functions of mitochondria and even the fate of the whole cell.

As the first mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ exporter identified,the role of Mme1 on the overall control of mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ must be considered in the context of the whole cell. On the one hand,perturbation of MME1 expression corresponds to mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ changes;on the other hand,isolated normal mitochondria with intact MME1 or intact mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis systems are still sensitive to the external $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ variation,shown by the fact that the internal $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ concentrations fluctuate with the added $\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } }$ levels.Therefore,mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis is likely subjected to multiple levels of control even in a unicellular eukaryotic organism.The plasma membrane-resident importers may control the amount of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ imported,while organelles such as the vacuole provide additional buffers for cytosolic $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ maintenance. On top of these controls,which already provide a relatively constant $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ environment for the mitochondria, the importers and exporters in the mitochondria themselves then work together intricately to fine-tune the mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ level.Expression perturbation of either of these partners by overexpression or removal may shift the $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ balance. In our opinion, the exporting role of Mme1 likely acts as a second checkpoint to maintain an accurate balance of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + \bullet }$ concentration within mitochondria under normal growth conditions.

On the other hand,under $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -deficient states,mitochondria can additionally supply some precious $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ to the cytosol. Previous studies in mammalian cells have already uncovered a necessity of the maintenance of proper $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ levels for the cell cycle,cell proliferation,and cell differentiation,all ofwhich would be greatly inhibited when cellular available $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ is limited or reduced [1].As shown by our results in yeast,the mme1△ mutants can hardly grow in $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ -depleted fermentable medium,suggesting the significance of the contribution from the mitochondrion when external $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ is limited.In the context of a tightly controlled mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ homeostasis,we suspect that the contribution of mitochondria to cytosolic $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ may not be too dramatic.As shown in Figs.1C and 2A,with only a decrease of $\sim 3 0 \%$ in mitochondrial $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content,the mrs2△ and lpe10△mutants are unable to grow on glycerol medium.It can be inferred that the mitochondria must maintain a narrow range of $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ concentrations themselves, and therefore cannot usually release too much $\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ into the cytosol without sacrificing their own functions.
