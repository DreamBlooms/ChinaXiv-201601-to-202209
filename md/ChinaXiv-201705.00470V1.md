ABSTRACT: In this study， highly cross-linked and completely imidized polyimide aerogels were prepared from polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups，which was obtained as the condensation product of polyimide containing acid chloride side groups and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. After adding water and acid catalyst, the trimethoxysilane side groups hydrolyzed and condensed one another, and a continuous increase in the complex viscosities of the polyimide solutions with time was observed. The formed polyimide gels were dried by freeze-drying from tert-butyl alcohol to obtain polyimideaerogels,whichconsistedofathree-dimensional networkofpolyimidefbersangledtogether.Byvaryingthesolution concentrationofthepolimidecontainngtrimethoxsilanesidegroups,polyimideaerogels with diferentdensities (rangingfrom 0.19 to $0 . 4 2 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ were obtained. The resulting polyimide aerogels had small pore diameter (ranging from 20.7 to $5 8 . 3 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ) high surface area (ranging from 310 to $3 4 4 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \bar { \mathrm { g } } ,$ ，high $5 \%$ weight loss temperature in air (at about $4 4 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \$ ， and an excellent mechanical property. In addition, the glass transition temperature $( 3 4 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ of the polyimide aerogels was much higher than that $( 2 1 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ of the corresponding linear polyimide. So, even after being heated at $3 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ , the porous structure of the polyimide aerogels was not completely destroyed.

# INTRODUCTION

Aerogels are lightweight，open-celled，mesoporous materials prepared by replacing the fluids contained in gelsbyair without collapsing the pore structure.1,2 Because of their many unique characteristics,such as low density,high porosity,low dielectric constant, low thermal conductivity,high surface area,and high acoustic impedance,aerogels have drawn great interest in a wide range of applications,including heat insulator, dust capturer for space applications,support for catalysts,low dielectric constant material for semiconductor devices,adsorbent, drug carrier,and sound attenuator.3-7

Among various aerogels, silica aerogel is the most well-known and extensively studied.However, the poor mechanical property greatly hinders its widespread application.For example，the collapse strengths under compression of pure silica aerogel with mass densities of O.112 and $0 . 2 4 0 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ are only 0.018 and $1 . 0 1 \ \mathrm { M P a } , \$ respectively.89 The fragility of silica aerogel is traced to the weak interconnection in its“pearl-necklace-like”network structure，which is formed between secondary spherical silica particles held together.10,11To improve the mechanical property of silica aerogel，various strategies have been investigated, most notably via cross-linking of its skeletal framework with polymers.7,12-17

In addition to pure silica aerogel and reinforced silica aerogels，polymeric aerogels like syndiotactic polystyrene,18 polyurethane,19 polyurea,20 cellulose,poly(vinyl alcohol),21 polyamide,22plbezoxae,2lde and chitin27 have also been prepared. Compared with pure silica aerogel, polyericeroglsosesseerehicalpoet

Polyimide is an important high-performance material with good thermal stability，excellent mechanical property，and low dielectric constant,as well as outstanding chemical and radiation resistance. Some pioneering work on polyimide aerogel has been reported.Previously, linear polyimide aerogels were prepared by chemical imidization of poly(amic acid)s synthesized from dianhydrides_and diamines in solvents, followed by supercritical drying.29 During chemical imidization, the newly formed rigid polyimide chain segments caused the polymers to form gels because the rigid polyimides were insoluble and separated from the solvents.However， the completion of chemical imidization at room temperature was hindered by the increased immobility of polyimide'srigid structure. So polyimide aerogels prepared by the method required a thermal treatment to convert the residual amic acid group to the imide group.Furthermore,the thermal treatment was also needed to rearrange the instable isoimide group formed during chemical imidization to the imide group.The thermal treatment was performed either before or after supercritical drying of the polyimide gels.If the thermal treatment was carried out before the supercritical drying, the polyimide gels should be put in a pressurized autoclave in order to reduce the solvent evaporating from the gels.If the thermal treatment was carried out after the supercritical drying, the heating rate should be slow enough to prevent shrinkage of the polyimide aerogels resulting from melting.

In 201o,Leventis and co-workers introduced an alternative route where linear polyimide aerogels were prepared by supercritical drying of polyimide gels synthesized from a dianhydride and a diisocyanate，eliminating the chemical imidization process30But polyimide aerogel made by this way exhibited much weaker mechanical strength than chemically identical polyimide aerogel prepared from a dianhydride and a diamine. Then,Leventis et al. prepared cross-linked polyimide aerogels synthesized from dianhydrides and trisocyanates.31 This kind of polyimide aerogel was very sturdy,indicating the strength of polymeric aerogels could be improved by introducing a cross-linked structure.

In 2011,Leventis and co-workers reported another kind of cross-linked polyimide aerogel, which was prepared by supercritical drying of polyimide gels synthesized from a norbornene end-capped diimide.3² This kind of polyimide aerogel combined facile one-step synthesis with high mechanical strength and specific energy absorption.However，they had unsaturated backbone,which limited their use in air at high temperature.

Inrecent years,Meadorandco-workershave fabricated crosslinked polyimide aerogels by reacting poly(amic acid) oligomers containing terminal anhydride groups with cross-linkers [either1,3,S-triaminophenoxybenzene or octa(aminophenyl)- silsesquioxane] to produce cross-linked poly(amic acid) structures,followed by chemical imidization at room temperatureandspeitcald6d polyimide aerogel fabricated by Meador and co-workers was recognized as one of the 1OO most technologically significant products to enter the marketplace by the prestigious science journal R&D.33 However，poly(amic acid） could not be completely imidized by chemical imidization reagents at room temperature，and instable isoimide group could be formed during chemical imidization.29.30 Furthermore,thecross-linked poly(amic acid） gels made from the reaction of cross-linkers with short poly(amic acid) oligomers formed too quickly for incorporation of chemical imidization reagents.25

In this study, trimethoxysilanes were incorporated into every repeating unit of a polyimide as side groups,and the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of the trimethoxysilane contributed to the formation of highly cross-linked polyimide gels.Before gelation, the polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups was imidized completely via thermal imidization, eliminating the need for chemical imidization reagents and the problem of incomplete imidization.The polyimide gels were then dried by freeze-drying from tert-butyl alcohol to obtain polyimide aerogels,avoiding expensive and time-consuming supercritical drying.In addition,high mechanical strength and good thermal stability of the polyimide aerogels were achieved due to the highly cross-linked structure.

# EXPERIMENTALSECTION

The stain amplitude was set at $1 \%$ ,and the sweep frequency was set at $1 \ \mathrm { H z }$ (well inside the linear viscoelastic range).Bulk density was calculated fromweightand physical dimensionof samples.The skeletal density was measured using a Micromeritics Accupyc 1340 helium pycnometer.The morphology was observed with a Hitachi TM-1000 scanning electron microscope (SEM).Before the SEMobservation, the samples were sputter-coated with gold.Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis(DMTA）was conducted with a Metler Toledo DMA in tensile mode at a heating rate of $5 ~ { ^ \circ } \mathrm { C } / \mathrm { m i n }$ and a frequency of $1 \ \mathrm { H z }$ Thermogravimetric analysis(TGA）was performed under air atmosphere (flow rate of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L / m i n } _ { \cdot }$ ）ataheating rateof $1 0 ~ { ^ \circ } \mathrm { C } / \operatorname* { m i n }$ from 50 to $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with a Mettler Toledo-TGA/DSCI instrument.The mechanical property was measured by an Instron model SS67 tensile tester at room temperature.The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement was carried out onaMicromeriticsASAP $2 0 2 0 \mathbf { M }$ system at the temperature of liquid nitrogen.Before measurement,all the samples were outgassed at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 1 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ The surface area was determined from the adsorption curve by the Brunauer-EmmetTeller method, and the pore size distribution was determined from the desorption curve by the Barret-Joyner-Halenda method.

Synthesis of Polyimide Containing Carboxylic Acid Side Groups. To a $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer were added BPADA （24 $\left( 1 0 . 4 0 9 8 \mathrm { \ g } , 2 0 . 0 \mathrm { \ m m o l } \right)$ ，DBA $\left( 2 . 9 0 5 5 \ \mathrm { g } , \ 1 9 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ ，and $m$ -cresol $\mathrm { \zeta } 5 0 \ \mathrm { m L } ,$ ).The mixture was stirred at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 8 h }$ under nitrogen atmosphere to yield a viscous solution.After cooling to room temperature，the viscous solution was diluted with $m$ -cresol and trickled into excess ethanol with stirring to afford a precipitate of polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups.The precipitate was collected，washed thoroughly with hot ethanol，and dried under vacuum at $1 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ The polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups had an inherent viscosity of $0 . 3 6 ~ \mathrm { d L } / \mathrm { g }$ when measured in DMF at a concentration of $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { g / d L }$ at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Synthesis of Polyimide Containing Trimethoxysilane Side Groups. To a $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ round-bottomed flaskwere added the polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups $( 0 . 6 3 6 6 \ g )$ ， $S \mathrm { O C l } _ { 2 }$ 0 $\langle 5 \mathrm { m L } \rangle$ ，and two drops of DMF.The mixture was stirred at reflux temperature for $0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，After removal of $S \mathrm { O C l } _ { 2 } ,$ 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane $\left( 0 . 1 7 9 3 \ \mathrm { g } , \ 1 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ ，triethylamine ( $\mathrm { \dot { 0 . 1 0 1 2 } ~ g , ~ 1 . 0 ~ m m o l } ,$ ，andDMF $( 8 ~ \mathrm { \ m L } )$ ）were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for $^ \mathrm { ~ 2 ~ h ~ }$ and then filtered to remove precipitated triethylamine hydrochloride.The resultingDMF solutionof polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups could be used in the next step directly without separation.

Preparation of Polyimide Aerogels.The preparation of sample 1 is used below as an example.To the obtained DMF solution of polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups wasadded a solution of water $( 0 . 0 9 0 0 \mathrm { g } , 5 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l } ) ,$ andHCl( $\left( 0 . 0 0 7 3 \mathrm { g } , 0 . 2 0 \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ in DMF $\left( 1 2 { \mathrm { m L } } \right)$ .The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 3 min and then drawn into syringes.A gel was formed and aged in the syringes for 2 days at room temperature.After the aging treatment,the resulting gel was removed from the syringes. The solvent within the gel was exchanged with tert-butyl alcohol (four times at room temperature, $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ each time, using about $1 0 \times$ the volume of the gel for each time).Finally, the gel containing tert-butyl alcohol was frozen and subjected to freezedrying at $- 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under vacuum.For polyimide aerogels with different densities,they were obtained by varying the concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups in DMF.

# RESULTSAND DISCUSSION

In this study，polyimide gels with cross-linked $_ { \mathrm { S i - O - S i } }$ network structure were prepared through the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of trimethoxysilane side groups on the polyimide backbone.The polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups was synthesized according to a three-step procedure as shown in Scheme 1.First,polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups was conveniently prepared by the polycondensation reaction of BPADA and DBA. Then， the carboxylic acid groups were converted into acid chloride groups, which were susceptible to react with the amino group of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane.

The complete imidization of the polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups was confirmed by $\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ NMR and FT-IR spectra. Figure S1 of the Supporting Information shows the $\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ NMR spectra of the polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups and its intermediate poly(amic acid) containing carboxylic acid side groups, for which all the signals were assigned to the hydrogen atoms of the repeating units,as expected.After imidization， the $^ 1 \mathrm { H }$ NMR signal at $8 . 2 2 \ \mathrm { p p m }$ corresponding to the amide group disappeared.Figure S2 of the Supporting Information shows the FT-IR spectra of the polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups and its intermediate poly(amic acid) containing carboxylic acid side groups. The poly(amic acid） containing carboxylic acid side groups exhibited the characteristic amide group absorptions at l655 $\mathsf { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ （ $\scriptstyle \mathrm { C = O }$ stretching）and $1 5 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { \bar { c m } } ^ { - \bar { 1 } } }$ (C-NH stretching). After imidization，the characteristic absorption bands of the amide group disappeared and the polyimide containing carboxylic acid side groups exhibited the imide group absorptions at $1 7 7 9 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (asym $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { C } } = { \mathrm { O } }$ stretching）and $\mathbf { \bar { 1 7 2 7 } ~ c m ^ { - 1 } }$ (sym $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { C } } = { \mathrm { O } }$ stretching, including the $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { C } } = { \mathrm { O } }$ stretching of the carboxylic acid side groups).

The $^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR spectrum of the polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups is shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information,in which all the signals were assigned as expected.After incorporating 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, the $\mathrm { ^ { 1 } \bar { H } }$ NMR signal at 13.41 ppm corresponding to the proton of carboxylic acid side group on polyimide disappeared and the signal corresponding to amide linkage appeared at $8 . 5 9 \mathrm { p p m }$ .On the basis of the results of ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H } ~ \mathrm { N M R } ,$ the polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups was successfully synthesized in this study.

Scheme 2 presents the synthesis route for polyimide gel with the aid of trimethoxysilane side groups on polyimide.Methoxy groups on the silicon atom were hydrolyzed to hydroxyls that subsequently condensed with each other or with the methoxy groups on silicon atom to give rise to $_ { \mathrm { S i - O - S i } }$ bonds.34,35 Since alkoxysilane hydrolysis is very slow under neutral conditions, hydrochloric acid was usedas a catalyst.3435

Gelation is a gradual transition from a viscoelastic liquid to a viscoelastic solid,and the measurement of the rheological property is particularly suitable to observe the gelation process and determine the gelation time.36 Three polyimide aerogels with different densities were obtained by varying the concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups in DMF (Table 1).Figure la shows a continuous increase in the complex viscosities of the polyimide solutions with time at room temperature after adding water and acid catalyst,which indicated thata cross-linked $S \mathrm { i - O - } S \mathrm { i }$ network structure formed and developed in the polyimide solutions as the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of trimethoxysilane side groups progressed.Figure 1b shows the evolution of the storage modulus $G ^ { \prime }$ ,which corresponds to the energy stored during deformation, and loss modulus $G ^ { \prime \prime }$ ,which corresponds to the energy dissipated duringdeformationwith reaction time,for the three samples.In general, the crossover of $G ^ { \prime }$ and $G ^ { \prime \prime }$ as a function of time occurs near the gelation point and is taken as a suffcient approximation forthelater7odngtoelteelotof samples1,2,and 3 were at about 4,21,and $3 8 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ,respectively. With increasing the concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups in DMF,the complex viscosity at the same reaction time increased and the gelation time decreased obviously.This was because the high content of trimethoxysilane side group contributed to faster formation of the cross-linked structure and higher cross-link density.

In order to strengthen the cross-link network, the polyimide gelswere aged for2 daysbefore being removed from the mold.

@Shrinkage was calculated via $1 0 0 \times$ (mold diameter-sample diameter/(molddiameter).Porositywascalculatedvia $1 0 0 \times \big ( 1 - \rho _ { \mathrm { b u l k } } / \rho _ { \mathrm { s k e l e t a l } } \big ) ,$ （ where $\rho _ { \mathrm { b u l k } }$ was the bulk density and $\rho _ { \mathrm { s k e l e t a l } }$ was the skeletal density. The $\rho _ { \mathrm { s k e l e t a l } }$ of the polyimide aerogels was $1 . 3 4 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } ;$ as determined by means of a helium pycnometer. $^ c V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was the total pore volume per gram of sample. For the first number, $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was calculated from the highest volume of nitrogen adsorbed along theadsorption isotherm; for the number in brackets, $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was calculated from the relationship $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } } \doteq \left( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { b u l k } } \right) -$ （204号 $( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { s k e l e t a l } } )$ .dThe average pore diameter was determined by the $4 V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } } / \sigma$ method, where $\sigma$ was the surface area determined by the BrunauerEmmet-Teller method. For the first number, $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was calculated from the highest volume of nitrogen adsorbed along theadsorption isotherm; for the number in brackets, $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was calculated from the relationship $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } } = \tilde { \left( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { b u l k } } \right) } - \left( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { s k e l e t a l } } \right)$ .eThe density ofsample 3 used for nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement was $0 . 3 9 6 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$

Figure 2 shows a gel of sample 1 as an example.During the aging, the cross-link reaction proceeded in the polyimide gel. As a result, the polyimide gel shrank and a portion of the solvent(DMF）was expelled from the polyimide gel.The resulting polyimide gels were elastic and strong.After solvent exchange with tert-butyl alcohol, they became hard and gray and lost transparency.

（204号 $^ { 2 9 } \mathrm { S i }$ Solid-state NMR was used to determine the condensation degree of the methoxy groups on silicon atom. The $^ { 2 9 } \mathrm { S i }$ solidstate NMR spectrum of sample 2 is shown in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information (Since the three polyimide aerogels with different densities had the same chemical structure, only the $^ { 2 9 } \mathrm { S i }$ solid-state NMR spectrum of sample 2 was measured).According to Loy et al.and Sugahara and co-workers, the signals between $- 4 0$ and $- 7 5 \ \mathrm { p p m }$ were assigned to three types of silicon.38,39 In order to clarify the condensation degree of the methoxy groups on silicon atom, curve fittng and peak integration were carried out using the Fityk software. The molar ratio of $[ - S i ( \mathrm { O C H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ( \mathrm { O S i } ) ,$ ， $- S i ( \mathrm { O H } ) _ { 2 } ( \mathrm { O S i } )$ ，and $- S i ( \mathrm { O H } ) ( \mathrm { O C H } _ { 3 } )$ (OSi)]: $[ - S i ( \mathrm { O C H } _ { 3 } ) ( \mathrm { O S i } ) _ { 2 }$ and $- S i ( \mathrm { O H } ) ( \mathrm { O S i } ) _ { 2 } ] { : [ - S i ( \mathrm { O S i } ) _ { 3 } ] }$ was $0 . 2 5 1 { : } 0 . 5 4 4 { : } 0 . 2 0 5 ,$ indicating that $6 5 . 1 \%$ of the methoxy groups on silicon atom formed a cross-linked siloxane network.

The polyimide containing trimethoxysiloxane side groups was soluble in DMF.However, if the aged polyimide wet gel waskeptinDMF for1 dayat $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (the volume of DMF was $2 0 \times$ the volume of the wet gel), $9 5 { - } 9 8 $ wt $\%$ polyimide was still insoluble.According to Feulner et al., the degree of crosslinking could be calculated as the ratio of the mass of insoluble portion to the total massof insoluble and soluble portions.40

So the kind of polyimide aerogel had a high degree of crosslinking (ranging from 95 to $9 8 \%$ ）

The gel is a three-dimensional porous structure filled with fluid.With the evaporation of fluid within a pore，capillary pressure begins to form. Since the capillary pressure is inversely related to the pore size,the capillary pressure is very high for aerogel with nanometer-sized pores.’As a result, the ambient pressure drying method generally causes drastic shrinkage or cracking of the aerogel. To prevent the damage to the aerogel structure，the drying process has to be done under special conditions.

Supercritical drying is the most commonly used method for gel drying. During supercritical drying， the phase boundary between the liquid phase and the vapor phase disappears and the fluid in pores can be removed without introducing the capillary pressure.41 However, the supercritical dryingis expensiveandtimeconsuming42Anothermethodthatcould avoid the formation of capillary pressure in pores is freezedrying,where the solvent in the gel is frozen and then removed by sublimation.Before freeze-drying,the fluid in the gel should be exchanged with a solvent the density of which does not exhibit considerable change upon freezing. Otherwise， the expansion or shrinkage of solvent upon freezing could result in damage to the gel structure.tert-Butyl alcohol isa solvent for which the density change upon freezing is small43 Furthermore, it has a high sublimation pressure；thus,the time required for freeze-drying could be shortened.43 So，in this study，the polyimide aerogels were freeze-dried from tert-butyl alcohol.

All of the polyimide aerogels shrank relative to the mold during fabrication.The shrinkages of the polyimide aerogels during fabrication ranged from 43 to $4 6 \%$ ，measured as the difference between the diameter of the syringe and that of dried samples.In comparison with some previous reports about polyimide aerogels,the polyimide aerogels showed relatively highshrinkageInadditionheshkagehe polyimide aerogel increased with increasing the concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysiloxane side groups in DMF. Shrinkage was reflected upon the bulk densities of the final polyimide aerogels.As a result， the density of the polyimide aerogels increased from $0 . 1 9 \pm 0 . 0 1$ to $0 . 4 2 \pm 0 . 0 2 \ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ with increasing the concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysilxane side groups in DMF from 0.04 to $0 . 0 6 \mathrm { g / m L }$ .As shown in Table 1，the shrinkage took place during aging， solvent exchange，and freeze-drying. Among these，the majority of shrinkage was observed during aging, resulting from the highly cross-linked network structure in the polyimide gels.It is interesting to note that the shrinkage during aging increased with increasing the concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysilxane side groups in DMF,while the shrinkage during solvent exchange showed an inverse trend. This could be explained by the fact that the strength of polyimide gel prepared from a high concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysilxane side groups was higher than that of polyimide gel prepared from a lower concentration of polyimide containing trimethoxysilxane side groups.

Figure 3 shows the morphological characteristics of the polyimide aerogels as a function of density using SEM.Unlike silica aerogel that is formed from aggregates of small particles with little visible interstitial porosity， the polyimide aerogels consisted of a three-dimensional network of polyimide fbers tangled together. This is similar to the morphology of some reported polyimideaerogels.24-26,30 In addition, an increase in the density of polyimide aerogels led to denser fibrillar structure and less pore size.

Pores are usually classifed on the basis of their diameter (orwidth）as micropores(below $2 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ),mesopores (between 2 and $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ ),and macropores (above $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ).44 International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)has developed standards to classify gas adsorption-desorption isotherms and their relationship to the pore size of materials.Figure 4a shows the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption-desorption isotherms of the polyimide aerogels.According to the IUPAC classification, the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption-desorption isotherms of the polyimide aerogels were IUPAC type IV curves,indicating the presence of a significant fraction of mesopores.At high relative pressure $\left( P / P _ { \mathrm { o } } > 0 . 8 \right)$ , the volume of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ adsorbed increased very quickly due to the capillary condensation in mesopores. Since the capillary condensation pressure tends to gradually decrease as the pore size decreases,45 4546 the onset ofa quick increase in the volume of $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ adsorbed moved to lower $P / P _ { \mathrm { o } }$ value as the density of the polyimide aerogel increased. Furthermore, capillary condensation and capillary evaporation often do not take place at the same pressure,which led to the appearance of hysteresis loops.45 The pore size distributions of the polyimide aerogels determined from their desorption curves by the Barret-Joyner-Halenda method are presented in Figure 4b. The sample with lower density showed broader pore size distribution and larger pore size. The average pore diameter in Table l was determined by the $4 V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } } / \sigma$ method, where $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ is the total pore volume per gram of sample and $\sigma$ is the surface area determined by the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method.The surface areas of the polyimide aerogels inferred from their adsorption curves by the BET method were in the range of $3 1 0 { - } 3 \mathbf { \hat { 4 } } 4 \mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } \mathbf { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathbf { g } .$ ，Probably because ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ sorption did not probe large pores,the average pore diameter was lower when $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was calculated from the highest volume of nitrogen adsorbed along the adsorption isotherm than when $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was calculated from the relationship $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } } = \left( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { b u l k } } \right) - \left( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { s k e l e t a l } } \right)$ In addition，when $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } }$ was calculated from the relationship $V _ { \mathrm { T o t a l } } ~ = ~ \left( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { b u l k } } \right) ~ - ~ \left( 1 / \rho _ { \mathrm { s k e l e t a l } } \right) ,$ the average pore diameters agreed well with Figure 4b.

$2 0 0 \textrm { g }$ weight without any deformation，indicating that the prepared polyimide aerogels were also robust.The stress-strain curves obtained from the compression test of the polyimide aerogels are shown in Figure Sb.They exhibited a short linear range at the initial stage of compression $( < 1 0 \% )$ .Then，the compressive stress increased slowly with increasing strain (in the range of $1 0 \mathrm { - } 6 0 \% )$ ，in analogy to other polyimide and polric strain, the polyimide fbers were squeezed closer to one another and the pore size decreased.During the late stage of the compression test $\left( > 6 0 \% \right)$ , the pores were substantially closed and the stress increased quickly.Different from pure silica aerogel, which shatters into many tiny fragments after compression, the polyimide aerogels remained in a single piece and turned into a dense solid after application of a large compressive load.Figure S5 of the Supporting Information shows the SEM micrograph of sample 2 after $8 0 \%$ compression strain as an example.In fact, except for linear polyimide aerogels prepared by supercritical drying of polyimide gels synthesized from a dianhydride and a diisocyanate，most of the polyimide aerogels have a good mechanical property $^ { 2 5 , 3 0 - 3 2 }$ Among them，the compressive stresses at about $8 0 \%$ strain of about $0 . 4 3 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ cross-linked polyimide aerogels synthesized from dianhydrides and triisocyanates were above $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { M P a } ,$ ，which was more than twice the strength of the same density sample in the literature.31

The TGA curves under an air atmosphere of the polyimide aerogels are shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information. Their S wt $\%$ loss temperatures were in the range of $4 2 5 { \mathrm { - } } 4 5 0 { } ^ { \circ } { \mathrm { C } } $ After TGA measurement, about 7.5 wt $\%$ white degradation product was left. It was the trimethoxysilane side groups on polyimide that formed cross-linked $_ { \mathrm { S i - O - S i } }$ network structure in the polyimide aerogels after the hydrolysis and condensation reactions. If the trimethoxysilane side groups hydrolyzed and condensed completely，the weight percent of element silicon in the polyimide aerogels was 3.85 wt $\%$ .In addition, $\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ is the principal degradation product under an air atmosphere for siloxane-contained polymers.4748 For these reasons， the theoretical residue of $\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ was 8.24 wt $\%$ ,which was close to the true value.

DMTA measurement of a dense polyimide film prepared from evaporating the DMF in polyimide gel slowlywas carried out to monitor the effect of cross-linking on the thermomechanical property of the polyimide aerogels.It is known that the commercialized polyimide developed by General Electric Co. in 1986 under the trademark Ultem is synthesized from BPADA and $m$ -phenylenediamine.49 The prepared polyimide aerogels had the same backbone structure as Ultem. So, for comparison, the DMTA measurement of Ultem was also conducted.

Figure 6. Storage modulus versus temperature curves and loss tangent (tan $\delta ^ { \bullet }$ ）versus temperature curves of the polyimide cross-linked by trimethoxysilane side groups and Ultemas determined byDMTA in air.

The storage modulus versus temperature curves and loss tangent (tan $\delta$ ）versus temperature curves determined by DMTA are shown in Figure 6. The glass transition temperature $( T _ { \mathrm { g } } )$ was identified by the peak temperature of the tan $\delta$ versus temperature curves.The $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ of Ultem was $2 1 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ and there was a significant fall in its storage modulus on passing through the $T _ { \mathrm { g } } ,$ but for the polyimide cross-linked by trimethoxysilane side groups，the cross-linked structure enhanced its thermal stability.As a result， the polyimide cross-linked by trimethoxysilane side groups exhibited much higher storage modulus at high temperature and $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ $( 3 4 9 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ than Ultem. The good thermal stability of polyimide cross-linked by trimethoxysilane side groups had a positive effect on the heat resistance of the polyimide aerogels.As shown in Figure 7，even after being heated at $3 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ in air,the porous structure of sample 1 was not completely destroyed.

# CONCLUSION

In this study, we introduced a new route to prepare polyimide aerogels.Trimethoxysilanes that could hydrolyze and condense one another to form the cross-linked $_ { \mathrm { S i - O - S i } }$ network structure were incorporated into the polyimide chain as side groups. The cross-linked structure was confirmed by rheology and $^ { \mathrm { 4 9 } } \mathrm { S i }$ solid-state NMR to form and develop in the polyimide solution after adding water and acid catalyst.Although the polyimide aerogels showed high shrinkage (ranging from 43 to $4 6 \%$ ）during fabrication, the majority of shrinkage was observed during aging, indicating the formation of a highly cross-linked network structure in the polyimide gel. The polyimide aerogels had high surface area, small pore size,and a good mechanical property,and the pore size could be tuned simply by adjusting the concentration of the polyimide containing trimethoxysilane side groups in DMF.The approach has significant advantages over previous approaches used to prepare polyimide aerogels. First，complete imidization of the polyimide aerogels was achieved by a thermal treatment before gelation,avoiding the need for chemical imidization reagents and the problem of incomplete imidization. Second,a high cross-linking degree of thepolyimide aerogels wasattained.Therefore,they exhibited high thermal stability.
