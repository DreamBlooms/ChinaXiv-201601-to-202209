Abstract: Overgrazing is regarded as one of the key factors of vegetation and soil degradation in the arid and semi-rid regions of Northwest China. Grazing exclusion (GE) is one of the most common pathways used to restore degraded grasslands and to improve their ecosystem services. Nevertheless,there are stil significant controversies concerning GE's effects on grassland diversity as well as carbon (C) and nitrogen $\mathrm { ( N ) }$ storage. It remains poorly understood in the arid desert regions,whilst being essential for the sustainable use of grassland resources. To assess the effects of GE on community characteristics and C and $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ storage of desert plant community in the arid desert regions,we investigated the community structure and plant biomass,as well as C and $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ storage of plants and soil ( $_ { 0 - 1 0 0 \mathrm { c m } }$ depth) in short-term GE (three years) plots and adjacent long-term freely grazing (FG) plots in the areas of sagebrush desert in Northwest China,which are important both for spring-autumn seasonal pasture and for ecological conservation. Our findings indicated that GE was beneficial to the average height， coverage and aboveground biomass(including stems,leaves and inflorescences,and liter)of desert plant community, to the species richness and importance values of subshrubs and perennial herbs,and to the biomass C and N storage of aboveground parts $_ { ( P < 0 . 0 5 ) }$ . However,GE was not beneficial to the importance values of annual herbs,root/shoot ratio and total $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ concentration in the O-5 and $5 { - } 1 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ soil layers $_ { ( P < 0 . 0 5 ) }$ Additionally, the plant density, belowground biomass,and soil organic Cconcentration and C storage in the $0 { - } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ soil layer could not be significantly changed by short-term GE (three years). The results suggest that,although GE was not beneficial for C sequestration in the sagebrush desert ecosystem, it is an effective strategy for improving productivity,diversity,and C and N storage of plants.As a result, GE can be used to rehabilitate degraded grasslands in the arid desert regions of Northwest China.

# 1 Introduction

Grassland ecosystems are primarily distributed in both the arid and semi-arid regions,and occupy more than $30 \%$ of the global land surface (Shi et al.，2O14). They play an essential role in maintaining the balance between primary productivity and herbivores (Feng et al., 2O1O).As well as primary productivity, they provide substantial additional ecosystem functions,such as diversity maintenance,soil and water protection,and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration (Zhang et al.,2015; Ebrahimi et al., 2016; Fu and Shen, 2017;Fu et al.,2018). The main method of grassand utilization worldwide is grazing (Dong et al.， 2011)，which can alter community structure and affect C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage (Mcsherry and Ritchie，2013； Sigcha et al.，2018). Continuous overgrazing and poor management could induce severe grassland degradation and pose an increasing threat to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity (Shao et al.,2Ol6). Dramatic degradation of grassland significantly reduces primary productivity and simultaneously causes substantial ecological problems， such as biodiversity loss and reduction of C sequestration capacity (El-Keblawy， 2O17). The worsening degradation has led to various efforts being implemented around the world that aim to eliminate the negative effect of overgrazing,such as excluding grazers, reseeding and changing land use practices. A common approach to stimulate self-recovery is by grazing exclusion (GE)，which is now widely viewed as one of the most efficient ways to reverse grassland degradation (Bi et al., 2O18; Wang et al., 2018).

In previous studies,the effects of GE on plant community characteristics,soil organic carbon (SOC）and soil total nitrogen (STN） stocks have not been conclusive，and there remains considerable uncertainty about the effects of GE on biomass C and N allocations (Hu et al.,2016; Bi et al.， 2O18).With respect to productivity，some studies have found that there were no significant differences in plant biomass between freely grazing (FG) and GE regions (Fu et al., 2014;Dong et al.，2O17)，whereas others showed that GE markedly restored vegetation and enhanced productivity of degraded grassands (Wu et al.， 2O09; Jing et al.,2O14; Wang et al., 2018).Additionally, some research has indicated that GE was conducive to the maintenance of plant species diversity (Zhao and Gillt,2O11; Mekuria and Aynekulu, 2O13; Zhang and Zhao, 2015),whereas others reported no change and even a decrease of species diversity, due to litter accumulation altering access to light, water and competitive exclusion of species (Wu et al., 2009; Bi et al.,2O18; Sigcha et al.,2O18). Similarly,the effects of GE on soil nutrients are controversial. For instance, GE produces diverse results on SOC, with evidence of positive (Wu et al., 2010; Qiu et al.,2013; Li et al.,2014), negative (Lu et al.,2015; Bi et al.,2018) or neutral (Dong et al.,2012) effects.Hu et al.(2016) reported that 299 out of a total 326 (i.e., $9 2 \%$ ）measurements with GE showed increases of SOC storage in China. Additionally, GE is mainly concentrated in vulnerable areas of North and Southwest China, especially in the semi-arid grasslands of Inner Mongolia Plateau (Wu et al.,2O14) and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Wu et al.,2O15). Nevertheless,the effects of GE on grassland community structure and functioning in the arid desert regions of Northwest China remain poorly studied, especially in the sagebrush desert. Therefore, it is important to understanding the responses of the essential characteristics of desert ecosystems to GE.

Sagebrush desert covers more than $4 \%$ of the desert region in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of Northwest China. It is a vital spring-autumn seasonal pasture and plays an important foundation for the development of local animal husbandry (Dong et al., 2O17). However, the dramatic degradation of the desert in relation to human disturbance and extreme drought causes a series of ecological problems that hinder the growth of vegetation. GE is a common approach to restoring the degraded sagebrush desert. In this study, we compared the desert plant community structure and productivity, as well as C and $\mathrm { \bf N }$ storage in plants and soil in the sagebrush desert of Xinjiang under FG and GE conditions. The specific objectives of the study were (1) to investigate the effects of GE on vegetation community structure,productivity,and C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage; and (2) to evaluate the responses of SOC and STN concentrations and storage characteristics to GE. The results can be used as a basis for grassland restoration and scientific management in the arid desert regions of China as well as other similar areas in the world.

# 2.1 Study area

This study was conducted in Manas County ( $. 4 4 ^ { \circ } 0 1 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ $8 6 ^ { \circ } 0 9 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E }$ ：， $1 0 3 3 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ a.s.l.) and Hutubi County $( 4 3 ^ { \circ } 5 8 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ ， $8 6 ^ { \circ } 3 2 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E }$ ： $9 7 8 { \mathrm { ~ m } }$ a.s.l.),which are both representative of sagebrush desert in Xinjiang of Northwest China.The study area extends from the north of the Tianshan Mountains to the south of the Junggar Basin. It has a typical temperate continental arid climate characterized by short, hot summers and long,cold winters with harsh environment and extremely fragile ecosystems (Dong et al.,2017). The mean annual precipitation (MAP) is about $1 5 0 { - } 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ,of which approximately $60 \%$ falls from April to August. The annual mean temperature(AMT) is about $6 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { - } 8 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .The soil type is belonging to gray desert soil according to the FAO/UNESCO taxonomy.

Sagebrush desert regions in Manas County and Hutubi County had similar plant species composition and land use history. They were employed as the spring-autumn pasture and grazed by sheep at a moderate grazing intensity (0.6-1.O sheep/hm²） before GE (Dong et al.,2016). Seriphidium transiliense is a dominant constructive species in the studied sagebrush desert regions,while the companion species include Petrosimonia sibirica, Carex turkestanica, Kochia prostrata, Ceratocarpus arenarius and Salsola collina.

# 2.2 Experimental design

In 2015,we established two experimental sites in the sagebrush desert regions of Manas County and Hutubi County,which were abbreviated as MNS and HTB,respectively.The details of the two sites are shown in Table 1. At each site, one paired short-term GE plot and adjacent long-term FG plot were selected. Livestock were completely excluded from the GE plots of MNS and HTB with metal fences,and the FG plots were grazed by sheep in spring and autumn. The desert plant community composition and structure, topographic features and other environmental conditions in the GE plots are basically consistent with the FG plots in both MNS and HTB,and the terrain is flat in all plots.

# 2.3 Field sampling and laboratory analysis

Vegetation measurements and soil sampling were conducted in late September 2O17, which was a typical period of peak aboveground biomass (AGB). In each plot， three random sampling transects were chosen at $1 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ intervals,then five sampling quadrats ( $( 1 \mathrm { m } { \times } 1 \mathrm { m } )$ at $1 0 \mathrm { m }$ intervals along each transect were established.In all 6O quadrats (2 sites $\mathbf { \nabla } \times 2$ plots $\times 3$ transects $\times 5$ quadrats), the plant species were identified and recorded, followed by the measurements of the height, coverage and number of each species.The aboveground parts and surface litter were harvested, and then the stems,leaves and inflorescences were removed from the whole plant and placed in separate envelopes.To measure the belowground biomass (BGB), we collected soil samples at $0 -$ $1 0 0 \mathrm { c m }$ depth by digging a soil profile in each transect. Roots in the composite soil samples were collected by washing the soil using a $2 \mathrm { - m m }$ sieve.Then, the aboveground parts (stems, leaves and inflorescences,and litter) and belowground parts of all plants were weighted after drying at $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to a constant weight.All plant species were divided into three different functional groups: subshrubs,perennial herbs and annual herbs.

Three representative soil profiles were dug along a diagonal direction in each plot. Soil bulk density was measured by using soil cores ( $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ volume; $5 . 1 \mathrm { c m }$ high and $5 . 0 \mathrm { c m }$ in diameter) at seven depths(0-5,5-10,10-20,20-30,30-50,50-70 and $7 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 \ { \mathrm { c m } } ,$ ）in three sides of each profile. Similarly,soil samples were obtained by spade from the same seven depths in three sides of each profile,then the soil samples from the same layers of each profile were mixed. This produced a more representative set of 84 samples (2 sites $\times 2$ plots $\times 3$ profiles $\times 7$ soil layers),which were used to evaluate the mass of SOC and STN.All soil samples were air-dried at room temperature after removing the fresh roots and other plant residues,then hand-sieved through a $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { - m m }$ sieve after grinding (Wu et al.,2014; Bi et al., 2018).

In the laboratory, plant C and SOC concentrations were determined using the Walkley-Black dichromate oxidation method,and plant $\mathsf { N }$ and STN concentrations were determined using the indophenol blue colorimetry and nesslerization methods,respectively (Bao,2000).

# 2.4 Data analysis

# 2.4.1Plant and soil parameters

The plant species diversity was described by the Patrick richness index $( R )$ , the Shannon-Wiener diversity index $( H )$ and the Pielou evenness index $( E )$ (Wu et al., 20o9),which were calculated by the following formulas:

$\scriptstyle { \mathrm { I V } } =$ (relative height+relative coverage+relative density+relative biomass)/4,

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { R = S , } } \\ { { H = - { \displaystyle \sum } P _ { i } \ln { P _ { i } } , \hfill } } \\ { { E = H / \ln { S } , \hfill } } \end{array}
$$

where IV is the importance value of a species; $S$ is the number of species in the community;and $P _ { i }$ is a representation of the importance value of the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ species.

Plant C storage $( \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } )$ and $\mathbf { N }$ storage $( \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } )$ were calculated according to the method of Fang et al. (2007) as follows:

$$
{ \mathrm { C ~ s t o r a g e } } = \sum ( { \mathrm { B C } } _ { i } \times { \mathrm { B i o m a s s } } _ { i } \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ) ,
$$

$$
\mathrm { ~ N \ s t o r a g e = \sum ( B N } _ { i } \times \mathrm { B i o m a s s } _ { i } \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ) ,
$$

where $\mathbf { B C } _ { i }$ and $\mathbf { B N } _ { i }$ are the $\mathbf { C }$ and $\mathbf { N }$ concentrations of the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ component of plant species $( { \mathrm { g } } / { \mathrm { k g } } )$ respectively; and Biomass is the biomass of the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ component of plant species (g).

We calculated SOC storage $( \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } )$ and STN storage $( \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } )$ according to the method of Shrestha and Stahl (2008) as follows:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathrm { S O C ~ s t o r a g e } = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { S O C } _ { i } \times \mathbf { B D } _ { i } \times ( 1 - \theta \mathcal { H } _ { o } ) \times H _ { i } \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } , } \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathrm { S T N \ s t o r a g e } = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { S T N } _ { i } \times \mathbf { B D } _ { i } \times ( 1 - \theta \mathcal { H } _ { o } ) \times H _ { i } \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } , } \end{array}
$$

where $\mathbf { S } \mathbf { O C } _ { i }$ and $\mathbf { S T N } _ { i }$ are the SOC and STN concentrations in different soil layers $( \mathrm { g / k g ) }$ respectively; and $\mathbf { B D } _ { i }$ ， $H _ { i }$ and $\theta \%$ are the bulk density $\mathrm { ( g / c m ^ { 3 } ) }$ ,the thickness of the $i ^ { \mathrm { t h } } ( i { = } 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,$ （20 5,6 and 7) soil layer (cm) and the percentage of rock fragments ( $> 2 \mathrm { m m }$ diameter),respectively.

# 2.4.2 Statistical analyses

Analysis of allthe data was performed with the SPSS 20.O software (IBM, Chicago,IL,USA) and Sigmaplot 10.O (SYSTAT, California, San Jose, USA). After a normal distribution test for all the data,we performed a paired-sample $t { \cdot }$ -test to identify significant differences of community characteristics， plant diversity indices， $\mathrm { ~ \cal ~ C ~ }$ and $\mathbf { N }$ storage of plants (stems，leaves and inflorescences,litter and root）and soil（ $\mathrm { 0 - 1 0 0 ~ c m }$ depth）between GE and FG plots,therefore assessed the effects of GE on vegetation and soil properties.Evaluation of the significance for all the statistical tests was carried out at $\scriptstyle P = 0 . 0 5$ level.

# 3.1 Plant community structure

Changes in plant community structure in the sagebrush desert regions are shown in Table 2. In the GE plots,the average vegetation heights in MNS and HTB were 12.75 and $2 9 . 1 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ higher $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ than those in the FG plots, respectively; and the total vegetation coverage values were $3 1 . 7 8 \%$ and $6 0 . 5 6 \%$ higher $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ than those in the FG plots,respectively. A significant difference in the diversity index was found in MNS and in the richness index in HTB,indicating that GE increased the biodiversity of sagebrush desert. However, GE did not significantly affect the total density of plant species $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ . There were also no significant differences in the richness index between FG and GE plots in MNS,the diversity index in HTB,and the evenness index in both MNS and HTB.

In MNS and HTB,the average plant height, coverage, density and importance values of different functional groups in the GE and FG plots are shown in Table 3.In MNS,the average plant height and coverage of subshrubs in the GE plot were significantly greater (1.39 and 2.21 times,respectively) than those in the FG plot $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ . GE significantly increased the importance values of perennial herbs,whereas it decreased the importance values of annual herbs.

Grassland productivity was described using AGB and BGB in this study. GE significantly increased AGB in both MNS and HTB( $_ { \it P < 0 . 0 5 }$ ； Table 4).However, the responses of BGB to GE in MNS and HTB were inconsistent $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ . In MNS,the biomasses of stems,leaves and inflorescences，and litter in the GE plot were increased by $56 . 6 \%$ ， $7 1 . 3 \%$ ，and $1 4 7 . 9 \%$ ， respectively, compared with the FG plot, whereas they increased by $4 8 8 . 3 \%$ ， $2 0 6 . 7 \%$ ，and $6 9 . 2 \%$ in HTB,respectively. Additionally, the root/shoot ratio significantly decreased by $5 7 . 7 \%$ in MNS and $7 7 . 4 \%$ in HTB after GE $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ ：

# 3.3Plant C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage

As shown in Figures la and b, the biomass C storage of aboveground parts after GE significantly increased in MNS $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ ，while the biomass C storage of belowground parts decreased after GE but the difference was not significant $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ . A large proportion of the total plant C storage was maintained in the belowground parts in both FG and GE plots $( 8 6 . 3 \%$ and $7 5 . 8 \%$ ， respectively). The C storage of stems,leaves and inflorescences,and litter in the whole desert plant community respectively accounted for $1 5 . 0 \%$ ， $6 . 8 \%$ ,and $2 . 5 \%$ of the total plant C storage in the GE plot and $9 . 2 \%$ $3 . 7 \%$ ,and $0 . 8 \%$ of the total plant C storage in the FG plot (Fig. 1a).

Additionally, GE significantly increased the biomass $\mathbf { N }$ storage of aboveground parts in MNS, whereas there was a slight non-significant decrease in the biomass $\mathbf { N }$ storage of belowground parts after GE (Fig. 1b). The $\mathbf { N }$ storage of stems,leaves and inflorescences，litter and belowground parts of desert plant community respectively accounted for $7 . 4 \%$ ， $4 . 7 \%$ ， $1 . 4 \%$ and $8 6 . 5 \%$ of the total $\mathbf { N }$ storage in the GE plot and $2 . 9 \%$ ， $2 . 4 \%$ ， $0 . 4 \%$ and $9 4 . 3 \%$ of the total $\mathbf { N }$ storage in the FG plot (Fig.1b).

In HTB,the biomass C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage levels of aboveground parts in the GE plots were significantly higher (4.61 and 3.49 times,respectively) than those in the FG plots ( $_ { ( P < 0 . 0 5 }$ ; Figs. 1c and d). There was a slight but non-significant decrease in the biomass C storage of belowground parts after GE,while the biomass $\mathbf { N }$ storage of belowground parts significantly decreased $( P { < } 0 . 0 5$ ： Fig.ld). The biomass C storage of belowground parts in the GE and FG plots accounted for the majority of the total plant C storage $( 5 6 . 3 \%$ and $8 5 . 6 \%$ ，respectively） in HTB.After GE,the C storage proportions of stems, leaves and inflorescences，and liter of desert plant community changed from $7 . 6 \%$ to $3 0 . 5 \%$ ， $5 . 2 \%$ to $1 1 . 2 \%$ ，and $1 . 6 \%$ to $2 . 0 \%$ ,respectively (Fig.lc). The $\mathbf { N }$ storage allocations in different parts of plant were similar to the trends in C storage allocations.

# 3.4 Concentration and storage of SOC and STN

SOC and STN concentrations in different soil layers in the FG and GE plots in MNS and HTB are shown in Figure 2. GE did not significantly change the SOC concentration in any of the tested soil layers in both MNS and HTB( ${ \it P } { > } 0 . 0 5$ ; Figs.2a and c).However, compared to the FG plots, the STN concentration in the O-5 and $5 { - } 1 0 \mathrm { c m }$ soil layers was significantly reduced by $3 4 . 5 \%$ and $2 4 . 4 \%$ ，respectively,after GE in MNS $( P { < } 0 . 0 5$ ； Fig. 2b)，and reduced by $3 6 . 8 \%$ and $3 7 . 2 \%$ respectively，after GE in HTB( $_ { ( P < 0 . 0 5 }$ ； Fig. 2d). Additionally, the soil C/N ratio was not significantly different between GE and FG plots in both MNS and HTB ( ${ \cdot } P { > } 0 . 0 5$ ; Fig. 3).

In MNS, the responses of SOC and STN storage to GE in the topsoil layer $( 0 { - } 1 0 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ were low $( P { > } 0 . 0 5$ ; Table 5). The SOC storage in the O-5 and $5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 ~ { \mathrm { c m } }$ soil layers were reduced by $2 3 . 4 \%$ and $7 . 6 \%$ after GE，respectively，and the STN storage was reduced by $3 1 . 9 \%$ and $2 6 . 0 \%$ respectively. There was no significant difference in the SOC or STN storage of the whole O-100 cm soil layer $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ . Additionally, in HTB,the SOC and STN storage in the $0 { - } 5 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ soil layer after GE decreased by $8 . 2 \%$ and $4 3 . 3 \%$ ,respectively, and the SOC and STN storage in the whole $0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 \ { \mathrm { c m } }$ soil layer also slightly decreased by $1 7 . 9 \%$ and $3 4 . 8 \%$ $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ ,respectively.

# 4Discussion

# 4.1Responses of desert plant community structure to GE

The response of vegetation community structure and characteristics to GE is variable in different grassland ecosystems (Guo, 2OO7; Marriott et al., 2OO9). The average height and total coverage of plant species are important factors used to evaluate the health of the grasslands (Xiong et al., 2014). The present study showed that three years of GE can have a significant positive effect on the height and coverage of desert plants in the two sites (MNS and HTB; Table 2),a result which is supported by previous studies in other grassland types (Jing et al., 2O14; Wang et al., 2016; Bi et al.,2018; Fu et al.，2O18). One reasonable explanation for this result is that frequent heavy grazing or overgrazing inhibits the growth of the dominant species (Seriphidium transiliense) due to both the feeding and trampling of livestock,and that GE benefits the regeneration both of plant species and soil seed bank, enhancing the ability of grasslands to recover (Wang et al.,2016). Additionally， GE can alter the species composition due to selective grazing by livestock (Golodets et al.,2O1O). In our study, GE increased the average height, coverage and importance values of subshrubs and perennial herbs,whereas it decreased those values amongst annual herbs (Table 3). Most of subshrubs (e.g., Seriphidium transiliense and Kochia prostrata) and perennial herbs (e.g., Carex turkestanica) are palatable.They were prioritized by livestock for consumption and then regenerated after GE (Bi et al.， 2O18). The previously suppressed species rapidly increased and occupied a large amount of light and space resources, thus restraining the less competitive annuals. Another interpretation of the mechanism is that C. turkestanica is a perennial grass that can be reproduced by rhizomes,which is a mechanism that is favored over the sexual reproduction of other species on the removal of grazing pressures.

GE had positive or non-significant efects on richness,diversity and evenness indices in the two sites (Table 2). Yayneshet et al. (2O09) reported similar findings from semi-arid, grass-wood mixed grassands after GE of more than five years,and their study showed that species diversity increased compared to grazed land. However, some opposite findings were reported in other similar studies (Wu et al., 2OO9). The findings were related to the promotion of plants' ability to reproduce by removing the disturbance from livestock (Sternberg et al.,2Ooo).Palatable grasses had greater competitiveness than unpalatable species after GE (Gallego et al., 2OO4). Therefore, GE promoted the growth of suppressed species，which may explain why it enhanced species richness in deserts, mountain meadows (Bi et al.,2O18)and alpine grasslands (Wu et al., 2010).

# 4.2Responses of desert plant productivity to GE

Biomass is often regarded as a good approximation of grassland productivity (Yan and Lu, 2015). GE significantly enhanced the AGB of desert plant community in the two experimental sites (Table 4).AGB increased markedly in the GE plots,mainly due to the absence of feeding and trampling by livestock (Schönbach et al.,2011; Deng et al.,2014a; Dong et al.,2017). In the FG plots,the continuous removal of stems, leaves and inflorescences by livestock results in the degradation of aboveground parts,including the standing and litter biomass (Schonbach et al., 2011).

Nevertheless,there are controversies in previous work on the effects of GE on BGB. Some studies showed that GE with fencing increased the BGB (Deng et al.,2O14b; Cheng et al., 2016) due to grazing removed plant tissues and thus decreased the size of carbon-assimilating organs (Gao et al., 2O09). Others have observed that the response of BGB to GE showed no change or even a significant decrease (Wang et al.,2O16; Bi et al.,2O18). One reasonable explanation is that plants adapt to grazing by decreasing the energy outflow from AGB to herbivores，actively directing more assimilation to BGB as a storage for regeneration (Hafner et al.，2012). Consequently, the BGB is lower in the GE plots than in the FG plots.In the present study,GE did not obviously alter the BGB in either MNS or HTB $( P { > } 0 . 0 5$ ； Table 4). The reason for the conflicting findings in previous cases likely relates to differences in environmental conditions, grassland types,duration of GE and other factors (Luan et al.,2O14; Shen et al., 2O16; Xiong et al., 2016).

# 4.3 Effects of GE on plant C and N storage

Plant C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage levels are dependent on AGB and BGB (Wang et al., 2O16). In this study, we found that the biomass C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage levels of aboveground parts after three years of GE in MNS and HTB were higher than those in the FG plots $( P { < } 0 . 0 5$ ; Fig. 1). Wang et al. (2014) also indicated that GE enhanced the C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage of AGB after eight years of GE. One possible explanation is that the recovery and regeneration of vegetation after GE increase the vegetation C and N storage, which is consistent with other experiments (Wu et al.,2O1O; Bi et al.,2O18). In the present study, the biomass C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage levels of belowground parts were reduced or showed no change in the GE plots compared to those in the FG plots (Fig.1).The results were consistent with other studies (Qiu et al., 2013; Deng et al.,2014b).Additionally, the C and $\mathrm { \bf N }$ pools in the belowground parts of plant in both MNS and HTB were larger than those in the aboveground parts.The pattern was related to the high decomposability of shoot material (stems,leaves and inflorescences) compared to roots (Dodd and Mackay, 2O11). As a result, BGB has been seen as vital for C and N belowground sinks (Wu et al., 2010).

# 4.4 Effects of GE on SOC and STN storage

In our research, GE can be summarized as playing an opposite role in preserving soil C in both MNS and HTB,especially on the surface soil layer (Fig. 2; Table 5). Nevertheless, there have been inconsistent findings in previous literature with regard to GE.Noseto et al. (2OO6) observed that 15 years of GE did not increase the SOC storage compared to grazed land. Some other studies also supported the results (Shrestha and Stahl, 2OO8; Medinaroldan et al.,2O12) revealed by our study. Our results suggested that the amount of SOC stored in the soil represents the net balance between the loss and input in SOC pools (Post and Kwon, 2OoO),although the SOC concentration and storage slightly increased in most soil layers.However, most results in the research literature demonstrated that GE significantly enhanced the SOC sequestration (e.g., Pei et al.,2008;Hu et al.,2016). Pei et al. (2008), for example, indicated that the SOC clearly increased in the $0 { - } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ soil layer after only two years of GE due to the removal of livestock disturbance. If the grazing intensity exceeds the carrying capacity of grasslands or crosses an ecological threshold, the SOC can be significantly altered after GE (Sasaki et al.，2011). The inconsistency of these findings is likely related to complicating factors,such as the GE duration, the initial soil conditions,the grassland types,the regional climate and environmental conditions, the community structure of the grasslands and the degree of degradation before GE (Li et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2016).

In this study, GE affected soil $\mathbf { N }$ concentration and storage in a manner similar to soil C concentration and storage in most soil layers in the sagebrush desert.However,GE significantly decreased soil N concentration in the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ soil layer and soil N storage in the whole O-100 cm soil layer in HTB.Shi et al. (2O13） indicated that on the Tibetan Plateau, soil $\mathbf { N }$ storage decreased after GE,which is consistent with our results.However, GE increased soil $\mathbf { N }$ storage in the three headwater resource regions of Tibetan Plateau (Fan et al., 2Ol3). The inconsistency may result from the balance between changes in $\mathbf { N }$ allocation (the $\mathbf { N }$ retention hypothesis）and the ability of soil to maintain the $\mathbf { N }$ available after GE (the loss hypothesis) (Pineiro et al.,2009, 2010).Additionaly, the soil C/N ratio was not significantly different between GE and FG plots in both MNS and HTB $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ ，which indicates a close coupling between soil C and N (Deng et al., 2014b; Wang et al., 2016).

# 5 Conclusions

The objective of the current study was to understand the effectiveness of short-term GE (three years） in restoring degraded sagebrush desert in Northwest China. We investigated mainly the community structure,plant biomass,and C and $\mathsf { N }$ storage of plants and soil ( $_ { ( 0 - 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } }$ depth） in the GE plots and adjacent FG plots. Our findings suggested that GE significantly increased the average height and total coverage of desert plant community，and the height, coverage and importance values of subshrubs and perennial herbs.However, it decreased the importance values of annual herbs. GE is conducive to the maintenance of plant species diversity,as measured by the richness,diversity and evenness indices. Another important finding was that GE altered the biomass allocation. It increased the proportion of stems,leaves and inflorescences,and liter in the GE plots, but decreased the root/shoot ratio,and produced no clear change of AGB.Similarly, GE can increase the biomass C and $\mathbf { N }$ storage of aboveground parts,but did not promote the C and N storage in belowground parts of plants and soil, especially the topsoil layer $( 0 { - } 1 0 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ . In general, GE can effectively help recover the degraded desert grassland,and reverse the trend of vegetation degradation. The study provides a basis for sustainable management strategies of vegetation in the sagebrush desert in the arid regions.
