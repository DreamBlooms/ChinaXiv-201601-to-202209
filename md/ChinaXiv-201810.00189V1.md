Abstract: It is essential to understand the water consumption characteristics and physiological adjustments of tree species under drought conditions,as well as the effects of pure and mixed plantations on these characteristics in semi-arid regions.In this study, the normalized sap flow $( S F _ { \mathrm { { n } } } )$ ，leaf water potential， stomatal conductance $( g _ { \mathrm { s } } )$ ，and photosynthetic rate $( P _ { \mathrm { r } } )$ were monitored for two dominant species,i.e.,Pinus tabuliformis and Hippopbae rhamnoides,in both pure and mixed plantations in a semi-arid region of Chinese Loess Plateau.A threshold-delay model showed that the lower rainfallthresholds $( R ^ { L } )$ （204号 for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides in pure plantations were 9.6 and $1 1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，respectively, and the time lags $( \tau )$ after rainfall were 1.15 and $1 . 7 6 \mathrm { d }$ for corresponding species, respectively. The results indicated that $P .$ tabuliformis was more sensitive to rainfall pulse than $H .$ rhamnoides.In addition,strong stomatal control allowed $P .$ tabuliformis to experience low $g _ { s }$ and $P _ { r }$ in response to drought, while maintaining a high midday leaf water potential $( \psi _ { \mathrm { m } } )$ . However, $H .$ rbamnoides maintained $\mathrm { \ h i g h { \ g _ { s } } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ at a low $\psi _ { \mathrm { m } }$ expense. Therefore, $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides can be considered as isohydric and anisohydric species,respectively. In mixed plantation, the values of $R ^ { L }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides were 6.5 and $8 . 9 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ,respectively; and the values of $\tau$ were 0.86 and $1 . 6 1 \mathrm { d }$ for corresponding species,respectively, which implied that mixed afforestation enhanced the rainfall pulse sensitivity for both two species,especially for $P .$ tabuliformis. In addition,mixed afforestation significantly reduced $S F _ { \mathrm { n } } , \ g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ ，and $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ ，while maintaining a high leaf water potential status. However, no significant effect of mixed afforestation of $H .$ （204号 rbamnoides was observed at the expense of leaf water potential status in response to drought. Although inconsistent physiological responses were adopted by these species，the altered water consumption characteristics, especially for $P .$ tabuliformis indicated that the mixed afforestation requires further investigation.

# 1Introduction

Vegetation restoration and reforestation of degraded land are useful forest management practices for the soil erosion conservation and hydrological regime regulation (Swaffer et al.,2O14; Jian et al., 2015). By increasing biodiversity and the variety of ecological niches, mixed plantations may be more resistant to external disturbances, such as storms or disease atacks,compared with pure plantations (Zapater et al.，2O13； Zhang et al.，2O17). However, vegetation deterioration and ecological degradation have been observed in some mixed plantations because water supplies could not meet the demand for co-existing species, especially in arid and semi-arid regions (Chen et al.,2Oo8; Yang et al., 2Ol5). Some researchers have suggested that water shortage exerts a profound influence on water consumption, integrity of plant hydraulic systems,and carbon assimilation (Franks et al., 2OO7; Silvertown et al.,2O15). Therefore,improved understanding of water consumption and drought tolerance strategies of species grown in pure and mixed plantations is needed to evaluate the most appropriate tree species, planting regimes,and forest management practices that will effectively respond to climate uncertainties in the further (Du et al., 2011).

Rainfall is essential to prevent plant mortality caused by drought (West et al.,2OO7). Analysis of the effect of rainfall pulses on plant water consumption is fundamental to acknowledge species sensitivity to rainfall pulses,as well as how these responses afect species adaptation to their habitats (Zhao and Liu, 2O1O).A threshold-delay model has been widely used to describe the effect of rainfall pulses on plant water consumption (Ogle and Reynolds,2OO4).A threshold level of rainfall stimulates plant water use,and the time lags of tree and shrub responses have been investigated and evaluated by this model (Ivans et al., 2OO6; Zhao and Liu, 2010).

Plants undergo different physiological adjustments in the trade-off among water consumption, leaf water potential, and carbon gain to adapt to frequent drought stress (West et al.，2007; Silvertown et al., 2O15). Several of these adjustments have been studied, including reliance on deep root systems (Yang et al., 2O15), delayed stomatal closure (Tang et al., 2O14), maintenance of high photosynthetic rate (Zhu et al., 2O15),and adjustments in leaf water potential (McDowell et al.,20o8).For example,the classification of isohydric and anisohydric species has been widely used to identify the balance between stomatal control,leaf water potential status,and carbon gain in response to drought conditions (Franks et al., 2Oo7; Zapater et al., 2O13). Isohydric species may experience smaller variations in leaf water potential through stomatal control regardless of carbon gain,whereas anisohydric species maintain stable carbon gain and stomatal conductance $( g _ { s } )$ at the expense of leaf water potential (West et al.,2007). However, Franks et al. (20O7) found that some anisohydric species, such as Eucalyptus gomphocephala, exhibit strong stomatal regulation in response to limited soil water conditions and show isohydrodynamic characteristics. Zapater et al. (2013) attributed this altered physiological characteristics to a trade-off strategy between water consumption and carbon allocation，and they also related it to the root architecture system. Research into the water consumption and root systems,and further investigation into the role of physiological variables,such as leaf water potential, stomatal control,and carbon gain are needed to fully understand plant strategies for drought tolerance.

To overcome severe soil erosion and habitat degradation in Chinese Loess Plateau, government launched the "Grain-for-Green" project in the last decade,and plantations now occupy more than $5 9 \%$ of the region's total forest area (Jian et al.,2O15). Due to their high drought tolerance and economic value,Pinus tabuliformis and Hippophae rhamnoides are the main plantation species planted for ecological restoration in this region (Li et al.,2O16).Mixed afforestation with these two species has also been widely used in the initial plantation stage,as mixed plantations generally show a higher plant survival rate and soil conservation capacity compared with pure plantations (Meng et al.,2Oo8). In addition, evapotranspiration far exceeds annual precipitation in the Loess Plateau,and this imbalance may become acute for plant growth (Chen et al.,2O15; Gao et al.，2O18). Seasonal variations of water consumption under drought conditions for $P .$ （204号 tabuliformis or H. rhamnoides in pure plantations have been investigated in this region (Fang et al.,2016; Jian et al.,2Ol6; Wen et al.,2O17). However, physiological adjustments to drought and the effect of mixed afforestation on water consumption and physiological adjustments of these species have not been investigated.

The year 2O15 was the driest year recorded in the Loess Plateau,with only $5 8 . 9 \%$ of the average precipitation since 1988.For species selection and plantation management practices in this region,variations in water consumption and physiological variables,including stem sap flow $( S F )$ , leaf water potential, $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ ,and photosynthetic rate $( P _ { \mathrm { r } } )$ ，were examined for 14-year-old planted $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ ，rhamnoides in pure and mixed plantations in 2O15.The objectives were to (1） investigate the rainfall pulse sensitivities and physiological adjustments of the two species under drought conditions in pure plantations，and (2） identify whether water consumption characteristics and physiological adjustments for specific species were altered in mixed plantation.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1 Study area and description of plantations

The study was conducted at the Ansai Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences $( 3 6 . 5 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { N }$ $1 0 9 . 1 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { E }$ ， $1 2 3 1 \mathrm { m }$ a.s.l.) in the central part of the Chinese Loess Plateau.The climate is temperate semi-arid,with mean annual precipitation of 492.7 $( \pm 1 2 9 . 4 )$ mm and annual mean air temperature of $1 0 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ （ $( \pm 0 . 5 ) ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，according to the meteorological records during the period 1988-2015 in Ansai County. The loess in this region is characterized as silt loam with a depth of $5 0 \mathrm { - } 1 9 0 ~ \mathrm { m }$ depending on topography, with low organic carbon and nutrient contents (Xu et al., 2010).

Three adjacent plantations planted in 2OO2 were selected, i.e., a pure $P .$ tabuliformis plantation, a pure $H _ { ☉ }$ ，rhamnoides plantation,and a $P .$ tabuliformis $H _ { \cdot }$ ，rhamnoides mixed plantation.A study plot of $2 0 \mathrm { m } { \times } 2 0 \mathrm { m }$ was established for each plantation type.The plantation density was typical of the central part of the Loess Plateau,i.e.，stem densities were 1667 stems. $\scriptstyle \mathtt { \dim } ^ { 2 }$ in pure $P .$ tabuliformis plantation，and 10,ooO stems $/ \mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ in pure $H .$ ，rhamnoides plantation,respectively. The stem densities in the corresponding mixed plantations were 111l and 3333 stems/hm2, respectively.

According to a plot survey conducted in July 2O15, the stem densities of $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ （204号 rhamnoides in pure plantations were 1175 and 190O stems $/ \mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ ，respectively. The average height was 3.39 (±O.47） m, average trunk diameter at breast height $( 1 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m } )$ was $5 9 . 5 \ ( \pm 2 . 3 ) \ \mathrm { m m }$ and average canopy radius was 1.41 $( \pm 0 . 2 8 )$ m for $P .$ tabuliformis.The average height was 3.3 $\Vdash ( \pm 0 . 5 8 )$ （204号 m,average trunk diameter at ground height $( 0 . 3 { \mathrm { ~ m } } )$ was $5 1 . 1 \ ( \pm 1 . 7 ) \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and average canopy radius was 0.95 $( \pm 0 . 3 5 )$ m for $H .$ rhamnoides.From June to August 2O15, the average leaf area index (LAI) was $1 . 7 8 \ ( \pm 0 . 1 7 ) \ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ in $P .$ tabuliformis pure plantation and $1 . 8 1 \ ( \pm 0 . 5 4 ) \ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ in H.rhamnoides pure plantation, respectively, according to monthly monitored values using an LAI-200O plant canopy analyzer (LI-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). The dominant herbaceous species were Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Bothriochloa ischaemum in pure $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides plantations,respectively.

In mixed plantation, the stem densities of $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ ，rhamnoides were 85O and 1775 stems $/ \bar { \mathrm { h m } } ^ { 2 }$ ，respectively. The average height was $3 . 6 8 \ ( \pm 0 . 3 9 ) \ \mathrm { m }$ ，average trunk diameter was $6 2 . 7 \ ( \pm 1 . 8 ) \ \mathrm { \ m m }$ ，and average canopy radius was $1 . 2 6 \ ( \pm 0 . 2 9 ) \textrm { m }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis. The average height was 3.13 $( \pm 0 . 4 7 ) \textrm { m }$ ， average trunk diameter was $5 3 . 6 ~ ( \pm 1 . 9 ) ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and average canopy radius was 0.93 $( \pm 0 . 3 6 ) \mathrm { m }$ for $H .$ rhamnoides.From June to August 2O15, the average LAI was 2 $\mathrm { : } 0 6 ( \pm 0 . 3 6 ) \ : \ : \mathrm { \ m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ in mixed plantation. The dominant herbaceous species were $B$ ischaemum and Artemisia gmelinii in mixed plantation.

# 2.2 Environmental variables

Meteorological variables have been measured less than $4 0 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ from the selected plantation plots since 1999. Half hourly net radiation $( R _ { \mathrm { n } } )$ （Model CNR-1，Kipp & Zonen Inc.，Delft,The Netherlands), air relative humidity and temperature (HMP45C, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA), rainfal amount (Model 522O3,RM Young Inc., Traverse City,MI, USA),and soil heat flux (Model HFPO1, Campbell Scientific Inc., UAS） were measured and stored using a CR1000 datalogger (Campbell Scientific Inc.， USA). The soil water content (SWC） was continuously monitored at depths of 10,20,50,100,and $1 5 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ in the three plantation plots using EM50 (Decagon Inc., Pullman,WA,USA).

Daily potential evapotranspiration $\left( \mathrm { E T _ { P } , m m } \right)$ ）was calculated as follows (Priestley and Taylor, 1972):

$$
\mathrm { E T _ { P } } = 1 . 2 6 ( ( R _ { \mathrm { n } } - G ) s ) / ( s + \gamma ) ,
$$

where $R _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ and $G$ are the net radiation $( \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } )$ and soil heat flux $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } )$ ,respectively; $s$ is the slope of a function relating saturation vapor pressure to temperature $\mathrm { ( k P a / K ) }$ ; and $\gamma$ is the psychrometric constant $\left( \mathrm { k P a } / \mathrm { K } \right)$ ：

# 2.3 Sap flow measurements

Using Granier-type thermal dissipation probes (TDP） following Granier (1987)， $S F$ was monitored in a total of 25 individuals for these species during the growing season, from 5 June (DOY (day of the year) 156) to 26 September (DOY 269),2015 (Table 1). To preserve the monitored trees,we established the equation between trunk diameter and sapwood width based on 20 unmonitored individual core samples for each species. Core samples were obtained using an increment borer, and the color difference between sapwood and heartwood was large.

In pure plantation,7 individuals of $P$ .tabuliformis were selected with a trunk diameter of $4 2 \mathrm { - } 6 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and a canopy radius of $1 . 0 1 { - } 1 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { m }$ .Six individuals were selected for $H .$ rhamnoides with a trunk diameter of $3 6 { - } 6 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and a canopy radius of $0 . 8 4 \mathrm { - } 1 . 1 7$ . In mixed plantation, it was important to select individuals of $H .$ rhamnoides that were adjacent to selected individuals of $P$ tabuliformis, because one objective of this study was to identify the mixed plantation effect on water consumption and physiological adjustments for these two species. First, we selected 6 individuals of $P$ ，tabuliformis with a trunk diameter of $4 3 { - } 7 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ and a canopy radius of $1 . 1 8 \mathrm { - } 1 . 4 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ . Each $H .$ . rhamnoides was selected within $2 \mathrm { m }$ of a trunk of $P _ { \cdot }$ . tabuliformis, creating 6 pairs (Fig. S1). The 6 selected $H .$ rhamnoides individuals had a trunk diameter of $3 8 \mathrm { - } 6 7 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and a canopy radius of $0 . 8 9 { - } 1 . 2 4 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ The $2 { \cdot } \mathrm { m }$ radius was used to ensure potential interactions between $P _ { \cdot }$ ，tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides individuals.In our earlier work,it had been shown that the majority of lateral roots distance for $P _ { \cdot }$ ，tabuliformis and $H _ { \ l }$ ，rhamnoides extended twice the distance of the corresponding canopy radius. The minimum canopy radius for selected $P$ tabuliformis individuals was $1 . 1 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ； therefore,it was calculated that the minimum radius of the majority of lateral roots was approximately $2 . 3 6 \mathrm { m }$

A pair of TDPs of the diameters of 1O and $2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ was used for both $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ （204号 rhamnoides,respectively.The probes were uniformly and horizontally installed on the north side of the trunks at breast and ground heights for selected $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides individuals.The probes were packaged in aluminum foil to prevent thermal influences from ambient environmental variation.The $S F$ data were measured at $3 0 ~ \mathrm { s }$ intervals and stored as half hour averages using a CR10oo data logger (Campbell Scientific Inc., USA） with an AM16/32A multiplexer (Campbell Scientific Inc.,USA).

The standard sap flux density $( F _ { \mathrm { d } } , \ \mathrm { g } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { s } ) )$ can be calculated according to the equation suggested by Granier (1987):

$$
F _ { \mathrm { d } } = 1 1 9 \left( \left( \Delta T _ { \mathrm { M } } - \Delta T \right) / \Delta T \right) ^ { 1 . 2 3 1 } ,
$$

where $\Delta { T _ { \mathrm { M } } }$ is the maximum temperature $( ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ；and $\Delta T$ is the temperature difference between unheated and heated probes $( ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$

The probe length was longer than the sapwood thickness of some sampled trees.To avoid the underestimation of $F _ { \mathrm { d } }$ ，weused the corrected values $( \Delta T _ { \mathrm { C } } )$ rather than the measured values $( \Delta T )$ in these trees (Clearwater etal., 1999):

$$
\Delta T _ { \mathrm { C } } = ( \Delta T - ( 1 - a ) \Delta T _ { \mathrm { ~ M ~ } } ^ { \prime } ) / a ,
$$

where $\Delta { T _ { \mathrm { C } } }$ and $\Delta T _ { \mathrm { ~ M ~ } } ^ { \prime }$ are the actual temperature differences between heated and unheated probes in the conductive sapwood and in the inactive xylem ${ \mathrm { ( } } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { \mathrm { ) } }$ ,respectively; $a$ is the length ratio of sap wood to probe; and $\Delta T _ { \mathrm { ~ M ~ } } ^ { \prime }$ is equal to $\Delta T _ { \mathrm { M } }$ in Equation 2.

As $F _ { \mathrm { d } }$ values are correlated with whole tree water consumption (Steppe et al., 2O1O), this value was used as an index to evaluate variations in transpiration. In addition， species specific calibration has been suggested (Du et al.， 2O11） and the underestimated value with thermal dissipation method should be considered when Granier-type probes data were used for whole tree water consumption calculation (Steppe et al., 2O1O). Therefore,the normalized $F _ { \mathrm { d } }$ $( S F _ { \mathrm { { n } } } )$ rather than whole-tree water consumption was used for diurnal and daily variation analyses as suggested by Du et al. (2011). The $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ was calculated by dividing all $F _ { \mathrm { d } }$ values for each replicate tree by the maximum during the observation period. Each replicate tree had a maximum $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ of 1,and the average normalized $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ was calculated among replicates within species.

# 2.4Investigation of root systems

In July 2015,3 individual trees of $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ .rhamnoides with approximately average trunk diameter and canopy radius (standard individual） were selected around each of 3 corresponding research plantations for whole plant root excavation. In pure plantation， the average canopy radius for standard individual of $P _ { \cdot }$ ，tabuliformis and $H _ { \ l }$ 、rhamnoides was 1.38 $( \pm 0 . 1 5 )$ and $0 . 9 2 \ ( \pm 0 . 0 9 ) \ \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ，respectively. In mixed plantation， the average canopy radius for standard individual of $P$ ，tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides was 1.19 $\left( \pm 0 . 0 8 \right)$ and 0. $9 ~ ( \pm 0 . 1 1 ) \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ respectively. Therefore， the corresponding radius of the majority of lateral roots was approximately 2.76 and $1 . 8 4 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ for $P _ { \ l }$ tabuliformis and $H .$ ，rhamnoides in pure plantations, respectively;and was approximately 2.38 and $1 . 8 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ for $P$ .tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides in mixed plantation,respectively. The $3 { \cdot } \mathrm { m }$ radius and $2 \mathrm { - m }$ depth for root excavations captured the majority of lateral and vertical roots for each selected standard individual. A spade was used to dig up the roots at $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ depth intervals,starting from the plant trunk to the edge of the plant canopy. Then, the fine roots (diameter ${ < } 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ） were manually selected,and their surface area was calculated for each $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ of the depth profile using WinRHIZO (Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada).

# 2.5Leaf water potential, stomatal conductance,and photosynthetic rate measurements

We examined leaf water potential, $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ ，and $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ in 16 of $2 5 ~ S F$ monitored individuals (4 individuals per species in each plantation) at midday (11:OO-14:00, LST) three times per month from June to September,2O15 (Table 1).Three well-expanded leaves were selected from each monitored individual. A LI-64OO analyzer (Li-Cor Inc.，USA） was used to measure $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ under approximately natural conditions (Du et al., 2O11). In addition, predawn leaf water potential ( $\langle \psi _ { \mathrm { p d } } ,$ （20 05:00-O6:OO) and midday leaf water potential $( \varPsi _ { \mathrm { m } } , 1 1 { : } 0 0 { - } 1 4 { : } 0 0 )$ were measured on nearby leaves on the same individual used for $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { { r } } }$ measurements with a PMS-1515D analyzer (PMS Instrument, Corvallis, OR, USA).

# 2.6 Threshold-delay model

The threshold-delay model suggests that there are upper and lower precipitation thresholds which stimulate plant water consumption (Ogle and Reynolds，2Oo4). This model incorporates the duration of rainfall pulse and the speed of plant response (Zeppel et al., 2008):

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \boldsymbol { y } _ { t } = k \boldsymbol { y } _ { t - 1 } + \boldsymbol { \delta } _ { t } , ~ } \\ { \boldsymbol { y } _ { t } = \operatorname* { m i n } \biggl [ \boldsymbol { y } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } \left( 1 - k \right) , ~ \boldsymbol { \delta } _ { t } ^ { * } ( 1 - \boldsymbol { y } _ { t - 1 } / \boldsymbol { y } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } ) \biggr ] , } \\ { \boldsymbol { \delta } _ { t } ^ { * } = \left\{ \begin{array} { l c r } { ( \delta _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } / ( R ^ { U } - R ^ { L } ) ) ( R _ { t - \tau } - R ^ { L } ) } & & { R ^ { L } < R _ { t - \tau } < R ^ { U } } \\ { 0 } & & { R _ { t - \tau } \leq R ^ { L } } \\ { \delta _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } } & & { R _ { t - \tau } \geq R ^ { U } } \end{array} \right. , } \end{array}
$$

where $y _ { t }$ is the $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ in this study; $y _ { t - 1 }$ is the antecedent $S F _ { \mathrm { n } } ; y _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ is the maximum response $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ $\delta _ { t } .$ （204号 $\boldsymbol { \delta } _ { t } ^ { * }$ ，and $\delta _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ are the potential, actual, and maximum potential response parameters, respectively; $R ^ { U }$ and $R ^ { L }$ are the upper and lower rainfall thresholds (mm), respectively; $R _ { t - \tau }$ is the effective rainfall amount (mm); $\tau$ is the time lag when the significant increases in $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ were observed after $R _ { t - \tau }$ (d); $k$ （20 is the reduction rate (d); and $t$ is the response time (d).

After testing for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance,we identified the rainfall threshold through one-way analysis of variance （ANOVA） and Tukey's HSD test. Then, the threshold-delay model was calculated by multiple linear regression (Ogle and Reynolds, 2004).

# 2.7 Statistical analysis

Relative response in daily $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ was calculated as $( X _ { \mathrm { m a x } } – X _ { \mathrm { b e f o r e } } ) / X _ { \mathrm { b e f o r e } } { \times } 1 0 0 \%$ ，where, $X _ { \mathrm { b e f o r e } }$ and $X _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ represent the $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ from the first day before a rainfall and the maximum $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ after rainfall, respectively. Significant relative changes in $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis in pure and mixed plantations, and $H .$ rhamnoides in pure and mixed plantations in response to rainfall were identified through ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test,after testing for a normal distribution and homogeneity of variance.Rainfall classes of O-5,5-1O and $> 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ were used for significant test,but a rainfall class of $1 0 { - } 1 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ was not used because only $1 1 \ \mathrm { m m }$ rainfall (DOY 222-226) was observed during the study period.

Significant differences in $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ ，leaf water potential, $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ between species in pure and mixed plantations were identified by independent samples $t$ -test,after testing for the normality and homogeneity of variances.Moreover, we also evaluated the effects of mixed afforestation on $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ ，leaf water potential, $g _ { \mathrm { s } } ,$ and $P _ { \mathrm { { r } } }$ through independent samples $t \cdot$ -test based on significant difference analyses of these variables for specific species in pure and mixed plantations.

In addition,the relationship between $\varPsi _ { \mathrm { p d } }$ and corresponding maximum $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ has been used to assess the effect of stomatal control on hydraulic characteristics(Thomas et al.， 2O08). The significant difference in the slope of a $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ and $\varPsi _ { \mathrm { p d } }$ linear regression can be tested through a General Linear Model (GLM) (Wei et al., 2O13). SPSS 18.O was used for all the statistical and regression analyses (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA),and the significant level was set at $P { < } 0 . 0 5$ （204号 level.

# 3 Results

# 3.1 Variation of environmental variables

There was $1 2 0 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ of rainfall during the observation period (DOY 156-269),which was the lowest value since 1988 and accounted for $3 3 . 8 \%$ of the mean annual precipitation amount between 1988 and 2O14 in the corresponding period. Although rainfal gradually increased during the later observation period (Fig.la),the daily average rainfall（1.1 $( \pm 2 . 4 ) \ \mathrm { m m / d } )$ represented only $8 . 4 \%$ of the corresponding ETp. This lack of suficient rainfall and high water demand may have resulted in drought stressfor these studied plantations,according to the monthly variation of Budyko's aridity index (Table 2).

The SWC at $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ depth showed the largest fluctuation with rainfall (Fig.1; Table 3),and the SWCs at depth 100 and $\overline { { 1 5 0 } } \ \mathrm { c m }$ gradually decreased during the observation period for the three plantations, which suggested that rainfall had less effect on SWC in deep soil. The highest daily averaged SWCswere observedat depth $5 0 \mathrm { c m }$ for pure $P .$ tabuliformisplantation, $1 0 0 \mathrm { c m }$ for pure H.rhamnoides plantation, and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ for mixed plantation. The lowest daily averaged SWCs also experienced the smallest coefficient of variation (CV） for each plantation,and could be observed at $1 5 0 \mathrm { c m }$ depth for pure $P .$ tabuliformis plantation, $2 0 \mathrm { c m }$ depth for pure $H .$ rhamnoides plantation, and $5 0 \mathrm { c m }$ depth for mixed plantation (Table 3).

# 3.2Daily and diurnal variations in $S F _ { \mathbf { n } }$ and responses to rainfall

The daily $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ ，rhamnoides in pure plantations generally exhibited a decreasing trend during the observation period; meanwhile,the daily $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ for both these two species in mixed plantation exhibited a "U" type, with the higher value occurring in June and September (Fig. 2). The variation of daily $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis in the plantation was significantly different ( $\scriptstyle ( t = 4 . 9 5$ ${ P \mathrm { { < } } } 0 . 0 1 \$ ， $d f = 2 2 6 )$ from that for the same species in mixed plantation. However, there was no significant difference ( $_ { t = 1 . 9 5 }$ ， $\scriptstyle P = 0 . 0 5 3$ ， $d f = 2 2 6$ ）in dailyvariation of $S F _ { n }$ for $H .$ ，rhamnoides in pure and mixed plantations.Generally, the relative response of $S F _ { n }$ for these two species significantly increased $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 , d f { = } 2 )$ among three rainfall classes in both pure and mixed plantations(Fig.3),when $1 0 { - } 1 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ class was not considered.However, no significant difference was observed either between rainfall classes of 5-1O and $> 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis in pure plantation $\scriptstyle ( P = 0 . 0 9$ ， $d f = 7$ )，or between rainfall classes of O-5 and $5 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m m }$ for $H .$ （20 rhamnoides in pure plantation $( P { = } 0 . 1 4 , d f { = } 7 )$ . Moreover, the CVs of $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ （204号 rhamnoides in pure plantation were $3 9 . 1 \%$ and $3 7 . 5 9 \%$ ，and were $4 3 . 6 4 \%$ and $3 6 . 5 8 \%$ for corresponding species in mixed plantation, respectively (Table 4).

Figures 4 showed the diurnal variation of $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ . The values of $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ （204号 rhamnoides in pure plantations increased from a minimum at midnight to a maximum at noon time,and exhibited a unimodal curve (Figs. 4a and c). In pure plantation, the half hourly average $S F _ { n }$ values for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ ，rhamnoides after rainfall increased from 0.27 $( \pm 0 . 2 6 )$ to $0 . 3 2 ( \pm 0 . 3 0 ) \$ and from 0.24 $( \pm 0 . 2 3 )$ to 0.35 $( \pm 0 . 3 3 )$ ，respectively. The $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis in mixed plantation followed a similar diurnal variation as that of $P .$ tabuliformis in pure plantation. However, $H _ { \ l }$ ，rhamnoides in mixed plantation showed a bimodal curve before rainfall and a unimodal curve after rainfall (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, the half hourly average $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ values for $P .$ （20 tabuliformisand $H _ { ☉ }$ ，rhamnoides in mixed plantation after rainfall increased from 0.23 $( \pm 0 . 2 4 )$ to

In pure and mixed plantations, $\psi _ { \mathrm { p d } }$ and $\psi _ { \mathrm { m } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ ，rhamnoides generally experienced a "U" type,with the higher values occurring in June and September (Fig. 5).

In pure and mixed plantations, $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides exhibited similar variation to that of leaf water potential, with the higher values occurring in June and September (Fig.6). The increased $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ was observed for $H .$ ，rhamnoides in pure and mixed plantations during DOY 171-174.In addition, the increased $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ was observed for $P .$ tabuliformis in pure and mixed plantations and for $H .$ ，rhamnoides in pure plantation during DOY 171-174. In pure plantation, both $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { { r } } }$ for $H .$ ，rhamnoides were significantly higher( $_ { t = 2 . 1 5 }$ ， $P { < } 0 . 0 5$ ， $d f = 2 2$ and $_ { t = 2 . 1 7 }$ ， $P { < } 0 . 0 5$ ， $d f = 2 2$ ，respectively） than the corresponding values for $P .$ tabuliformis.

# 4Discussion

# 4.1Sap flow characteristics and its response to rainfall in pure plantations

Similar to other studies in semi-arid regions (Swaffer et al.,2Ol4; Jian et al.,2O16),departure in $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ in response to rainfall pulse for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides indicated that sap flow in response to rainfall pulse underlying drought was species dependent. Previous studies indicated that coniferous species usually exhibited a strong self-regulation to maintain water consumption under drought conditions and were more sensitive to rainfall than broad-leaved species (Teklemariam et al., 2010; Zha et al.,2010; Wen et al.,2017). Moreover, the response of $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ to rainfall pulse also depends on both rainfall characteristics(Burgess，2Oo6) and other environmental conditions,such as drought extent (Reyes-Acosta and Lubczynski, 2O14).Large rainfall events may relieve drought conditions and small rainfall amounts may only wet the plant surface (Reynolds et al.,2OO4).Previous studies in shrubs (Jian et al.,2O15)and trees (Du et al., 2011）reported that $5 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ was the threshold rainfall amount to effectively influence water consumption in the Loess Plateau.However, 9.6 and $1 1 . 0 \mathrm { m m }$ were required as the lowest rainfall amounts to significantly increase $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides in pure plantations, respectively, which may be atributed to severe drought stress because the rainfall in 2O15 was the lowest since 1988 (Fig. 2). Zhao and Liu (2010) and Jian et al. (2016) also suggested that 13.0 mm was the upper-threshold of rainfall to affect plant water consumption in the Chinese Loess Plateau. However， 16.7 and $2 0 . 9 \ \mathrm { \ m m }$ were required as the upper rainfall amounts for $P .$ （204号 tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides,respectively, and may also attribute to the severe drought stress.

Moreover, Zencich et al. (2OO2) and Tang et al. (2O14) suggested that diverse root vertical distribution explained the different species responses to rainfall events. For example, shallow-rooted Hibbertia hypericoides responded rapidly to rainfal pulses; however, deep-rooted Banksia ilicifolia did not respond to rainfall even if it reached $1 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ (Zencich et al., 2002). In the studied pure plantations,more fine roots distributed in the upper soil layer of $P .$ tabuliformis could partially explain shorter time response $_ { ( \tau = 1 . 1 5 ) }$ to rainfall compared with $H .$ ，rhamnoides $\scriptstyle ( \tau = 1 . 7 6$ ; Fig. 7). The higher $R ^ { U }$ ，smaller $R ^ { L }$ and $\tau$ for $P .$ tabuliformis indicated that this species experienced high water demand and was more sensitive to rainfall pulses than the species $H .$ （204号 rhamnoides. These results were consistent with studies in the hilly region of the Chinese Loess Plateau by Wen et al. (2O17), which suggested that $P .$ tabuliformis was more sensitive to rainfall than $H .$ rhamnoides,by comparing the relative response of diurnal variation in transpiration before and after rainfall. Furthermore, the anatomical structure of xylem needs further analysis to well understand the water demand and rainfall pulse responses of each species (Xu and Li, 2006).

# 4.2Trade-off between stomatal control, leaf water potential, and photosynthesis in pure plantations

Previous studies suggested that the contrasting hydraulic traits among species under identical weather conditions probably resulted from both water uptake capacity (Xu and Li, 2OO6) and their optimized trade-off between carbon gain and water loss through photosynthesis (Sperry and Hacke,2002). $\varPsi _ { \mathrm { p d } }$ can be substituted for soil water potential in contact with the roots (Bucci et al., 2004).Although there was no significant difference between $\varPsi _ { \mathrm { p d } }$ for these two species, significantly $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ higher $\psi _ { m }$ was observed for $P .$ tabuliformis than for $H .$ rhamnoides. The results indicated that the former species maintained stable water status to avoid embolism damage and for protection of the water conducting system.

In the studied pure plantations,the observed decrease in maximum $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ with decreasing $\varPsi _ { \mathrm { p d } }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis was consistent with the hypothesis of Meinzer et al.(1999), who stated that high hydraulic constraints and water demand can lead to strong stomatal limitations to photosynthesis and transpiration. In contrast,no significant relationship between maximum $S F _ { \mathfrak { n } }$ and $\varPsi _ { \mathrm { p d } }$ was observed for $H .$ rhamnoides indicating that there was a weak stomatal limitation on transpiration and photosynthesis for this species.Xu et al. (2O11） suggested that high concentrations of Osmotically active substancesin $H .$ rhamnoides allowed wide osmotic adjustment and maintenance of stable leaf cell turgor pressure， and thus allowed stomatal opening and maintenance of photosynthesis.Moreover, similar to $P .$ deulis (West et al.,2007） and Virola michelii (Bonal and Guehl, 2001), $P .$ tabuliformis can be considered as an isohydric species and can thus adequately maintain $\psi _ { \mathrm { m } }$ through strong stomatal limitation,with the low $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { r } }$ during drought. However, $H .$ ，rhamnoides can be considered as an anisohydric species,maintaining $g _ { \mathrm { s } }$ and $P _ { \mathrm { { r } } }$ at low $\psi _ { \mathrm { m } }$ expense. Similar physiological adjustments were observed in Juniperus osteosperma (West et al., 2007) and $E$ ：grandis (Zhu et al.,2015).

# 4.3Mixed afforestation effects on $P .$ tabuliformisandH.rhamnoides

Facilitative interactions in relation to water resources can lead to stable co-existence,however, competition for water resources may induce exclusion of species (Xu and Li, 2O06). Co-existing species in natural forest usually exhibit different physiological or morphological adjustments to minimize competition for water during prolonged drought periods (Trubat et al., 2OO6; Yang et al., 2015).This facilitative interaction has also been observed among species in plantations even in seasonal drought or semi-arid water limited regions (Wu et al.,2O17; Zhang et al.,2017).For example, Zhang et al. (2O17) suggested the dense canopy cover of $P .$ tabuliformis can reduce the evaporation of soil water in surface layers,which may benefit co-existing species, such as Platycladus orientalis,in the dryland Loess Plateau of China.However, in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China in the present study， although contrasting physiological adjustments of $P .$ （20 tabuliformis and $H .$ ，rhamnoides were observed in mixed plantations (Figs.5 and 6)，mixed afforestation significantly altered $S F _ { \mathrm { n } }$ characteristics and rainfall pulse sensitivityin $P .$ tabuliformis. Mixed afforestation reduced $3 2 . 3 \%$ and $2 5 . 2 \%$ of $R ^ { L }$ and $\tau$ for $P .$ tabuliformis, respectively. However, the effect of mixed plantation only reduced the corresponding values of $R ^ { L }$ and $\tau$ to $1 9 . 1 \%$ and $8 . 5 \%$ for $H .$ rhamnoides (Table 5).In addition,mixed plantation increased $2 6 . 3 \%$ and $1 3 . 2 \%$ of $R ^ { U }$ for $P .$ tabuliformis and $H .$ rhamnoides, respectively. Previous studies also indicated that, compared with isohydric species,anisohydric species such as Acer saccharum and $E .$ gomphocephala may be more suitable to drought-prone habitats (Franks et al., 2OO7; West et al.,2007). However, under prolonged drought and less precipitation water input,anisohydric species may experience xylem embolism even mortality( $\mathrm { \Delta X u }$ and Li,2006),and isohydric species may suffer from carbon starvation (McDowell et al.,2O08). The threshold value of leaf water potential causing $100 \%$ stem cavitation for $P .$ tabuliformis and carbon gain to avoid carbon starvation for $H .$ rhamnoides needs further investigation to assess the drought adaptive capacity of these two species.

Competition among co-occurring species may be apparent through root morphology characteristics such as architecture of fine root systems (Sperry and Hacke,2OO2; Xu et al., 2007). Although accurate water source was not analyzed using stable isotopes in the present study, the overlap in root distribution of co-occurring species may result in water competition (Schwinning and Ehleringer, 2OO1). In response to prolonged drought in desert regions, $H .$ rhamnoides also exhibited root morphology plasticity (Xu et al.， 2OO7). In the studied mixed plantation, $H .$ （20 rhamnoides developed more shallow roots and a similar root distribution to $P .$ tabuliformis especially in the upper $4 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ of soil (Fig. 7). West et al. (2007) suggested that shallow roots may maximize extraction of water before it is lost to evaporation and maximize the uptake of nutrients, as nutrient concentrations are highest near the soil surface. Indeed, the total nitrogen $( 0 . 5 3 \% )$ and phosphorus $( 0 . 0 4 \% )$ contents at $\textstyle 0 - 4 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ soil depth were 2.20 and 1.97 times more than that at $4 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 \ { \mathrm { c m } }$ soil depth. Thus, $H .$ rhamnoides and $P .$ tabuliformis in mixed plantation may have competed for limited water and nutrient reserves. Therefore,competition for both water and nutrients should be further investigated to adequately evaluate mixed afforestation of these species.

# 5 Conclusions

This study demonstrated that $H .$ rhamnoides and $P .$ tabuliformis adopted contrasting strategies to cope with drought in 2015.Compared with $H _ { \ l }$ ，rhamnoides, $P .$ tabuliformis was more sensitive to rainfall pulse in pure plantation. $P .$ tabuliformis displayed isohydric behavior through strong stomatal limitation，and $H .$ rhamnoides displayed anisohydric behavior. Mixed afforestation enhanced more rainfall pulse sensitivity and water demand for $P .$ tabuliformis.However,mixed afforestation did not significantly affect the rainfall pulse sensitivity of $H .$ rhamnoides at the expense of decreased leaf water potential status. Therefore,the mixed afforestation of these two species should be further considered for "Grain-for-Green" projects in this region.
