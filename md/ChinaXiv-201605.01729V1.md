# Introduction

Bladder cancer (BC),a kind of malignant tumor developed on bladder mucosa,is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide [1].In regard to neoplasia of the genitourinary tract,itis the second most common tumor [2].There are a varietyof bladdercanceraccordingtodifferent pathological types,suchas urothelial cell carcinoma,squamous cell carcinomaofbladderand bladderadenocarcinoma.Among these forms of cancer in the bladder,urothelial cell carcino ma (UcC) is the most common one,and can be divided into two groups,namely, low grade and high grade [3,4].The low-grade UCC are nonmuscle invasive and always papillary,whereas the high-grade UcC are often invasive and can be either papillary or non-papillary [5].The former UcC can be managed by endoscopic resectionwithintra-vesicalchemotherapy[6]. However, the treatment outcome of the latter, that the mortality is around $50 \%$ despite radical therapy[7]，isdisappointing.Consequently, diagnosis of bladder cancer ina low grade can ameliorate the therapy outcomes and is crucial to reduce the mortality rate.

Currently, the standard diagnostic methods to detect BC are cystoscopy and urinary cytology. Although its high sensitivity，cystoscopy is an invasive and relatively expensive procedure [8]. What's more,it's may lead to some discomfort oreven some complications,for instance,urinary tract infection.On the other hand,urinary cytologyis non-invasiveand has a high specificity $( 9 0 \% - 9 5 \% )$ ，butit lacks sensitivity( $3 0 \%$

UrinarymicroRNAs forbladdercancer diagnosis

$40 \%$ [9].Meanwhile,both of the two methods showan unsatisfactory accuracy in low-grade tumorsdetection[1O,11].Therefore,thereare ongoing efforts to grope for non-invasive and effective approaches to identify incipient symptoms,and many new urine-based tests have beenresearched.Quantitiesofbiomarkersin urine，such as bladder tumor antigen (BTA), urine fibrin fibrinogen degradation products (FDP)，nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22), ImmunoCyt and FISH (Uro Vysion),have been found to be of diagnostic value [12,13].In comparison to urinary cytology,those urinary biomarkers have higher sensitivities $( 5 0 \% - 7 0 \% )$ （204号 andrelatively lower specificities $( 6 0 \% 8 0 \% )$ [12,13]. Despite the fact that those urinary biomarkers can't replace cystoscopy or urinary cytology so far due to their insufficient sensitivity or specificity [14,15],urine-based diagnostic tools proved to be promising for BC detection with the advantages that urine-based tests arenon-invasive， convenient and canbe repeated [1O].Besides,physicochemical characters and molecular changes of urine can distinctly reflect the pathophysiological condition of BC as it is the second most common malignancy that involves the urinary system [2]. Thus,more studies are really needed to focus on identification of novel and reliable urinary biomarkers for detecting BC.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs,which are involved in various biological processesandactas regulators of gene expression either by messenger RNA degradation or by translation repression [16]. Recently,cumulative evidence hasdemonstratedthatmiRNAs play important roles in embryonic development of different cancers [17-21].For instance,the researches that Calin etal.havedone，which characterized the 13q14 deletion in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia，have provided theevidenceof implicationof2miRNAs (miR15a and miR-16-1) in human cancer [22]. Hence，miRNAs may have potential clinical applicability, for example,servingas biomarkers for cancer diagnosis.In addition,miRNAs have excellent stability in urine against RNase degradation，extremetemperature and pH, multiple freeze-thaw cycle,which facilitate the relevant tests and make miRNAs a promising biomarkerin BCdetectionaswell.

Specifically,there have been numerous analyses of expression of many miRNAs in urine samplesofBCpatients [6,23-26],and different expression signatures have been observed between normal urothelium and UcC [27,28]. Notably，lots of studies have demonstrated high expression levels of miR-96 and miR-183 in urine from BC patients [24,29,30]. Among them,the analysis Hideki et al. have revealed that the sensitivityand specificity of miR-96 for UCC detection were $7 0 . 4 \%$ and $9 0 . 5 \%$ ，while the corresponding data were $9 4 . 3 \%$ and $9 2 . 9 \%$ as for miR-183 [24]. Enokida et al.also found that the sensitivity of the two miRNAs to distinguish BC from non-BC patients were $7 1 . 0 \%$ (miR-96) and $7 4 . 0 \%$ (miR-183),while the specificity were $8 9 . 2 \%$ (miR-96) and $7 7 . 3 \%$ (miR183)，respectively [3O]. Furthermore，Miah et al.have studied another 3 miRNAs (miR-1224- 3p，-135b and -15b)and obtained different results.This study showed that the sensitivity of each individual miRNA ranged from $6 7 . 8 \%$ to $8 5 . 7 \%$ ，and the combination of miR-1224-3p/ -135b/-15b show a higher sensitivity of $9 4 . 1 \%$ for BC diagnosis [6]. Moreover,miR-126 [23, 31] and miR-200a [26] also appear to be detectable in urine and useful in the diagnosis ofbladder cancer. Obviously,these outcomes were inconsistent on the diagnostic accuracy. Additionally， individual study may also limited by small sample size,few kinds of miRNA profiling,etc.Accordingly,a systematic review,which focuses on the overall clinical applicability of miRNAs in BC detection,can provide a more precise result.Therefore，we conducteda meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of miRNAs in BC detection.

# Methods

# Search strategy

A comprehensive literature search prior to Feb. 7，2015 was conducted.Sources of studies included PubMed，Embase，Web of Science, theCochraneLibrary， ChineseNational Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKl)，and so on. The searchingterms“microRNAs,miRNA,miRs; urinarybladderneoplasms，bladder cancer, urothelial cancer,BC,UCC;sensitivity,specificity，diagnosis，ROC curve”were adopted.We also lookupthe reference lists of theselected articlesto identifyany additionaleligible studies.

# Inclusionandexclusioncriteria

Studieswereincludediftheysatisfiedthe fol lowing criteria: (1) studies related to the diag

UrinarymicroRNAsforbladdercancerdiagnosis nostic value of miRNAs for bladder cancer; (2) the diagnosis of BC based on cystoscopy,which wasconsidered asthestandardmethods for BC diagnosis;(3) studies which measured the expression of miRNAs in urine;(4) both the sensitivity and specificity data were provided or could be calculated.

Correspondingly,studies were excluded based on the criteria below:(1) studies that were abstracts,letters,talksorreviews;(2)studies with duplicate data reported in other studies or without complete data to enable to construct two-by-two tables;(3) studies that focused on miRNAs in tissue or blood.

Data extraction

Two investigators carefully reviewed the full text ofthe included studies to search for the relevant data.Theextracted dataelements ofeach study included:studydetails (firstauthor,year of publicationand countryof publication),characteristics of study population (ethnicity,number,age and gender ratio of patients and controls; source of control) and data for diagnostic meta-analysis (specimen，detecting method, miRNAsprofiledandmiRNAsexpression change,sensitivityand specificity data).

Qualityassessment

The qualities of included studies were scored by two reviewers independently，using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2(QUADAS-2) criteria[32].The QUADAS-2 tool contained seven questions, each of which should be answered with“yes"(1 score),“unclear"or“no"(O score).All questions were given equal weight,resulting in a maximum possible score of 7.Any conflictingevaluation was resolved after fully discussion.

Statisticalmethods

All statistical analyses were performed using R software.The sensitivity and specificity data of miRNAs associated with the diagnostic value of BC were extracted from each study to evaluate the diagnostic value of urinary miRNAs. Firstly, we calculated the pooled results of sensitivity, specificity， positive and negative likelihood ratio (PLR and NLR，respectively)，diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (Cls) by using the random-effect model. Simultaneously, the summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve was generated and the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was calculated.These parametersabove enabled our estimate of the overall diagnostic accuracy.Among them，PLR represents the odds of positive test results in BC patients, while NLR reflects the odds of positive results inthosewithout BC.Relatively,DOR is the combination of PLR and NLR(DOR $\mathbf { \Sigma } = \mathbf { \Sigma }$ PLR/NLLR). The higher DOR value isthe better discriminatory test performance will be [33]. On the other hand, the SROC curve is widely accepted as a graphical technique to assess the ability of a test to discriminate between those with disease and those without disease [34，35]. Besides，the heterogeneity between studies was evaluated through Chi-square test and $I ^ { 2 }$ test. If the tests show a $P < 0 . 1$ or $I ^ { 2 } > 5 0 \%$ ，the existence of significant heterogeneity will be verified [36，37]. Then meta-regression and subgroupanalyseswereundertakentoexplore the sources of between-study heterogeneity. Furthermore,Deeks'funnel plots were adopted to evaluate the publication bias.

# Results

Includedstudies

A total of 71 relevant studies were initially identified.Afterwards 2 additional studies were found through other sources,and there were no duplicates among these records.The titles, abstracts and key words of the 73 studies were looked up.Then,55unqualified studiesincludingletters，reviews,editorials，casereports, irrelevantresearcheswereexcluded.Asto the rest of 2O literatures,their full-text versions were carefully examined and retrieved.Asa result,6 of them didn't use urine samples: 4 were based on tissue samples[5,38-4O],and 2 were blood samples [8,41]. According to the exclusioncriteria,thesestudieswereexcluded from furtheranalysis. Uitimately,14 high-quality cohort studies were included for this systematic review and meta-analysis [8,1O,23,25, 26,29-31, 42-47].

Due to the existence of significant heterogeneitybetweenstudies insensitivityandspecificity $( I ^ { 2 } \ = \ 8 1 . 2 6 \%$ and $I ^ { 2 } = 8 4 . 4 2 \%$ ，the random effect model was adopted.The pooled results of diagnostic criteria and their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervalswerelistedinTable2.Theoverallsensitivity, specificity, PLR,NLR and DOR were O.71

Moreover, we generated the SROC curve and calculated the area under the curve (AUC),which was O.79 $9 5 \%$ Cl: 0.75-0.82) (Figure 1). Altogether, the overall diagnostic accuracy of urinarymiRNAs for BC detection was moderately high.

# Meta-regressionandsubgroupanalysis

In order to explore the heterogeneity between studies，we conducted subgroup analyses, whichwerebasedonethnicity(Asianor Caucasian) and miRNA profiling (single or multiple).The SROC curves for each group were shown in Figure 2 and the corresponding diagnostic parameters were listed in Table 2.It turned out that both the sensitivity and specificity of miRNA panels (sensitivity:O.83,specificity: O.81)were higher than single miRNA (sensitivity:O.69,specificity:O.74)，which indicated that the diagnostic accuracy of miRNA panels was superior to that of single miRNA. Figure 3 presented the forest plots of data from the miRNA panels-based studies and mean sensitivityand specificity.

Figure 4.Linear regression test of Deeks'funnel plot asymmetry of overall studies.

With regard to another subgroup,the results implied that specificity might come at the cost of sensitivity.To be more specific, the studies based on Caucasian population had a pooled specificity of O.74 and a sensitivity of 0.69, while studies based on Asian had a relatively higherspecificity (O.75)with a little bit lower sensitivity (O.75). All in all, the foregoing results of subgroup analyses suggested that the ethnicity and miRNA profiling had an evident influence on the diagnostic accuracy.Therefore, these factors might be the potential sources of heterogeneity.

To further confirm the results of subgroup analyses,we also conducted the meta-regression. The correlative results indicated that miRNA profiling had a significant influence on both sensitivity and specificity $( P ~ < ~ 0 . 0 5 )$ .In consequence,further evidence was provided for the subgroup analysisabove.

# Publicationbias

Finally, the Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test was conducted to evaluate the publication bias.Andeitherof themhada $P$ value of 0.18 for the slope coefficient, indicating the symmetryinthe dataand the lowlikelihood of publication bias (Figure 4).

# Discussion

Asmentionedabove,bladdercanceristhe fifth most common malignancy worldwide [1],and earlydetection is important to improve survival of BC patients. Nowadays,cystoscopy and urinary cytology，which are the current standard diagnostic methods to detect BC，lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy of low-grade BC[10, 11].Thus,novel and reliable biomarkers for BC detection are urgently needed. Notably，present studies have indicated potential diagnostic value of urinary miRNAs for BC[23,25,26,42, 43]．However，therewereinconsistencies between studies，not only on the diagnostic accuracy,but also on the kinds of urinary miRNAs that were profiled.For example,miR-96 yieldedasensitivityof $7 0 . 4 \%$ anda specificity of $9 0 . 5 \%$ in the study that Hidiki et al. made [29],and a sensitivity of $7 1 . 0 \%$ and a specificity of $8 9 . 2 \%$ in Yamada et al.' study [42]. Similarly, there were differences of diagnostic accuracy of miR-200a for BC detection between Wang et al.'study and Yun et al.'study [26,44]. Except for single miRNA，miRNA panels were also investigated in other studies [23,31,43,45]. What's more,the combination of miR-125b and miR-126 showed a very high diagnostic accuracy to detect BC patients,with a sensitivity of $100 \%$ and a specificity of $100 \%$ [31].On the other hand,Mengual et al. developed a panel of six miRNAs (miR-187, ${ \mathsf { - 1 8 a ^ { \star } } }$ ,-25,-142-3p,-140- 5p,-2O4) to discriminate UcC from normal individuals,and the results showed a specificity of $8 4 . 8 \%$ and a sensitivity of $8 6 . 5 \%$ [45]. In consideration of different basic characteristics of patients and controls and different selected miRNAs,the above disaccord is accessible.As far as we know,no previous meta-analysis on the overall accuracy of urinary miRNAs in BC diagnosis has been performed.Hence,we performed this meta-analysis to access the overall diagnostic value of urinary miRNAs for BC diagnosis.

Asaresult,the overall sensitivity and specificity ofurinary miRNAs to detect BC were O.71and 0.75,respectively.The relatively highsensitivity and specificity revealed a high level of accuracy of urinary miRNAs to detect BC.Meanwhile, the pooled PLR was 2.8 and the pooled NLR was 0.39,whichalsoverifiedthe conclusionabove. Furthermore,our meta-analysis presented that the AUC,whichwas anoverall indicator of test performance，was O.79.In addition，the fact that the DOR value was 7 indicated a good discriminatorytestperformance.Takentogether, these outcomes suggested that urinary miRNAs had a relatively high diagnostic accuracy.

# UrinarymicroRNAs forbladdercancer diagnosis

While heterogeneity between studies may affect the results of the meta-analysis，subgroup analyses will help us to explore these influences.Therefore，subgroupanalyses, which were based on ethnicity and miRNA profiling，were conducted in our meta-analysis. And it's notable that the diagnostic accuracy of miRNA combination was obviously higher than that of single miRNA.Besides,a meta-regression analysis was performed to confirm the results of subgroup analyses.Through subgroup analysesand meta-regression,we found that miRNA profiling had a significant influence on both sensitivity and specificity.Apart from the analysesmentioned above，there were other potential sources of heterogeneity, such as the difference of the cut-off value applied amongthestudies.Therefore,furtherresearchesareneeded to explore heterogeneityand attendantinfluences.

There are several advantages of the present meta-analysis.First of all,several methods were conducted to reduce the influence of heterogeneity. In addition，we used comprehensivemethods，includingrigorousliterature screening process,to try to avoid publication bias.Moreover,high stability of urinarymiRNA wasrepeatedly reported，which makesour analysis more reliableand repeatable.However, thereare stillseveral limitations inourmetaanalysis.Firstly， the included studies were based on limited sample size,and there were inconsistence among the included studies. Secondly，few studies were conductedon African populations,and some other language publications (like Japanese and German) may not be included in this study，which may increase the bias of the meta-analysis.Thirdly, most included studies didn't differentiate the grade of bladder cancer，and were short of investigation on the diagnostic value of urinary miRNAs for low-grade BC.

According to the results of the meta-analysis, wecan reach the conclusion that urinary miRNAs presenta promising noninvasive approach for BC diagnosis.Although the overall diagnostic accuracy was far from ideal,subgroup analysis indicated that miRNA panels had great potential as new diagnostic biomarkers in BC. Nevertheless,there is stilla long way to go for their practical usage in BC diagnosis.And large clinical studies are needed to confirm their diagnostic value.What's more,moreattention should be paid to the diagnostic accuracy of urinarymiRNAs for low-grade BC.
