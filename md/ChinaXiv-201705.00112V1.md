Hexagonal Columnar $\mathbf { Z } \mathbf { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ powders were obtained from irregular commercial powder at low temperature using microwave heating technique.It was confirmed that the raw $\mathbf { Z } \mathbf { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ powders first underwent dissolution process in the glassy coating,followed by re-crystallization.A growth mechanism involving selective attachment is proposed to explain the formation of the hexagonal tubules.

# I．Introduction

Zteopuudiboridroami / temperature environments due to their high melting $( Z \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 } )$ taer "higd inehihg point and their outstanding electrical and thermal conductivities.These ceramics also possess an excellent corrosion resistanceas well asa high thermal shock resistance.1-3 $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ceramics are generally polycrystalline after sintering at high temperature (above $2 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ）with equiaxed orrandomly oriented grains.However,some anisotropic properties such as strength,hardness,fracture toughness,and oxidation resistance have been observed for textured $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ based ceramics.4.5 Therefore,the performance of $\mathrm { Z r B } _ { 2 }$ ceramics should be enhanced by controlling the development of the grain microstructure.Messing et al.have comprehensively studied the synthesis and characterization of textured alumina ceramics, and pointed out that improved structural and electronic properties could be achieved when polycrystalline ceramics exhibit some anisotropic characteristics typical of single crystals.6For instance, textured polycrystalline alumina fabricated via templated grain growth(TGG) had a strength and fracture toughness increased of about $62 \%$ and $48 \%$ respectively，_in comparison to their counterparts with coarser grains.Besides,Wang et al.also observed that the alumina ceramics with a textured microstructure can achieve a high transparency $70 . 3 \%$ at $6 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ).8

In the previous investigations, two main approaches were employed to achieve the textured ceramics.The first one is the alignment of each ceramic green powder in suspension under a very strong magnetic field before sintering.The difference in magnetic torsion along different crystal axes of anisotropic crystals is responsible for the direction-selected alignment in this method.The second approach is the TGG method in which platelike ceramic powders were mixed with precursors and sintering aids to form slurry for subsequent tape casting.The sintering of the previously tape-cast green samples induces anisotropic grain growth.One or twodimensional ceramic seeds are the necessary prerequisites in this technique. To apply TGG method to produce textured $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ceramics，morphology-controlled synthesis of single crystal seeds is required.

In this communication,the microwave heating method was employed to promote the formation of columnar $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ crystal in a glassy mixture of $\mathrm { Z r O } _ { 2 }$ ， ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ and C.Nucleation and growth of uniform columnar crystals of $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ were carefully studied.It is believed that the dissolution-recrystallizationgrowth mechanism is linked to this preferential morphology transformation of $\mathrm { Z r B } _ { 2 }$ crystals.

# I．Experimental Procedure

Zirconiumoxychlorideoctahydrate $( Z \mathrm { r O C l } _ { 2 } { \cdot } 8 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ ， $98 \%$ ） andboricacid $\mathrm { ( H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { B O } _ { 3 }$ ，GR),were used as the sources of $Z \mathrm { r }$ andB,respectively.Chitosan(deacetylation $2 9 5 \%$ ，Viscosity $1 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m P a { \cdot } s }$ ） was used as a polymerizable monomer and ascarbon source.Glutaraldehyde (GR, $50 \%$ in $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { \it \cdot } ^ { \cdot }$ was used as a crosslinking agent.Commercial $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ powders with irregular morphology were used as seeds with average particle size ranging from 3 to $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ：

The detailed process of synthesis of columnar $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ powders is described below.Typically, $1 \mathrm { \ W t \% }$ of chitosan in aceticacidsolutionwasprepared.Then， $\mathrm { H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { B O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { Z r O C l } _ { 2 } { \cdot } 8 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ were added into the chitosan solution to form a transparent Zr-B-C-O precursor solution.The amounts of chitosan, $\mathrm { Z r O C l } _ { 2 } { \cdot } 8 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ ，and $\mathrm { H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { B O } _ { 3 }$ were determined according to the molar ratio of $\mathbf { C } / \mathbf { Z r } / \mathbf { B } = 1 0 / 5 . 2 / 1$ . Raw $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles were then put into the Zr-B-C-O precursor solution and stably suspended due to the high viscosity of chitosan polymer.Glutaraldehyde was added to the suspension and kept at a temperature of $6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ for polymerization until a stable gel formed.The obtained gel was freeze-dried,and the resultant mixture powder was pyrolyzed at a rate of $8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } /$ min to $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ inatube furnace under a flow of nitrogen gas to allow the transformation of the Zr-B-C-O precursor into $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { O } } _ { 2 }$ ， ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ,and amorphous carbon.

High-temperature boro/carbothermal reduction reaction wascarried out in a high-vacuum microwave furnace (HAMiLab-HV3，SYNOTHERM co.，Changsha,China）at target temperatures ranging from $1 2 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in Ar atmosphere.The heating rate was $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C / m i n }$ below $1 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and then $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C / m i n }$ up to the target temperature.

The phase composition of the products was identified by powder $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ -ray diffraction (XRD;Bruker AXS D8 Discover, Karlsruhe,Germany)with $\mathrm { C u } K _ { \alpha }$ radiation and Si asan internal standard.The morphology of the products was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM；Hitachi S-4800, Tokyo,Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy(EDS) system.Transmissionelectronmicroscopy (TEM；Tecnai F2o,Phillip,Eindhoven，Holland）wasalso used to determine the phase composition.

# III.Results and Discussion

The morphology of raw $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles and microwave-synthesized products at various temperatures are shownin Fig.1.The commercial $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ powder particles [Fig.l(a)] are irregularly shaped with some $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ or ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ impurities on their surfaces.After microwave heating at $1 2 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，aglassy coating and worm-like particles were formed on the surfaces of raw $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles [Fig.1(b)].High-resolution TEM image shows that these oxide particles are in an amorphous state (not shown). At $1 2 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，the amount of these coatings was reduced while the raw $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles were totally transformed into agglomerates of small grains [Fig.1(c)]. At $1 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，some dots and rods are visible on these small grains [Fig. 1(d)]. At $1 3 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，these rods became predominant and preferentially grew together into clusters [Fig.1(e)]. Finally, all small grains were transformed into hollow and columnar whiskers at $1 3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [Fig.1(e)]. The average length of these whiskers is about $1 2 \ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ,and the aspect ratio is about six.It isnoteworthy thatnearlyall raw $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ powder particles have disappeared in the final product.This fact is related to the efficiency of the microwave heating method to promote the dissolution and recrystallization of $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ materials.

Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of products synthesized by microwave heating method at different temperatures.At low temperatures such as $1 2 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 2 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [Figs. 2(a) and (b)], $ { \mathrm { Z r O } } _ { 2 }$ and $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ phases are identified.The presence of $\mathbf { \mathrm { ~ \ Z r B } } _ { 2 }$ phase is attributed to the raw material.A broad peak at $2 7 ^ { \circ }$ is related to the existence of carbon from the decomposition of chitosan.The glassy phase of ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ is not detected owing to its amorphous state.However，EDS analysis on the worm-like particles [Fig.1(b)] indicates that their main composition is $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ ， ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ,andC.Seemingly,the $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ precursors have completely reacted and been transformed into $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ phase at temperature as low as $1 3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [Figs. 2(c) and (d)].

The morphology evolution of $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles from the irregular to the columnar shape,is remarkable since the shape-controlled synthesis of such covalently bonded materials has been seldom reported.Recently,Zhang et al.found that rod-like $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles can be synthesized using carbon black as carbon source.9 The intermediate product of ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ was regarded as a crucial factor that promotes the anisotropic growth. The molten ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ is also expected to play a crucial role for the further boro/carbothermal reduction since the reaction temperature in present work was close to that reported by Zhang $( 1 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ .Indeed,the glassy coating is easilyobserved in the products synthesized at low temperature [Fig.1(b)]. The molten ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ phase might lower the nucleation temperature of $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ leading to the synthesis of submicron-sized or nano-sized particles.1° However, there is an unexpected reordering or an oriented growth of $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ crystals by microwave heating technique at high temperature [Fig.1(f)]. This fact means that the molten ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ phase might have acted as a“reaction pool” favoring the atomic diffusion during crystal growth.

In the present work,the well-crystallized columnar $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ products can be attributed to the following factors.First, the uniform distribution of atomic elements in the $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ ceramic precursor through the gel formation technique has considerably shortened the atomic diffusion distance,thus lowed the reaction barrier.After microwave heating， the as-formed $\mathrm { Z r O } _ { 2 }$ ， ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { ~ \varsigma ~ } _ { \mathrm { ~ \ / ~ C ~ } }$ may have transformed into an amorphous solid solution that wrap the raw $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles [Fig.1(b)].High-resolution TEM observations and selectedarea electron-diffraction results (not shown) of a ceramic precursor particle have confirmed the amorphous nature of the coating. The raw irregular $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles might have been dissolved into the amorphous solid solution since the original particles as well as the coatings gradually transformed into small particles at temperature above $1 2 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [Figs.1(c) and (d)].Besides,the high-energy conversion efficiency of microwave heating method may have contributed to the resulting columnar $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles.Indeed,contrary to the traditional heating approaches (such as thermal conduction,thermal convection,and thermal radiation),microwave heating takes advantage of the electromagnetic absorption capability of target materials and allows a volumetric heatingin the whole materials. $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ is a kind of conductive material,and can effectively absorb the microwave power through conductive loss mechanism.Meanwhile,the glassy solid solution coating of $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ is transparent to the microwave and insulated to heat transfer.Therefore,a sharp temperature gradient might have been built up near the interface of raw $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles and coatings.The latter may have provided a driving force for the observed dissolution of $\mathrm { Z r B } _ { 2 }$ seeds into solid solution.When the concentrations of $Z \mathrm { r }$ and B are over-saturated,the $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ phase will nucleate and recrystallize from the solid solution [Figs.1(d) and (e)]. Itis believed that the poor microwave absorption and the low thermal conductivity of the glassy coating of $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ may have resulted in a moderate evaporation of ${ \bf B } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ .This may have provided a substantial growth environment for the columnar particles of $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ：

It is interesting to note that during the recrystallization of $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ，single rod-like crystals emerged at the initial stage [Fig.l(d)],then a cluster of rod-like crystals grew out in a mode of side by side [Fig.1(e)].When the recrystallization process was performed at $1 3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for only $5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ，short hollow-columnar crystals were formed [Fig.3(a)].Their diameter was around $0 . 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ with an aspect ratio of about 1.5. After a longer treating time ( $^ { \mathrm { ~ \textit ~ { ~ 1 ~ h ~ } ~ } }$ at $1 3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the diameter of $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ became larger (about $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ）and the aspect ratio of the column crystals was increased to about six [Figs.l(f) and 3(b)].For the columnar crystal growth habit,it is believed that the prismatic crystal plans should possess lower surface energies than the polar surfaces ones( $\mathrm { Z r }$ -terminated or B-terminated). The total surface energy of the materials system should be at the lowest level if most of hexagonal prismatic plans of $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ with the $P 6 _ { \prime }$ /mmm structure are exposed.The glassy solid solution of $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ may have provided a suitable environment favoring the atomic diffusion and crystal growth.The hollow tube morphology of $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ can be well observed in Fig.3(c).This is distinguishable from rod-like morphology reported by previous work.It can be assumed that the selective attachment growth mechanism played the key role during the formation of tubular rod morphology. 11 Actually,in the initial growth stage the tinyrods were assembled into clusters in which they shared the prismatic plans [Fig.l(e)]. This growth habit became more pervasive in the ripened columnar crystals [Fig.3(b)].A careful investigation of the morphology evolution from the nucleation step to the intermediate step then to the final step revealed that $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ grain growth began in the rim of the raw particles and left the holes inside of assembled rods at the final stage (Figs.1 and 3).The diameter of final columnar crystals was almost same as that of raw particles,which corroborates the proposed tubular crystal formation mechanism by selective attachment.The ragged surface inside the whiskers may be due to the scarce feeding or difficult access of the atoms ( $\mathrm { \Delta } Z \mathrm { r }$ andB) in thisarea[Fig.3(c)].Few columnar crystals deviate from the strictly hexagonal shape [Fig.3(d)], but the angles values of inside walls are close to $1 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ .This fact means that the formation mechanism still follows the selective attachment of pristine rods along their prismatic planes.As soon as the $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ grains nucleate and grow on the surface of $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ precursor ceramic particles,they should also be self-heated in the microwave field,which further enhance the growth kinetics of columnar crystals.

The scale bars in (a),(c),and (d) are $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$

The as-described columnar $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ whiskers and the underlying growth mechanism may have implication for the fabrication of textured $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ceramics as well aswhisker reinforced composites.For example，the as-synthesized $\mathbf { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ whiskers can be added as seeds to the $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ ceramic precursor as the feeding source in slurry during tape casting.The long whiskers should be laid with the polar plane perpendicular to the tape surface.Thus, the TGG mechanism proposed by Messing may be applicable in the $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ material system.

# IV.Conclusions

In summary, the irregular shape of commercial $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles was effectively transformed into hexagonal columnar shape through a microwave heating approach.A low synthesis temperature was achieved by taking advantage of the selfheating featureof $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ material under the microwave electromagnetic field.A $Z \mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ ceramic precursor has provided a suitable environment for the nucleation and recrystallization of $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { r } \mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles.A selective attachment growth mechanism was proposed to explain the tubular morphology of products.
