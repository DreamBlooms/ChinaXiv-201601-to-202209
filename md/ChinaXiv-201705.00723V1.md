To enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse effects, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescribe a combination of plant species/minerals,called formulae,based on clinical experience.Nearly 1oo,ooo formulae have been recorded,but the working mechanisms of most remain unknown. In trying to address the possible beneficial effects of formulae with current biomedical approaches,we use Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF),which has been proven to be very effective in treating human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) as a model. The main componentsofRlFarerealgar,Indigonaturalis,andSalviamiltiorrhiza, with tetraarsenic tetrasulfide (A),indirubin (l),and tanshinone lA (T) asmajor active ingredients,respectively. Here,we report that the ATl combination yields synergy in the treatment of a murine APLmodel in vivo and in the induction of APL cell differentiation in vitro.ATl causes intensified ubiquitination/degradation of pro myelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor $\mathbf { \alpha } _ { \mathbf { { \alpha } } } ( \mathbf { \alpha } _ { \mathbf { { \alpha } } } )$ (RARα) oncoprotein,stronger reprogramming of myeloid differentiation regulators,and enhanced $\mathsf { \pmb { G } } _ { 1 } / \mathsf { \pmb { G } } _ { 0 }$ arrest in APL cells through hitting multiple targets compared with the effects of mono-or biagents. Furthermore,ATl intensifies the expression of Aquaglyceroporin 9 and facilitates the transportation of A into APL cells,which in turn enhances A-mediated PML-RARα degradation and therapeuticefficacy. Our data also indicate A as the principal component of the formula,whereas T and I serve as adjuvant ingredients.We therefore suggest that dissecting the mode of action of clinically effective formulae at the molecular,cellular,and organism levels may be a good strategy in exploring the value of traditional medicine.

The complexity of medicine suggests that treatment protocols should be carefully designed,and the construction of a prescription is an art in fighting disease.Increasing evidence demonstrates that, in treating illnesses,including cancer(1) and HIV/AIDS (2), treatment regimens containing multiple drugs with distinct but related mechanisms can usually amplify the therapeutic efficacies of each agent, leading to maximal therapeutic efficacy with minimal adverse effects.Interestingly,combination therapy has been advocated for ${ > } 2 , 5 0 0$ years by prescriptions called formulae (3,4) in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM),a unique medical system assisting the ancient Chinese in dealing with disease.Typically,formulae consist of several types of medicinal herbs or minerals,in which one represents the principal component,and others serve as adjuvant ones to assist the effects or facilitate the delivery of the principal component (3,4).It is believed that,at least in some formulae,multiple components could hit multiple targets and exert synergistic therapeutic efficacies(3,4).However,essential compounds have not been identified in most formulae,whereas precise mechanisms of formulae remain to be addressed by using molecular approaches,thus hampering the modernization of TCM.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL),the M3 type of acute myeloid leukemia(AML),is characterizedbytheaccumulation of immature promyelocytes in bone marrow (BM) and the presence of a specific chromosome translocation t(15;17) (q22;q21),which generates the leukemogenic PML-RARα fusion gene ina vast majority of patients.APL isuniquely sensitive to the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA),which causes the modulation and catabolism of PML-RARα oncoprotein(5,6).Interestingly,arsenic trioxide(ATO) (7,8),an ancient remedy in both TCM andWestern medicine,has been proven effective in treating APL,and the key molecular mechanism has been revealed to be related to the degradation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor $\alpha$ (RARα) (9).A recent report on the ATRA/ATO combination yields the 4-year disease-free survival of ${ > } 9 0 \%$ of APL patients (10).Of note,in parallel to this advancement in the understanding and treatment of APL,accomplished mainly by the hematology/oncology community in China and other countries,a group of TCM doctors in China designed a Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula(RIF) in the 198Os (11) entirely based on TCM theories,in which mined ore,realgar,is the principal element, whereasIndigonaturalis,Salviamiltiorrhiza,andRadixpsudostellariae are adjuvant components to assist the effects of realgar. Intriguingly,recent multicenter clinical trials showed that a complete remission rate of $9 6 . 7 \%$ (12) to $9 8 \%$ (11)and a 5-year overall survival rate of $8 6 . 8 8 \%$ (13）were achieved in APL patients receiving RIF,with moderate adverse effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and rash.Realgar,in combination with Indigonaturalis,also showed anti-APL activity (14).The literature documents the antitumor activity of S.miltiorrhiza (15)，whereas $R .$ psudostellariae is believed to be able to strengthen immune activity and seems not to be essential for RIF.Studies showed that tetraarsenic tetrasulfide $( \mathrm { A s } _ { 4 } \mathrm { S } _ { 4 } , \mathrm { A } )$ (8), indirubin (I) (16),and tanshinone IIA(T) (17) are the major active ingredientsofrealgar,Indigonaturalis,andS.miltiorrhiza, respectively (18).These results not only demonstrate the clinical efficacy of,but also suggest the possible synergistic effects among,the three components of RIF,warranting the mechanistic exploration of this formula.

In trying to approach the rationale of formula design in TCM, here we use the treatment of APL with RIF as a working model. A,I,and T were used as active compounds of realgar,Indigo naturalis,and $S$ ，miltiorrhiza,respectively,and the efficaciesand mechanisms of ATIcombination on APL were tested in vivo and in vitro.

# Results

In Vivo Therapeutic Efficacies of ATl on a Murine APL Model.In FVB/NJ mice injected with $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells expressing PML-RARα (19,20),a statistically significant prolongation of median overall survival was observed in mice treated with ATI combination compared with animals treated with vehicle control or mono- or bitherapy of A, T,and I(Fig. 1A). In the monotherapy groups, A showed the most potent therapeutic efficacy. The ATI protocol decreased the weight of spleen and liver [supporting information (SI) Fig. 6] but did not cause weight loss in animals (Fig.1B).Terminallydifferentiated granulocytesdominated the bone marrow(BM) and spleen of ATI-treated mice but were rare or occurred much less frequently in other treatment groups (SI Fig.7). Consistent with this,cells expressing granulocytic differentiation antigens Gr-1 and Mac-1 in BM and spleens of mice treated with ATI were higher than in other treatment groups (Fig.1C).A or T alone also induced some APL cell differentiation.Unlike vehicle control, the ATI regimen significantly reduced disseminated disease and prevented destruction oftissue architectures (SI Fig.8).These results suggest the ATI combination intensifies therapeutic efficacies,but not adverse effects, on murine APL model.

ATI Causes Synergistic Effects on Human APL Cell Differentiation in Vitro.We found that A or T but notIalone induced a certain degree of morphological features of cell differentiation in a human APL cell line NB4 (21) and primary culture of fresh APL cells,whereas the ATI combination induceda much higherlevel of maturation not only in these cells but also in the ATRAresistant NB4-R2 cells (22) (Fig. 2A). Cells,upon ATI, showed higher activity to produce oxidative bursts detected by the NBT reduction assay and showed up-regulated CD11b/CD14 expression compared with those treated with vehicle or mono- or bitreatment of A,T,and I(Fig. $2 B$ and $C$ ).Totest whether A and/or Tand/orIexert synergic or additive effects on APL cells, the dose-effect curves of single or combined drug treatment were analyzedby the median-effect method (23),where the combination indexes(CI) of less than,equal to,and more than 1indicate synergistic,additive,and antagonistic effects,respectively.We found that A,T,and Iat concentrations ranging from 0.25 to $1 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ had CI values $^ { < 1 }$ (Fig. $2 D$ ),indicating synergic effects among the agents.

ATI Causes Enhanced Ubiquitination and Degradation of PML-RARα Oncoprotein.Like ATO, ${ \bf A s } _ { 4 } { \bf S } _ { 4 }$ is able to trigger the degradation of the PML-RARα oncoprotein (Fig. 3A). Interestingly,T orI augmented A-triggered catabolismofPML-RARα,whereas the ATI combination further enhanced this effect (Fig.3A).Previous studies showed that ATO shifts PML/PML-RAR $\alpha$ from the nucleoplasm onto the nuclear matrix and induces their degradation via the proteasome pathway (24).By Western blot analysis of the PML-RARα contents of RIPA(the cytoplasm and most of the nucleoplasm) and pellet (the nuclear matrix and some chromatin components） fractions (24) in PML-RARα- expressing 293 cells pretreated with proteasome inhibitor MG132,we found that A,but not T and/orI,induced a clear shift from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear matrix and an apparent ubiquitination of PML-RAR $\alpha$ (Fig. $3 B$ ),whereas TI increased A-triggered relocalization and ubiquitination of the oncoprotein (Fig.3 B). Immunofluorescence staining using an anti-PML antibody showed that untreated NB4 and NB4-R2 cells exhibited hundreds of micropunctates in the nuclei and cytoplasm, whereasA down-regulated PML-RAR $\scriptstyle { \alpha }$ and restored the normal PML speckles (SIFig.9).Although T,I, or a TI combination did not affect the staining pattern, these two compounds enhanced the effects of A (SI Fig.9), suggesting that degradation of PML-RAR $\alpha$ byA can be synergized by Tand I. That MG-132 could induce a significant accumulation of PML-RAR $\alpha$ (Fig. $3 B ^ { \prime }$ )provided strong evidence that the synergistic effect of A,T, andI occurred at the level of protein ubiquitination.These data, together with the in vivo and cell biology data, suggest that Ais theprincipal ingredientin this formula,whereas $\mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ and I could serve as adjuvant components.

ATI Triggers Relief of Transcription Suppression.Transcription factors,e.g.，CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs）and PU.1,are critical for normal myelopoiesis and granulocytic maturation and are suppressed in APL.We found that in NB4 cells treated with the ATI combination, $\mathrm { C / E B P } \alpha$ at protein level wasup-regulated on day2and subsequentlydecreased,whereas $\mathbf { C } / \mathbf { E B } \mathbf { \bar { P } } \beta 1 / 2$ and $\mathrm { C } / \mathrm { E B P } \varepsilon$ were up-regulated (Fig. 3 $C$ and $D$ ） Further analysis showed that A or $\mathrm { \Delta T }$ alone modulated these proteins,and combined use of ATI intensified the effect (Fig. $3 C \ `$ ).The oncogene $C$ -Myc blocks myeloid differentiation,and its down-regulation is critical for myeloid cell differentiation (25). Interestingly, down-regulation of C-Myc at both the protein and mRNA levels was detected in cells treated with ATI compared with cells treated with mono- or biagents (Fig. $3 ~ C$ and $D$ ） $R A R \beta 2$ is an RAR target gene that contains the strongest natural RA response element so far (βRARE) in its promoter (26,27).We found that both Tand A up-regulated $R A R \beta 2$ at the mRNAlevel,whereas the ATI combination significantly intensified $R A R \beta 2$ up-regulation (Fig.3E Upper).Using the ChIP assay,we identified the dissociation of $R A R \beta 2$ from histone deacetylase1(HDAC1)(Fig.3ELower),which mightcontribute to the activation of $R A R \beta 2$ transcription.Suppression of transcription factors by the dominant-negative effect of PML-RAR $\alpha$ is involved in APL pathogenesis,and the ATI combination might relieve the repression of the normal function of transcription machinery in APL cells,suggesting the rationality of RIF in treating APL.

ATI Induces $\bf { G } _ { 1 } / \text{ G } _ { 0 }$ Arrest of APL Cells with Effects on Key Regulators of Cell Cycle Progression.We tested whether ATI treatment could act on cell cycle progression and found that T alone increased cellular compartment in the $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 } / \mathbf { G } _ { 0 }$ phase,whereasAT,AI,and TI combinations further caused $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 } / \mathbf { G } _ { 0 }$ blockage (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, $8 3 . 7 \% \pm 6 . 7 \%$ ofNB4 cells treated with ATI were at the $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 } / \mathbf { G } _ { 0 }$ phase,demonstrating an enhanced effect of the compounds in inhibiting the $\mathrm { G } _ { 1 } / \mathrm { S }$ transition (Fig.4A). Similar results were observed in NB4-R2 cells treated with ATI (Fig. $4 A ^ { ' }$ ).Ithas been shown thatIis a potent inhibitor of cyclindependent kinase 2(CDK2),which is critical for cell cycle progression from the $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 }$ to S phase (16).We found that A and I down-regulated CDK2 in NB4 and NB4-R2 cells,whereas the ATI combination further enhanced this effect (Fig. $4 B$ ). CDK2 has been shown to be able to phosphorylate histone H1(28), whereas phosphorylated H1 is increased during the transition from the ${ \bf G } _ { 1 }$ to S phase (29).Regimens containing I markedly decreased phosphorylated H1 (Fig.4C).P27 isan important CDK inhibitor,which negatively regulates the progression from $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 }$ into S phase.We showed that the protein but not the mRNA level of P27 was dramatically increased during A,T, I,and the combinatory treatment on NB4 cells(Figs. $3 D$ and $4 B$ ).TheATI combination also up-regulated P27 in NB4-R2 cells (Fig. 4B Right).Normally,Rb governs cells' entry into the S phase (30). We found that the expression of the Rb protein was slightly increased in treatment groups containing T(T,AT,TI,and ATI) in NB4 cells,whereas hypophosphorylated Rb (hypoPRB,the functional form of Rb as a tumor suppressor in blocking the cell cycle) was significantly up-regulated in the ATI treatment group (Fig.4B).These observations indicated that A,T,andIhad a synergistic/additive effect on inducing $\mathbf { G } _ { 0 } / \mathbf { G } _ { 1 }$ arrest of APL cells.

Tand I Increase Cellular Uptake of Arsenic Through Cooperating with A in Inducing Up-Regulation of the Transmembrane Protein Aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9).It has been shown that AQP9 serves as the transmembrane transporter of arsenic compounds(31).A question can thus be raised: could T and/or Iexert any effect on the transportation ofA through AQP9? To address this,NB4 cells were pretreated with different protocols for4 days,washed,and then incubatedwith $2 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ Afor $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ .Theintracellulararsenic concentration ([Asli)was carefully evaluated by an atomic absorption spectrometer system.Intriguingly, cells treated with ATIhad the highest[Asli,whereas $[ \mathrm { A s } ] _ { \mathrm { i } }$ in cells treated with AT and AI but not TI was higher than in cells treated with A (Fig. 5A),demonstrating that T and/orIassist arsenic uptake.It has been reported that MRP-1 is involved in arsenic efflux(32),and recently,AQP9 has been shown to mediate arsenic uptake by leukemic cells and determine arsenic sensitivity (31).We found that expression of MRP-1 was not changed in NB4 cells treated with these compounds (data not shown).Interestingly,ATI treatment induced strong expression of AQP9 after $2 4 { \mathrm { - } } 9 6 \mathrm { h }$ (Fig. $\textbf { 5 } B$ and $C$ ).Further analysis revealed T,I,orIndirubin- $3 ^ { \prime }$ 1 monoxime $( 3 \mathrm { m } )$ ，an analog of I,cooperated with A in upregulating AQP9 at both the mRNA(Fig.5B) and/or protein (Fig.5C) levels,whereas TI or T3m moderately caused the elevation of AQP9.The immunofluorescence assay confirmed the cooperation of $\mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ and I with A in up-regulating AQP9 expression,whereas the strongest effect was seen in the ATI combination (Fig. $5 D$ ）

To validate the importance of AQP9 in arsenic uptake,RNA interference (RNAi) was used to suppress AQP9 gene expression.Transfection of the AQP9 siRNA expression vector into NB4 cells resulted in a decrease of AQP9 by approximately one-half (Fig. 5E).Consequently，AQP9 silencing led to a decrease of $[ \mathrm { A s } ] _ { \mathrm { i } }$ of cells treated with A,AT,AI,or the ATI combination(Fig. $5 F$ ).Moreover,AQP9knockdown inhibited cell maturation inducedbyATI,asrevealed by CD11b expression (Fig. 5G).These results suggest that AQP9 is critical to arsenic transportation,and $\mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ andI facilitate arsenic uptake through up-regulation of AQP9.

# Discussion

In the past few years,the pharmaceutical industry has seen a shift from the search for“magic bullets” that specifically target a single disease-causing molecule to the pursuit of combination therapies that comprise more than one active ingredient (33).Interestingly, TCMhas advocated combinatory therapeutic strategies for ${ > } 2 , 5 0 0$ years.Based on the symptoms and characteristics of patients and guided by the theories of TCM, formulae are designed to contain a combination of different kinds of plants or minerals to improve clinical efficacy. One example is RIF,whose efficacies in treating APL have been well established recently (12,13).

In this study,we find that, ina murine APL model,combined use of the active components ofRIF,namelyA,T,and I, significantly prolongs the life span of mice bearing PML-RAR $\alpha$ -positive leukemic cells.At the cellular level, the ATI induced the terminal differentiation of APL cellsin vivo and in vitro and overcame ATRAresistance.Assessment of the CIvalue by themedian-effect method directly demonstrates the synergic effect of A,T,and Ion NB4 and NB4-R2 cells.These results clearly show that components ofRIF exert effectsofmutual reinforcement.However,ATI does not show an intensified adverse effect in the APL murine model,as revealed by change in body weight,consistent with the safety of RIF observed in the clinic.These observations are in agreementwith the rationality of the formula: mutual reinforcement of the compounds and reduction of adverse effects.

Alarge bodyof evidence indicatesthat PML-RAR $\scriptstyle { \alpha }$ is the causative oncoprotein ofAPL.Interestingly,A,which exhibits the strongest therapeutic effects in the murine APL model,has also been shown to be the principal agent of RIF in targeting PML-RARα.Furthermore, the TI combination enhances A-induced ubiquitination and degradation of PML-RARα,augmenting the effects ofA.Thus,the RIF formula,although designed by TCM doctors in the premolecular era of APL,proves its rationale by modern biochemical analysis.In addition,PMLRARα acts as a dominant-negative mutant over wild-type ${ \mathrm { R A R } } \alpha$ and prevents the activation of key target genes essential formyeloid differentiation (6).In this study, the ATI combination is found to be able to act on some key transcription factors in myelopoiesis and results in the up-regulation of $\mathrm { C / E B P } \alpha$ ${ \bf C } / \mathrm { E B P } \beta \bar { 1 } / 2$ ，C/EBPε，PU.1，and RARβ2 and the downregulation of C-Myc.Using the ChIP assay，we show that dissociation of RARβ2 from HDAC1 might contribute to the activation of $R A R \beta 2$ transcription.These results indicate that ATI not only targets PML-RAR $\alpha$ but also at least partly restores the normal function of the myeloid cell transcriptional machinery,leadingto the terminal differentiation ofAPL cells.

Maintenance of normal cell cycle progression requires a balance of positive and negative regulators.The effects of ATI on cell cycle distribution are quite interesting,in that a high percentage of cells arrested at the $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 } / \mathbf { G } _ { 0 }$ phase can be reached when the three compounds are used simultaneously in both ATRA-sensitive NB4 andATRA-resistantNB4-R2 cells.In the ATI treatment group, CDK2,a critical regulator of S phase entry (34),is greatly down-regulated,and consequently phosphorylatedH1 is eliminated.In contrast,P27,a well established inhibitor of the cyclin/CDK complex at the transition of the cell cycle,canbesignificantlyinducedbyA,T,andI,particularly when the three compounds are used in combination.In addition, the functional status of the Rb protein,a pivotal factor in the negative control of the cell cycle through repressing the transcription of the gene required for the transition from $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 }$ to S phase,can also be regulated by ATI.Of note，in untreated NB4-R2 and NB4 cells,hypophosphorylated Rb is undetectable, whereas the ATI combination,but not any single agent of the three,significantly induces its expression.This phenomenon not only suggests that ATI might trigger protein modification but also indicates that formulae might exert therapeutic effects through mechanisms beyond each component.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that,in the principle of designing a formula in TCM, some adjuvant components should be considered to facilitate the delivery of the principal element to the disease site in the body.It may be an interesting observation in this work that ATI treatment increases $[ \mathrm { A s } ] _ { \mathrm { i } }$ of NB4 cells compared with arsenic treatment alone,whereas A combined with $\mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ and/or I significantly up-regulates AQP9,a transmembrane protein playing an essential role in arsenic uptake and determining cellular arsenic sensitivity (31).Because AQP9 was up-regulated $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ after ATI treatment,some other events might also be involved in the enhancement of arsenic action by $\mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ and I at the earlier stage. Interestingly,ATI treatment could not up-regulate AQP9 in HL60 or K562 cells (date not shown),indicating a cell context-based selectivity of AQP9 modulation by ATI.Furthermore,the silencing of AQP9 by specific siRNA inhibited arsenic uptake,decreased $[ \mathrm { A s } ] _ { \mathrm { i } }$ ,and inhibited the differentiation ofNB4 cells induced byATI. These results suggest that AQP9 mediates, to a significant extent, the therapeutic effects ofRIF,and that TandImight assist Ain the formula through modulating this key transporter.

In summary,we show that the dissection of the mode of action of clinically well established TCMformulae suchasRIF should be possible by combined application of both analytical and synthetic research approachesat the molecular,cellular,and organism levels. This studymay be considereda useful pilot trial in exploring the value of traditional formulae on a larger scale and in helping to bridge Western and the Eastern medicines in the era of systems biology.
