The Gd-Fe-Al amorphous/nanocrystalline composites were successfully designed and obtained with both high Curie temperature $\mathrm { ( T _ { c } ) }$ and large magnetic entropy change $( \Delta \mathsf { S } _ { \mathrm { M } } )$ . The $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ can be tuned from 172 to $2 8 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ and refrigeration capacity (RC) has a value between 690 and $8 6 7 ~ \mathrm { J / k g }$ under a field change of $0 { - } 5 \mathrm { T }$ by changing the Gd contents and the formation of Gd nanocrystallites.And, $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ in Gd-Fe-Al amorphous/nanocrystalline composites reached a value of $7 . 2 \mathrm { J } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ under a field change of $0 { - } 5 \ \mathrm { T } .$ The high RC in Gd-Fe-Al system were ascribed to the widening full width at half maximum(δFwHM) up to $2 4 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ of the magnetic entropy change $( \Delta \mathrm { S _ { M } } ^ { \mathrm { m a x } } )$ peak because of the combination contribution of amorphous matrix and the precipitated Gd-riched nanocrystalline.Our research would shed light on how to design attractive candidates for magnetic refrigeration materials with high performance at near room temperature. $\circleddash$ 2016 Author(s).All article content,except where otherwise noted,is licensed undera Creative Commons Attribution(CCBY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

# I.INTRODUCTION

Magnetic refrigeration based on magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has attracted increasing attention because of its superior properties,such as high energy effciency and environmental friendliness. Therefore, it is expected to replace traditional vapor-compression refrigeration in the near future.1 For a magnetic refrigeration material,a high magnetic entropy change, $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ ,is important for its application on the point of large adiabatic temperature change.Currently, the large MCE has been extensively studied on various crystalline materials with a first-order magnetic transition,such as $\mathrm { L a } ( \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 - \mathrm { x } } , \mathrm { S i } _ { \mathrm { x } } ) _ { 1 3 }$ ，2.3 $\mathrm { G d } _ { 5 } \mathrm { S i } _ { 2 } \mathrm { G e } _ { 2 }$ 4， $\mathbf { M n F e ( P , A s ) }$ ,5 Ni-Mn-X ( $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { X } } = \mathbf { \boldsymbol { S } } \mathbf { \boldsymbol { n } }$ , In, Sb),6-8 etc. The advantage of these crystalline materials is their large magnetic entropy change.However, due to the first-order magnetic transition,the thermal and magnetic hysteresis is intrinsically unavoidable.Also,the temperature range of full width at half maximum ( $\langle \delta _ { \mathrm { F W H M } } )$ of the magnetic entropy change $( \Delta \mathrm { S _ { M } } ^ { \mathrm { m a x } } )$ （20 peak is only a few to a few tens Kelvin. Therefore,the refrigeration capacity in crystalline materials is small.

The amorphous materials undergo second order magnetic transition which will broaden magnetic entropy change $\mathrm { ( } \Delta  { \mathrm { S } } _ { \mathrm { m } } )$ peaks and result in high values of refrigeration capacity (RC).9-13 They also have some unique properties that are superior to those of crystalline alloys,such as,no thermal and field hysteresis,large electrical resistivity,high corrosion resistance,tailorable magnetic transition temperature, fine molding and processing behavior. These characteristics are technically important for the use of amorphous materials as more suitable candidates in magnetic refrigeration applications.The negative point of amorphous materials is their lower Curie temperatures and lower magnetic entropy change compared to those of their crystalline counterparts, which are important factors need to be solved before their real application as refrigeration materials at room temperature.

Recently, many efforts have been devoted to improving Curie temperatures and magnetic entropy change of amorphous materials in Gd-RE ( $\mathrm { R E } = \mathrm { F e }$ , Co,Ni)-Al systems.14-18 Most of the research focused on the magnetocaloric effect at low temperature. Unfortunately, there are still no amorphous materials having a Curie temperature close to room temperature combined with a high magnetic entropy change under a magnetic field change $( 5 \mathrm { ~ T ~ } )$ . To circumvent this problem,i.e., obtain both high Curie temperature and large magnetic entropy change,in this work, Gd-based amorphous $\left( \mathrm { A m . } \right)$ and nanocrystalline (NC) composites are designed based on the idea of combination effect of amorphous and nanocrystalline composites in which the amorphous part contributes to the wide temperature range of $\delta _ { \mathrm { F W H M } }$ and the nanocrystalline part gives high magnetic entropy change.In this paper, the magnetic properties and evolution of magnetocaloric effect of $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ alloys was systematically investigated. As a result, $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ has been tuned to near room temperature in $\mathrm { A m . / N C }$ composites together with a high $\Delta \mathsf { S } _ { \mathrm { m } }$ and RC.From the best of our knowledge, the RC $( 8 6 7 ~ \mathrm { J / k g } )$ obtained for amorphous and nanocrystalline composites is the highest for allcrystalline and amorphous magnetocaloric effect materials. The reason of high Curie temperature and large magnetic entropy change was discussed and explained.

# II.EXPERIMENTAL

Master alloys of $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ (atomic percent） were prepared by arcmelting a mixture of pure Gd, Fe and Al metals in a titanium-gettred argon atmosphere. The purities of all raw elements are better than $9 9 . 9 \%$ . To guarantee the composition homogeneity, each ingot was repeatedly melted five times.The amorphous ribbons with a thickness of about $2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and a width of about $2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ were produced by melt-spinning technology on a singe-roller copper wheel with a speed of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ .The structure of the as-quenched ribbons was examined by X-ray diffraction（XRD) using $\mathrm { C u } { - } K _ { \mathrm { a } }$ radiation.The thermal properties were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a constant heating rate of $4 0 \mathrm { { K / m i n } }$ under purified argon atmosphere. The samples were contained in aluminum pans.A second run under identical conditions was used to determine the baseline after each run.To confirm the reproducibility of the experimental results,at least three samples were measured for each composition. All measurements for the glass transition temperature $( T _ { g } )$ and the onset temperature of crystallization $( T _ { x } )$ were reproducible within the error of $\pm 1 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ . The magnetic properties were measured by superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (SQUID). The magnetocaloric effect was studied using Maxwell relations by constructing the temperature dependence of $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ from the isothermal magnetization curve.

# III.RESULTSANDDISCUSSIONS

Figure 1(a) shows the $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { X } }$ -ray diffraction patterns of $\mathrm { G d _ { x } } ( \mathrm { F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x }$ 0 $\begin{array} { r } { \dot { \mathbf { x } } = 6 5  – 9 0 \dot { \phantom { 0 } } , } \end{array}$ ribbons. The as-spun ribbons have only broad diffused difraction peaks and no any crystalline peaks can be detected within the resolution of XRD in samples with $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { x } } = 6 5$ ，70,and 73.5,which indicates an amorphous structure in these ribbons.However, obvious crystaline peaks indexed as $\mathrm { G d } _ { 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 }$ and Gd phases can be seen in samples with $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ and $\mathbf { x } = 9 0$ ，which reveals the presence of nanocrystallines.The grain size of $\mathrm { G d } _ { 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 }$ and Gd was calculated by Debye-Scherrer formula. And, the average size of $\mathrm { G d } _ { 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 }$ and Gd was approximately $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and $2 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ,respectively. The differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the thermal properties of as-spun ribbons.The continuous DSC traces obtained from the $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ at a heating rate of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { K / m i n }$ are shown in Figure 1(b). The glass transition can be sheltered by the DSC background noise.To eliminate the background noise in DSC measurement,a refined DSC measurement was performed.The same ribbon was measured twice,firstly,in the amorphous state and secondly after crystallization was complete. The DSC curves of $\mathrm { G d _ { x } } ( \mathrm { F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } } ) _ { 1 0 0 - \mathrm { x } }$ 0 $\mathrm { \ddot { x } } = 6 5  – 7 3 . 5 \mathrm { \cdot }$ alloy show distinct endothermic glass transition before several exothermic crystallization reactions. However, no glass transition phenomenon is seen in the temperature range below crystallization temperature for $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ and 90,which indicates that the glass transition temperature $( \mathrm { T } _ { g } )$ is estimated to be higher than $\mathrm { T } _ { x }$ ：

FIG. 1. (a) $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ -ray diffraction patterns of as-quenched $\mathrm { G d _ { x } } ( \mathrm { F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( \mathrm { x } = 6 5 . 9 0 )$ ribbons and (b) DSC curves for as-quenched $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - } }$ X $( \mathbf { x } = 6 5 . 9 0 )$ ribbons.

Figure 2 presents the temperature dependence of magnetization of $\mathbf { G } \mathbf { d } _ { \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } } ) _ { 1 0 0 - \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { x }$ $= 6 5 – 9 0 \AA$ ribbons under an applied field of $2 0 0 \mathrm { O e }$ .The Curie temperatures $\mathrm { ( T _ { c } ) }$ , which are defined as the temperature at the maximum of $\lvert \mathrm { d } M / \mathrm { d } T \rvert$ ，where $\mathbf { M }$ is magnetization and $\mathrm { \Delta T }$ is temperature, is shown in the inset of Fig. 2.For $\mathbf { x } = 6 5$ , 70 and 73.5, $\vert \mathrm { d } M / \mathrm { d } T \vert$ displays only one maximum originating from the glassy ribbons.However, for $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ and $\mathbf { x } = 9 0$ ,there are obviously two maxima which indicates the appearance of multiple Curie temperatures.The higher Curie temperature should be ascribed to the ferromagnetic transition of the nanocrystalites.12 With the increase of temperature,the magnetization (Figure 2) decreases,resulting from the magnetic transition from a ferromagnetic (FM) ordered state to a paramagnetic (PM) ordered state. For the as spun ribbons having only glassy phase without any nanocrystallites, $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ is dominantly determined by the ferromagnetic Fe-Fe exchange interaction.13,14 Hence, an increase in Fe concentration wil result in an increase of $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ from $1 7 2 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ to $1 9 2 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ in $\mathbf { G } \mathbf { d } _ { \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { F e } _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } \mathbf { A l } _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - \mathrm { x } }$ （ $\mathbf { \dot { x } } = 6 5  – 7 3 . 5$ ）alloys.However, $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ of $\mathbf { G } \mathbf { d } _ { \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { F e } _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } \mathbf { A l } _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - \mathrm { x } }$ 0 $\mathbf { \Phi } _ {  X  } = 8 0 \mathbf { \Phi } \mathbf { , 9 0 } $ ）amorphous/nanocrystalline system is very sensitive to the composition and the formation of nanocrystalites.After the precipitation of Gd-riched nanoparticles,the Fe concentration in the amorphous matrix increased. Therefore, $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ in amporphous matrix increased to 206 and $2 1 2 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ for samples with $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ and 90,respectively. And, the second $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ (second maxima in the inset of Fig.2) was ascribed to the precipitated Gd-riched nanocrystalline phase, Gd and/or $\mathrm { G d } _ { 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 }$

FIG.2.Temperature dependence of the magnetization of $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ ribbons under an applied field of $2 0 0 \mathrm { O e }$ .The inset shows the derivative curves of dM/dT vs.T.

In Fig.2,at the lowest temperature the $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { x } } = 6 5$ and 7O samples have a magnetization of about $1 6 0 \mathrm { \ e m u / g }$ ,while the $\mathbf { x } = 7 3 . 5$ sample goes up to almost $2 2 0 \mathrm { \ e m u / g }$ .The possible reason may be the fully amorphousnature of samples $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { x } } = 6 5$ and 7O,while it has inhomogeneous structure in atomic scale for $\mathbf { x } = 7 3 . 5$ sample,even if it is amorphous within XRD resolution.For example,it was reported that Gd-Fe-Al amorphous alloy was obtained according to XRD results, however there was Fe-rich clusters existing in Gd-Fe-Al amorphous matrix proved by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Ref.19.In other words, $\mathbf { x } = 7 3 . 5$ sample is fully amorphous from XRD patterns. However, it may be atomically inhomogeneous like that in Ref.19. On the other side,due to the precipitation of Fe-rich clusters,the content of Gd will increase,and the Gd-Gd interaction will increase,and this will also induce the high magnetization.Additionally, in Refs.14-16, no amorphous alloy having Gd content more than $70 \%$ was obtained.Then for $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ sample,magnetization drops to about $1 5 0 \mathrm { \ e m u / g }$ because of the precipitation of nanocrystalline $\mathrm { G d } _ { 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 }$ which having a low saturation magnetization.2o As for the $\mathbf { x } = 9 0$ sample,magnetization increases to $90 \%$ of that $X = 7 3 . 5$ .The reason is ascribed to the precipitated nano-sized Gd-rich crystalline havingahigh saturationmagnetization.

Figure 3(a) displays the isothermal magnetization curves measured in a temperature range of $4 2 { - } 2 7 7 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ under a magnetic field up to $5 \mathrm { T }$ for $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 7 0 ) }$ glassy ribbons as an example.In the vicinity of $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ ,from 162 to $1 9 7 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ ，the temperature step is $5 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ and in faraway regions of $4 2 . 1 6 2 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ and 197-277 K, the temperature step is $2 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ .The sweeping rate of the field was slow enough to ensure that the magnetization curves are obtained in an isothermal process. To further understand the magnetic transitions,the Arrot plots ( $M ^ { 2 }$ versus $H / M$ curves）were also analyzed.According to Banerjee criterion,a magnetic transition is considered as first-order when the slope of Arrott plot is negative; otherwise, it is expected to be second-order when the slope is positive.21 The inflection or negative slope as an indication of metamagnetic transition above $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ is not observed in Figure 3(b),which indicates that the magnetic transition at $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ for the $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 7 0 ) }$ alloy is a second order magnetic transition. Similarly,other $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ ternary alloys also have a nature of the second-order phase magnetic transition (not shown here).

Figure 4 shows the magnetic entropy change $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ of $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ ribbons as a function of temperature under a field change of $5 \mathrm { T }$ $\Delta \mathrm { S } _ { \mathrm { M } }$ for $\mathbf { G } \mathbf { d } _ { \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } } ) _ { 1 0 0 - \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { x }$ $= 6 5 – 9 0 \AA$ ribbons was calculated in a magnetic field change of $0 { - } 5 \mathrm { T }$ according to isothermal magnetization curves shown in Fig. 3 around $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ by using Maxwell relationships. The curie temperature $\mathrm { ( T _ { c } ) }$ , maximum magnetic entropy change $( \Delta \mathsf { S } _ { \mathrm { M } } )$ , the full width at half maximum of $\Delta \mathrm { S } _ { \mathrm { M } }$ (δTFWHM) and refrigeration capacity (RC) for $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ ribbons are summarized in Table I. The maximum value of $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ ranges from 5.0 to $7 . 2 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } ~ K ^ { - 1 } }$ under a field change of $5 \mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ for $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ . These values are comparable to those of many previously published results for Gd-based crystalline and metallic glass with a second-order phase transition. For example, it has been reported that $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ is ${ \sim } 3 . 7 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } ~ K ^ { - 1 } }$ (5T) for GdFeAl, $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ is ${ \sim } 4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } ~ K ^ { - 1 } }$ (5T) for $\mathrm { G d } _ { 6 0 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 2 0 } \mathrm { C o } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 1 0 } .$ $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ is ${ \sim } 1 0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } ~ K ^ { - 1 } }$ (5T) for $\mathrm { \ G d C u A l }$ $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ is ${ \sim } 9 . 8 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } ~ K ^ { - 1 } }$ (5T) for GdCoAl.13,22.23 A11 $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5 - 9 0 ) }$ alloys exhibit very high STFwHM Values. The value of $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ of the amorphous/nanocrystalline composite specimen with $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ is smaller than those of the amorphous specimens with $\mathbf { x } = 6 5 \ – 7 3 . 5$ and Am./NC with $\mathbf { x } = 9 0$ .For higher Gd content specimens,such as $\mathrm { A m . / N C ~ x } = 9 0 .$ ，the reason can be ascribed to the different weight percent of amorphous and nanocrystlline parts. Different weight percent of amorphous can be seen from the XRD peaks and exothermic peaks in Fig.1(a) and 1(b). The specimen $\mathbf { x } = 9 0$ has a higher Gd concentration and a lower content of amorphous part, thus a higher $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ was obtained compared to that of $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ .Compared with the lower Gd-containing ribbons, for example,glassy specimens, specimen $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ has a slightly lowered $\Delta \mathrm { S _ { M } }$ .The main reason is the nanocrystalline of Gd and Gd-riched compound. It was reported that with the decrease of Gd grains from micrometer to nanometer range, magnetic entropy change drops surprising from 10.07 to $4 . 4 7 \mathrm { J } \log ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ .24 Here, the average size of ${ \bf G } { \bf d } _ { 3 } { \bf A } { \bf l } _ { 2 }$ and Gd in $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ is about $2 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ,and the size of Gd in $\mathbf { x } = 9 0$ is about $2 8 \mathrm { n m }$ .Therefore,the nano-sized Gd has a smaller $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ compared to that of bulk Gd.

It has been reported that comparing with crystalline magnetic refrigeration materials,amorphous magnetocaloric materials will exhibit higher STFwHm values due to the disordered structure resulting from their amorphous nature.23.25 Fu et al.26 have investigated the magnetic properties and $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ of Gd-Co-Al glassy/compound composites and found the table-like magnetocaloric effect (MCE) by suck-casting $\mathrm { G d } _ { 5 2 . 5 } \mathrm { C o } _ { 1 6 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 3 1 }$ which has a glassy structure and crystalline phases of $\mathrm { G d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { A l }$ and $\mathrm { G d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C o } _ { 2 } \mathrm { A l }$ . However,Ref.26, the table-like MCE $( \Delta \mathrm { S _ { M } } \sim 7 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } ~ K ^ { - 1 } } )$ was located between

The RC values can be used to calculate by a variety of methods.23.25.27 In the present work the RC values are determined by numerically integrating the area under the $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ -T curve with a full width at half maximum of the peak as the integrating limits.28 In this work, the maximum RC value under a field change of $0 { - } 5 \mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ reaches $8 6 7 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ for $\mathrm { G d } _ { 8 0 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 1 . 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 8 . 7 }$ amorphous/nanocrystalline alloy,while the minimum value is $6 9 0 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ for $\mathrm { G d } _ { 7 0 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 7 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 1 3 }$ alloy,which is higher than that of most classical crystalline magnetic refrigeration materials,such as Gd $( 5 5 6 ~ \mathrm { J ~ \ k g ^ { - 1 } } ) ^ { 1 5 }$ and $\mathrm { L a F e } _ { 1 1 . 4 } \mathrm { S i } _ { 1 . 6 }$ $( 4 3 9 \mathrm { J } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } )$ .28

What is the deep reason of the Gd-based Am./NC having large magnetic entropy change than that of monolithic Gd-based metallic glass? One thing need to be mentioned is that in the inset of Figure 2, there are two peaks indicating two Curie temperatures for $\mathbf { x } = 8 0$ alloy.And,the former was ascribed to the amorphous phase,and the latter was atributed to the Gd-riched phases, $\mathrm { G d } _ { 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 }$ and Gd. The Curie temperature of the amorphous part changes with the compositional change because of the precipitated Gd-riched nanocrystalline phase,and the Curie temperature of bulk $\mathrm { G d } _ { 3 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 }$ and bulk Gd is $2 8 1 \mathrm { K }$ and $2 9 8 \mathrm { K }$ , respectively.20 However, apparently, there is only one $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ peak in Figure 4, which gives a signal of combination effect of disordered part (amorphous material) and crystal part (nano-sized Gd-riched phase). In other words,amorphous part will contribute to the wider temperature range of full width at half maximum $( \delta \mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { F W H M } } )$ and nanocrystalline will contribute to the high Curie temperature and higher magnetic entropy change. Therefore, the better comprehensive properties of Gd-based amorphous/nanocrystalline composites were obtained which is beter than that of most classical crystalline magnetic refrigeration materials.And,also,our current research could shed a light on how to design and/or discover new refrigeration materials, for example,to make full use of the advantages of both amorphous and crystal materials.

# IV.CONCLUSIONS

The $\mathrm { G d _ { x } ( F e _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } A l _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - x } ( x = 6 5  – 9 0 ) }$ glassy alloys were prepared by the melt spinning technique at a wheel speed of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ . A magnetic second-order transition is justified by the Arrott plot for these alloys.The Curie temperature in $\mathbf { G } \mathbf { d } _ { \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { F e } _ { 0 . 5 6 6 } \mathbf { A l } _ { 0 . 4 3 4 } ) _ { 1 0 0 - \mathrm { x } } ( \mathrm { x } = 6 5 . 9 0 )$ systems can be tuned from 172 to $2 8 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ . The wide ${ \delta \mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { F W H M } } }$ as large as $2 4 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ should be ascribed to the amorphous disordered structure. The large magnetic entropy change which can be tuned from 5.0 to $7 . 2 ~ \mathrm { J ~ k g ^ { - 1 } ~ K ^ { - 1 } }$ under $5 0 \ \mathrm { k O e }$ was obtained for Gd-based $\mathrm { A m . / N C }$ composites. The refrigeration capacity (RC) values of these alloys are located in the range of $6 9 0 { \sim } 8 6 7 ~ \mathrm { J / k g }$ under a magnetic field change of $0 { - } 5 \ \mathrm { T } .$ The large $\Delta S _ { \mathrm { M } }$ and high $\mathrm { T _ { c } }$ makes Gd-based amorphous/nanocrystalline composites atractive candidate for magnetic refrigeration materials at near room temperature.
