Abstract New findings of galeaspids (Agnatha) including Altigibbaspis huiqingae gen. et sp. nov.,an indeterminate polybranchiaspid, Eugaleaspis changi,and Nanpanaspis microculus are described from the lower part of the Xishancun Formation (early Lochkovian, Early Devonian） near the northeast entrance of Liaokuo Park, Qujing City,Yunnan Province, China. The Polybranchiaspis-like new genus is characterized by a blade-like median dorsal ridge on the dorsal side of head-shield. The morphological disparity of the median dorsal ridge and spine in galeaspids suggests that these structures functioned more than providing a hydrodynamic stability. We assume that a high upright and compressed spine may render galeaspid fishes an apparently larger size as seen by a predator,and a blade-like median dorsal ridge may accomplish a defense against the claws of large sea scorpions. Nanpanaspis is peculiar in bearing two short laterally projecting processes on each side of the head-shield,and its phylogenetic relationship is discussed based on diffrent interpretations on the/homology of these processes. Considering the unique morphology of Nanpanaspis,and its early occurrence among the Huananaspiformes, we assign Nanpanaspis in the monogeneric family Nanpanaspidae to represent an early branch of the Huananaspiformes.

# 1 Introduction

Quijing District of Yunnan Province in South China holds a succession of non-marine Lower Devonian strata (Fig.1A), which is subdivided into the Xishancun, Xitun, Guijiatun and Xujiachong formations in ascending order (Fig.1B). The Devonian Xishancun Formation is underlain conformably by the Silurian Yulungssu Formation,and overlain conformably by the Xitun Formation (Fig.1B) (Zheng and Zhang,1989; Dong,1992; Zeng et al.,1992; Fan and Liu,1995; Shan and Wang, 2Oo0). The Xishancun Formation mainly comprises gray-yellow sandstone and siltstone intercalated with silty shale (Fang et al.,1985),yielding a diversified early vertebrate assemblage including galeaspids (Agnatha), placoderms and sarcopterygians (Liu,1965,1975; P'an and Wang,1978; Wang and Dong,1989; Wang,1995a, b; Wang, 2000; Zhu,1992, Zhu and Schultze,1997; Zhu et al.,1999;Gai and Zhu, 2007; Zhao and Zhu, 2010; Liu et al.,2015; Si et al., 2015). Thus far,12 genera and 17 species of galeaspids have been known from the Xishancun Formation (Liu et al.,2015; Si et al.,2015). Here, some new findings of galeaspids including Altigibbaspis huiqingae gen. et sp. nov. an indeterminate polybranchiaspid, Eugaleaspis changi,and Nanpanaspis microculus are described from the lower part of the Xishancun Formation near the northeast entrance of Liaokuo Park in Qujing City (Fig.1C). The new materials were collected by the first author in the 1980s from a siltstone lenticle of less than $1 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ large and about $5 \ \mathrm { c m }$ thickness. The fish-bearing lenticle, which is embedded in a medium-thick layer of yellow sandstone, yielded mainly small galeaspid and placoderm fragments, which indicate a heterochthonous burial. It is noteworthy that the type specimens of $E$ .changi and $N .$ microculus were erroneously assumed to be from the Xitun Formation in their original description (Liu, 1965,1975,1979). Actually, all of them were excavated from the middle part of the Xishancun Formation together with Szelepis yunnanensis (Actinolepidae,Arthrodira) at another site of Liaokuoshan (formerly Liaojiaoshan,Liu, 1979). he

SubclassGaleaspida Tarlo,1967 Supraorder Polybranchiaspidida Janvier, 1996 Order PolybranchiaspiformesLiu, 1965 FamilyPolybranchiaspidaeLiu,1965 Genus Altigibbaspis gen. nov.

EtymologyThe generic name derives from alt (L.), high, gibb (L.), hunchback, and aspis (Gr.), shield, which is often used as suffix of generic name of Agnatha, in reference to the hump profile of the head-shield with the presence of a robust and high median dorsal ridge.

Type species Altigibbaspis huiqingae gen. et sp. nov.

Diagnosis As for the type species.

Altigibbaspis huiqingae gen. et sp. nov.

Holotype A nearly complete head-shield, IVPP V 20843.1 (Fig. 2A-C).

Paratype An incomplete head-shield, IVPP V 20843.2 (Fig. 2D).

EtymologyThe specific name honors the late Mrs. Hu Hui-Qing of IVPP, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for her contributions to the exquisite drawings of fossil vertebrates.

Locality and Horizon Near the northeast entrance of Liaokuo Park, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China; Xishancun Formation, Early Devonian (early Lochkovian).

DiagnosisA medium-sized polybranchiaspid with a robust and high median dorsal ridge on the dorsal side of head-shield; the posterior margin of the shield deeply embayed and bearing a dorsal spine in the middle; the inner corners extending backward, well beyond the median dorsal spine; the lateral transverse canals not branching off in their ends; the dorsal commissure anteriorly situated at the first two fifths of the shield.

RemarksThe new genus Altigibbaspis resembles closely Polybranchiaspis in the outline of the head-shield, the relative position of the median dorsal opening and orbital openings,the distribution pattern of sensory canals,and large ornamental tubercles. They differ in the extension of inner corners,the relative position of the dorsal commissure,and the development degree of the median dorsal ridge on the head-shield in particular.The inner corner is moderately developed in Polybranchiaspis with its posterior tip level with the end of the median dorsal spine,while the inner corner is greatly developed in Altigibbaspis,with its posterior tip well beyond the end of the median dorsal spine.The dorsal commissure is located in the first two-fifths of the head-shield in Altigibbaspis and at about midway of the headshield length in Polybranchiaspis.The median dorsal ridge in Altigibbaspis is high and robust, keeping the same height almost along its whole trajectory, and sloping down near the posterior margin of the head-shield.By contrast, the median dorsal ridge in Polybranchiaspis raises gradually backward along its whole trajectory, and finally projects beyond the posterior margin of the head-shield to form a cone-shaped spine.

Description The new form is a medium-sized polybranchiaspid fish. The head-shield is longitudinal ovoid in shape with a deeply embayed posterior margin. The holotype (V 20843.1) is three-dimensionally preserved with the maximum length of $6 2 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ (from the rostral margin to the tip of the inner corner), the maximum breadth of $5 2 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and the maximum height of $1 7 . 7 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ (Figs.2A-C,3A-C). The paratype(V 20843.2) is an incomplete headshield,and its preserved portion has the maximum length of $5 7 . 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，the maximum breadth of $4 9 . 6 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and the preserved height of $1 1 . 3 5 \mathrm { m m }$ (Fig.2D). On the dorsal side of the headshield,immediately behind the dorsal commissure (dcm, Fig.3A,B,D),a robust and high median dorsal ridge (md.r, Fig.3A-D) raises abruptly along the midline. The ridge extends backward horizontally for about $1 5 . 9 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，then slopes down rapidly as it approaches the posterior margin of the head-shield.The ridge looks like a hunchback in lateral view, and becomes blade-like dorsally (Fig.3B). The posterior margin of head-shield is deeply embayed, and bears a short median dorsal spine (md.s,Fig.3A,B,D) in the middle.The inner corners (ic,

Fig.3A,B,D) are broad and lobate,and extend backward well behind the median dorsal spine

Several sensory organs are visible on the dorsal side of the head-shield.A large median dorsal opening for nostrils (md.o,Figs.2,3A,B,D) is set in the anterior part of the headshield.It is transversal oval in outline with the breadth/length ratio of about 2.0. The long and short axes of the median dorsal opening are $1 0 . 9 7 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and $5 . 5 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ respectively in the holotype, and $1 0 . 6 7 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and $5 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ respectively in the paratype.The length ratio between the median dorsal opening and the head-shield is about O.10,which is evidently smaler than that of most polybranchiaspids. A pair of orbital openings (orb, Figs. 2A,D, 3A, B, D) are anterodorsally placed on the head-shield, but posterior to the median dorsal opening. The distance between orbital openings is $2 1 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ in the holotype.The orbits are round and medium-sized with the diameter range from 4.22 to $5 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in two specimens.There is no pineal opening as in most galeaspids (Liu et al.,2O14),and the pineal area shows no difference from the surface around it.

The sensory canals are exposed as grooves. The sensory canal system displays a typical polybranchiaspid pattern in distribution,which includes the supraorbital system ( $\mathrm { \mathop { s o c } } _ { 1 }$ $\mathbf { s o c } _ { 2 }$ ,Fig. 3A,B,D), the infraorbital system (ifc,ldc,ltc,Fig. 3A,B,D) and a dorsal commissure (dcm, Fig. 3A,B,D). The supraorbital system consists of anterior and posterior supraorbital canals. The anterior supraorbital canal ( $\mathrm { \dot { s o c } } _ { 1 }$ ,Fig.3A,B,D) reaches the rostral margin anteriorly,and converges posteriorly with the posterior supraorbital canal and the infraorbital canal at a level of the middle of the median dorsal opening.The posterior supraorbital canals ( $\mathrm { \tilde { s o c } } _ { 2 }$ Fig.3A,B, D) of both sides converge posteriorly at a level of the posterior end of the orbital opening, and are V-shaped.The infraorbital system consists of the infraorbital canal (ifc,Fig.3A,B,D), the lateral dorsal canal (ldc,Fig.3A,B,D) and four lateral transversal canals ( $\mathrm { l t c } _ { 1 - 4 } ,$ Fig. 3A,B, D) issuing from the lateral dorsal canal.The dorsal commissure (dcm,Fig.3A,B,D) is in the first two fifths of the head-shield,and connects the lateral dorsal canals of both sides.

The ornamentation is poorly known from polygonal impressions as the exoskeleton was weathered away. Each polygonal impression is a natural mould of the basal depression of one tubercle (Tong-Dzuy et al., 1995). The polygonal impressions are large and comparable in size with those of Polybranchiaspis liaojiaoshanensis,accordingly their ornamental tubercles are probably similar in size.

Description The referred specimens are a part of head-shield from the posterior margin of the median dorsal opening (md.o, Fig. 4) to the dorsal commissure (dcm,Fig. 4). The long posterior margin of the median dorsal opening suggests that the width of the opening is probably much greater than its length. The orbital openings (orb,Fig. 4) are dorsally placed. The anterior supraorbital canals ( $\mathrm { \mathop { s o c } } _ { 1 }$ ,Fig. 4) join the posterior supraorbital canals ( $\mathrm { \tilde { s o c } } _ { 2 }$ ,Fig.4), which converge posteriorly at a point just behind the pineal macula (pi.m, Fig. 4) as in most polybranchiaspids. The external mound reveals the ornamental tubercles as large as those in some polybranchiaspids such as Polybranchiaspis (Liu,1965,1975)and Laxaspis (Liu,1975), but the top of the tubercles is flat rather than pointed as in Polybranchiaspis and Laxaspis.In the new specimen, the distance from the posterior margin of the median dorsal opening to the dorsal commissure is $3 3 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ .This distance is about the same as that of $L$ qujingensis $( 3 2 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ 1 but much smaller than that of $P .$ liaojiaoshanensis( $2 1 . 0 0 \mathrm { m m }$ ）

Referred specimens An incomplete head-shield IVPP V 20844.1a and its natural mould V 20844.1b; a fragmentary head-shield V 20844.2a and its natural mould V 20844.2b.

Locality and horizon Near the northeast entrance of Liaokuo Park, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China; Xishancun Formation, Early Devonian (early Lochkovian).

Description The specimen V 20844.la is an incomplete head-shield with the corners missing (Fig. 5A), and its natural mould V 20844.1b (Fig. 5B) preserved the posterior margin of the head-shield. Only a fragment of the left side of the head-shield is preserved in V 20844.2a (Fig. 5C) and its natural mould V 20844.2b (Fig. 5D). Like the holotype of Eugaleaspis changi, the new specimens bear a longitudinal slit-like median dorsal opening,of which the length is about 6 times the breadth (md.o,Fig.5A,E). Other resemblances include the distribution pattern of the sensory canals and the size. The anterior supraorbital canals （ $\mathrm { \mathop { s o c } } _ { 1 }$ ,Fig. 5A,E) are nearly parallel to the median dorsal opening and do not connect with the posterior supraorbital canals ( $\mathrm { \bf \underline { { s o c } } } _ { 2 }$ ,Fig.5A,E). The head-shield length in midline is $3 6 . 5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ in V 20844.1a, approaching that of $3 7 . 5 0 \mathrm { m m }$ in the holotype V 2981 (Liu,1965).As the headshield of galeaspids is a sutureless carapace, they probably acquire their bony skeleton only at full growth and therefore each species has a limited size range.The positions of the orbital openings, the median dorsal opening and the pineal macula are also the same as those of the holotype.It is noteworthy that the so-called“pineal opening” in the holotype in the original description (Liu,1965,1975) is actually an artificial pore,because a pineal macula does appear in the natural mould of the holotype (Liu et al., 2014).

# 3 Discussion

# 3.1Morphological disparity of median dorsal ridge and spine in galeaspids

The median dorsal ridge (md.r, Fig.7A-C) is widely present in galeaspids except eugaleaspidiforms, and can be morphologically classified into three types (Fig. 7).In the first type,the ridge (md.r,Fig.7A) starts just behind the dorsal commissure, rises gradually, and projects beyond the posterior margin of the head-shield to form a cone-shaped spine (md.s,Fig. 7A). This type is widely seen in Hanyangaspis (Pan, 1986, dsp:fig. 3A), many polybranchiaspids such as Polybranchiaspis (Liu, 1975, d.sp:fig. 5), Laxaspis (Liu, 1975, d.sp:fig. 6), Damaspis (Wang and Wang,1982a, dsp:fig.1),and most huananaspids such as Huananaspis (Liu, 1973:fig. 3), Sanchaspis (Pan and Wang, 1981:fig.1),and Antiquisattiaspis (Liu,1985:fig.1).Inthesecond type,the median dorsalridge (md.r,Fig.7B)startsjustbhind the dorsal commissure as well, but rises steeply to form a high upright and compressed spine (md.s,Fig. 7B). This type is only found in the two forms, Siyingia altuspinosa (Fig. 7B) (Wang and Wang,1982b) and Hyperaspis acclivis (Pan,1992:fig.35). In the third type exemplified by Altigibbaspis,the median dorsal ridge (md.r, Fig. 7C) is blade-like,and keeps the same height almost in its whole trajectory, but slopes down close to the posterior margin of the headshield. Most galeaspids are bottom-dwellers on sandy or muddy substrates in marginal marine environment (Janvier,1996, Gai et al., 2015). The median dorsal ridge probably provides hydrodynamic stability in moderate currents with a less energetic cost, which is functionally analogous to the vertical stabilizer of an aircraft. The morphological disparity of median dorsal ridge and spine probably indicates some additional functions developed in galeaspids. Considering the large aquatic, predatory sea scorpions (eurypterids) from the Xishancun Formation (cover image), e.g., a huge claw of Pterygotidae gen. et sp. indet., which was erroneously assumed to be from the Xitun Formation in its original description (Wang and Gai, 2014),we suggest that a high upright and compressed spine may render galeaspid fishes an apparently larger size as seen by a predator (Janvier,1996),and a blade-like median dorsal ridge may accomplish a defense against the claws of sea scorpions.

# 3.2The phylogenetic position of Nanpanaspis

The phylogenetic position of Nanpanaspis has been debated all along. When Nanpanaspis was erected (Liu,1965), it was indeterminate in family and order.Liu (1975) proposed a family Nanpanaspidae and an order Nanpanaspiformes for the genus. Janvier (1975) tentatively assigned Nanpanaspis to an indeterminate family of the Polybranchiaspiformes, and Zhu and Gai (2Oo6) regarded it as the sister taxon of Asiaspis within the Huananaspidae. To a certain extent, the controversy is due to different interpretations of some structures in Nanpanaspis. The head-shield of Nanpanaspis is roughly pentagonal in shape with a slender and pointed rostral process. Compared with the other galeaspids, Nanpanaspis is peculiar in bearing two short laterally projecting processes (lp.a, lp.p, Fig. 6C) and a notch (not, Fig. 6C) between them. Zhu and Gai (2006) suggested that the anterior and posterior lateral processes are homologous with the corner and inner corner of the Huananaspidae respectively (c,ic, Fig. 8A). However, compared with the laterally projecting corner of the Huananaspidae, the anterior process of Nanpanaspis is positioned more anteriorly and close to the level of orbital opening (orb, Fig. 8A). Its posterior process is laterally projecting, whereas the inner corner in the Huananaspidae is posteriorly projecting. Therefore, the homology of the two processes of Nanpanaspis with the corner and inner corner of the Huananaspidae is not convincing enough.

If the two processes are merely considered as the by-product of the marginal notch without any homology with the corner and iner corner of other galeaspids, Nanpanaspis willresemble Gumuaspis in the possession of a rostral process and in the absence of the corners (Wang and Wang,1992). Accordingly, it should be referred to the Polybranchiaspiformes (Fig. 8B).

Another possibility is that the anterior and posterior lateral processes in Nanpanaspis are compared to the orbital process and laterally projecting corner in Lungmenshanaspis respectively,and the notch is compared to the concave lateral margin of the head-shield in Lungmenshanaspis (P'an et al., 1975; Wang et al., 1996). Lungmenshanaspis, whose type species is $L$ 、kiangyouensis (Fig. 8C, middle),was referred to the Huananaspidae (P'an et al., 1975).A prominent process (or.p, Fig.8C) is set along the lateral margin of the head-shield at the level of the orbital openings (orb,Fig.8C) in Lungmenshanaspis,while the margin from the process to the corner of the head-shield is deeply concave (not,Fig.8C). Based on this outline, Wang (l991） speculated that there exists a lateral fenestra in each side of the head-shield as in Qingmenaspis (Pan and Wang,1981:fig. 3). He concluded that the orbital process and the concave margin are artificial structures caused by the broken lateral margin of the fenestra. Wang et al. (1996) described another species of Lungmenshanaspis,L. yunnanensis (Fig. 8C, left) whose prominent orbital process (or.p,Fig. 8C) and concave margin (not, Fig. 8C) are strikingly similar to those of L. kiangyouensis (Fig. 8C, middle). The perfect preservation of L. yunnanensis indicates that the orbital process and the concave margin are natural structures, particularly considering that the concave margin is equipped with some denticles, which are continually distributed in the corner as wel (Wang et al.,1996). Consequently,the So-called “lateral fenestra” does not exist in Lungmenshanaspis. The anterior process (or.p, Fig. 8C) of Nanpanaspis is strikingly similar to the orbital process of Lungmenshanaspis, considering( its small size and anterior position leveling with the orbital opening (orb,Fig.8C). If this homology stands, Nanpanaspis could be resolved as a close relative of Lungmenshanaspis within the Huananaspiformes (Fig. 8C).

Nanpanaspis sister to Asiaspis within Huananaspidae (from Zhu and Gai, 2006); B.Nanpanaspis sister to Gumuaspis within Polybranchiaspiformes; C.Nanpanaspis sister to Lungmenshanaspis within Huananaspiformes; D. Nanpanaspis referred to the monogeneric family Nanpanaspidae provisionally representing an early branch of Huananaspiformes Abbreviations: or.p. orbital process 眶突;other abbreviations as in Figs.2-6,scale bar=1 cm

Taking the three possibilities above together, we tend to accept the homologue of the anterior process of Nanpanaspis with the corner of the Huananaspidae, but doubt the homologue of the posterior process with the inner corner because the inner corner in the Huananaspidae usually has a position behind the level of the posterior margin of the headshield,and projects caudally. The notch between the anterior and posterior processes is probably comparable to the armpit-like sinus of other galeaspids such as Kwangnanaspis subtriangularis (Cao,1979:fig.1; Liu et al.,2015:fig.99), Eugaleaspis xujiachongensis (Liu, 1975:fig.2; Liu et al., 2015:fig. 89). Considering the unique morphology of Nanpanaspis, which is hard to be compared to other galeaspids,and its early occurrence among the

Huananaspiformes, we assign Nanpanaspis to the mono-generic family Nanpanaspidae, which provisionally represents an early branch of the Huananaspiformes (Fig. 8D).

摘要：本文描述了云南曲靖早泥盆世西山村组盔甲鱼类(无颌类)的新发现，包括一新属、新种———惠清驼背鱼(Altigibbaspis huiqingae gen.et sp.nov.),一件属种未定的多鳃鱼科标本，以及张氏真盔甲鱼(Eugaleaspis changi)和小眼南盘鱼(Nanpanaspis microculus)的新材料。驼背鱼在很多方面跟多鳃鱼都非常相似，但头甲背面具一特征性的驼背状隆起，其上有一刀刃状的中背脊。中背脊和中背棘在盔甲鱼类里的形态分异度表明：它们除了能够提供游泳方向稳定性外，可能衍生出了一些附加的功能，例如直立高耸的中背棘能使盔甲鱼在捕食者眼里具有了恐吓性，刀刃状的中背脊可能也起到一些防御的作用。南盘鱼头甲侧缘具有两对非常奇特的侧向延伸的突起；通过对这两对侧突同源性的比较，讨论了南盘鱼的潜在系统分类位置。鉴于南盘鱼奇特的形态，以及它在华南鱼目中相对较早的出现时代，建议暂时把南盘鱼放到一个单属科南盘鱼科，代表了华南鱼目早期分出来的一个支系。 ar关键词：盔甲鱼类，早泥盆世，云南曲靖，西山村组
