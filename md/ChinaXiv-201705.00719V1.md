The synergy of the activities between chloroquine and various human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors was investigated in chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive malaria parasites.In both in vitro and in vivo assay systems,ritonavir was found to be the most potent in potentiating the antimalarial action of chloroquine.

Chloroquine has been commonly used as an antimalarial drug due to its rapid onset of action,easy use,low cost,and toxicity (18).However, the resistance to chloroquine developed by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has significantlyreduced the efficacy of the drug.Many efforts have been made to restore chloroquine's eficacy,and several compounds,such as calcium channel blockers,tricyclic antidepressants,antipsychotic calmodulin antagonists,and histamine H1 receptor antagonists,have been found to be able to enhance the antimalarial action of chloroquine in resistant lines in vitro and in vivo(7).Most of these agents,however,have little intrinsic antimalarial activity and hardly enhance the sensitivity to chloroquine in sensitive lines.In addition,high doses of these agents,which could be toxic to the host and lead to systemic side effects,are required for effective synergistic activity.

Previous studies have suggested that a number of human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (HIVPIs) are activeagainstP.falciparumin vitro(1,12,15) andagainstPlasmodiumchabaudiinamurinemodel(1).Althoughthemechanism of the antimalarial activities of HIV PIs is not clear, saquinavir and ritonavir behaved synergistically with chloroquine against the chloroquine-resistant line in vitro (14).In this report, the synergistic effects of five HIVPIs,saquinavir, lopinavir,atazanavir,ritonavir,and nelfinavir,with chloroquine on both the chloroquine-sensitive clone 3D7 and the chloroquine-resistant clone Dd2 were investigated in vitro.Potentiation of chloroquine antimalarial action by HIVPIswas further studied in vivo in a rodent model of malaria.

$P$ falciparum clones were maintained continuously in blood group $\mathrm { O ^ { + } }$ human erythrocytes and $10 \%$ human serum in a gas mixture consisting of $7 \%$ （204号 $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ， $5 \% 0 _ { 2 }$ ，and $8 8 \%$ （20 $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ (16) and synchronized by serial treatments with $5 \%$ D-sorbitol (10). Drug interaction studies were performed with a modification of the fixed-ratio method as previously described (6).Parasite growth was determined by light microscopy of Giemsa-stained smears,and the percent inhibition of growth was calculated. Fractional inhibitory concentrations (2,6) were determined, and isobolograms were constructed to quantitate the interaction between HIV PIs and chloroquine.The degree of interaction was indicated by the parameter $I$ Positive values of $I$ indicate synergism,and negative values represent antagonism; addition occurs when they equal zero (2).In vivo drug interactions were measured by using a $P _ { \cdot }$ ，chabaudirodentmalaria 4-day suppressive test $( 3 , 5 )$ .Experimental groups of six female NIH mice (average body weight, ${ \sim } 2 5 \ \mathrm { g }$ ）were inoculated by intraperitoneal injection with $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ or $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ parasitized erythrocytes of the chloroquine-sensitive line ASS or the chloroquine-resistant line ASCQ,respectively.At 4,24,48,and $7 2 \mathrm { { h } }$ postinoculation, the mice were orally administered drugs. On day 4,thin blood filmswere made,and the parasitemias were determined.All experiments included a drug-free control group,a chloroquine-treated group,and groups treated with different doses of the HIVPIs administered alone or in combination with chloroquine.Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's $t$ test, and $P$ values of less than O.05 were considered significant.

Isobologram analysis showed that all HIV PIs tested were able to enhance the antimalarial action ofchloroquine $( I > 0 )$ ）, and ritonavir exerted the most synergistic action $( I = 2 . 2 3$ on chloroquine against the chloroquine-resistant clone Dd2 (Fig. 1).However,all curves following roughly the diagonal $( I \approx 0 )$ ）, except ritonavir $( I = 1 . 1 2 )$ ,were obtained with chloroquinesensitive clone 3D7,clearly evidencing simple additive effects of these combinations (Fig.1).Because ritonavir was strongly synergistic with chloroquine against both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant clones in vitro,we further examined its synergism activity by in vivo experiments.It was observed that administration of 10 to $1 6 0 \mathrm { m g }$ ritonavir per $\mathrm { k g }$ body weight alone did not affect the growth of chloroquine-resistant parasites and showed no signs of toxicity in mice.When ritonavir was coadministered with $2 . 5 \mathrm { \ m g / k g }$ chloroquine,significant parasitesuppressive effects were observed in the chloroquine-resistant clone of the parasite in comparison with the chloroquine-alone control group,and all doses of ritonavir tested showed similar levels of synergy with chloroquine (Fig.2). Oral administration

of saquinavir,atazanavir,ritonavir, or nelfinavir at $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / k g } }$ also potentiated the antimalarial action of chloroquine in resistant parasites,but the same dose of lopinavir did not restore sensitivity to chloroquine (Fig.3A). The in vivo experiment also revealed that the most efficient compound for potentiating the antimalarial action of chloroquine among these HIV PIs wasritonavir (Fig.3A).Furthermore,the synergistic effect between ritonavir and chloroquine was pronounced either in the chloroquine-sensitive line $P _ { \cdot }$ chabaudi ASS (Fig.3B) or in the resistant line ASCQ (Fig.3A). The synergy of chloroquine and ritonavir in ASS and ASCQ parasites is probably partly due to the pharmacokinetic interaction of the two drugs. The potent ability of ritonavir in inhibiting the cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway(9) could be exploited to increase or maintain the level of chloroquine in the blood.

Mutations in pfcrt( $P .$ falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter） play an important role in producing the chloroquine resistance phenotype in $P .$ falciparum.The mutations of PfCRT may alter the substrate specificity of the transporter and facilitate the diffusion of the diprotonated chloroquine from the digestive vacuole (17).Nitrogen atoms of the HIV PIs,which can be protonated in acidic environments,and the hydrophobic heterocyclic ring may play certain roles in their reversal activities in vitro.ProtonatedHIVPIs may bind to the mutated PfCRT and block the pore because of its hydrophobicity. Consequently,chloroquine is not effluxed from the digestive vacuole and may effciently reach therapeutic concen

tration to kill the parasites.Although $P _ { \ l }$ ，chabaudihasapfcrtlike gene $( p c c g l O )$ ,it is unlikely to be linked to chloroquine resistance in that species (8).Our observation that treatment of mice with the HIV PIs increased chloroquine susceptibilities in both human and rodent malaria parasite species suggests that other mechanisms may exist.It has been shown that the increased glutathione levels in resistant malaria parasite species may enable the detoxification of chloroquine in resistant parasites (4,11).HIVPIs may interfere with glutathione metabolism to increase the chloroquine sensitivity in both $P _ { \cdot }$ falciparum andP.chabaudi malaria parasite species.In addition, ritonavir may reduce glutathione levels in chloroquine-resistantand-sensitive parasites to enhance the antimalarial action of chloroquine.Further experiments are needed to determine whetherandhowHIVPIsinfluencetheintracellularlevelsof glutathione to restore sensitivity to chloroquine.

HIV PIs can directly inhibit the growth of $P$ falciparum in vitro at or below the concentrations found in human plasma after oral drug administration (1,12,15).Because HIV PIs have relatively short half-lives,it might be beneficial touse thesePIs for malaria patientswho are being treated with the long half-life chloroquine to prevent recrudescence (15).Previous studies have demonstrated that chloroquine has antiHIV effect and showed synergism with HIV PIs (13).The potential ability of chloroquine to overcome resistance to HIV PIs could be important in the treatment of drug-experienced HIV-positive subjects.Therefore,coadministration ofHIVPIs and chloroquine to HIV/malaria parasite-coinfected or singly infected individuals may enhance the eficacies of the two groups of drugs in patients.
