# Abstract

This work attmpts to find out the models which can describe the size effects in modulus and hardness of polymers measured by indentation tests.Firstlytheelastic size effectsare described bya model,through introducing a modelof elasticunloading load with consideration ofcouple stress elasticity into the Oliver-Pharrindentation approach.The accordingly proposed modulus model and hardness model agree excellently with a large amount of experimental data obtained fromliteratures.The models show that the elastic size effects of polymers and their experimental observations are mainly determined by the molecular structures.The fiting results verify that the size effects in indentation hardness of polymers with complex molecular structures are significantly elastic.Secondly,it is postulated that the plastic size effects in indentation hardness of polymers are only derived from their glassy components.A shear transformation plasticity theory proposed for glassy polymers is employed to characterize the plastic size effects. A hardness model is accordingly proposed and agrees well with related experimental data.

# 1.Introduction

Thenano-indentationapproachofOliver and Pharr[1]has been widelyused to measure modulus andhardnessofcrystals, polymeric materials or thin films.In such atest,the phenomenon that the measured modulus and hardnessincrease with decreasing indentation depthsiscalled indentationsizeeffects (simplifiedas ISEs).Forcrystals,size effcts almostdo not emerge in indentation modulus,but mainly in indentation hardnes,and have been wellstudied and mostly described by the model proposedbyNixand Gao[2].Nix and Gao found ISEs of crystalsare induced bythe different distributionof geometrically necessary dislocations along the indentation depths.For polymers，size efects are however extensively observed inboth indentation modulus andindentation hardness[3-10].But thenotionof dislocations cannotbeappliedto polymers dueto the lack of long-range order.Itisnecessary toinvestigate the essential mechanismofthe sizeeffectsof polymers,from which we may get some favorable results conducive to the development of MEMS,sensors,precision instruments.

The present work attempts to construct models whichcan describe the ISEs of polymers.The first study in this respect is the hardness model ofLam and Chong[11] which adopts the notionofthe geometrically necessary kinksofmolecular chains in polymer plasticity.This issimilar to the innovationof Nixand Gao[2] which adopts thenotionof the geometricaly necessrydislocations incrystal plasticityRecentlyHanandNikolov[12]andAlisafaei etal.3]pointed out that the size efects in indentation modulus (simplified as modulus ISEs)of polymers are only elastic size ffects, becausethe determinations of modulus in indentation tests are only related to elastic deformations.They also suggested the size ffects in identation hardness(simplifiedas hardnes ISEs)of polymers can be decomposed into elastic part and plastic part,and the elastic part probablyeven be dominant due to theextensive elasticityof polymers.In order to theoreticallcharacterize theISEs ofpolymers,Hanand Nikolov[12]simplified the indentation problemasthe Boussinesq problem.Thecouple stress elasticity is introduced into the simplified problemand a hardnessmodel is accordingly proposed.Both the model of Lamand Chong[11]and that of Han and Nikolov[12] involve rotation gradients in deformations of microstructures. Voyiadjis et al.[10] suggested that the size effects of polymers maybe at least partly independent ofrotation gradients,since size efects were also found in rotation-free situations such as uniaxial tensile experiments ofpolymeric nanofibers.Theyaccordingly proposedahardnessmodel,byemployingashear transformation plasticity theory of glassy polymers which was developed by Voyiadjis and Samadi-Dooki [14].

The present work is an extension of the works of Han and Nikolov[12]and Voyiadjis et al.[10].Before we attempted to solve the spherical contact problem in thecontext of couple stress elasticity anumber of solutions regarding the same problem have beenreported[15-18].Basedon these works,similar to the work of Han and Nikolov[12],the couple stress elasticity was introduced into Hertz contact problem,and a theoretical model ofcontactload whichcan characterize the size effects incontact testsof elastomers wasderived[19]inour previous work.In Section 2,theOliver-Pharrindentation approach is firstly recalld.Then the proposed load model is introduced into Oliver-harr approach.Accordingly,two models respectively characterizing the modulus ISEs and the elastic hardness ISEs are derived.These two models are applied toalarge number of experimental data toillustrate their validity.In Section 3,the shear transformation plasticity theoryandhardness modelrespectivelyproposedbyVoyiadjisandSamadi-Dooki[14]and Voyiadjis etal.[10]arerecalled. Anewhardnessmodel withlessassumptions andinasimpler form is proposed,inordertocharacterize theplastichardness ISEs of polymers. The proposed hardness mode is compared with related experimental data.

# 2. Model for the elastic indentation size effects of polymers

# 2.1. Model development

We start by recaling the indentation approach proposed by Oliver and Pharr[1].Their approach adopts a diamond Berkovich indenter. A single indentation cycle contains three periods: loading to a peak load $P _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ , as shown in Fig. 1(a); holding for a period of time at the peak load; unloading from the peak load to zero with a plastically residual depth $h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ being left,as shown inFig.1(b).The holding period is conducted in order to minimize any non-elastic eects upon unloading period, assuring a completely elastic deformation with respect to $h - h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ . Fig.1(c) shows a typical load-curve of a single indentation cycle. Three important quantities are recorded: the maximum deformation depth $h _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ ， the peak load $P _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ and the plastically residual depth $h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ ：

Fig.1.(a)The Berkovich indenter is pressed into the sample and holding it fora period of time; (b) Unloading the indenter at the contact depth $h _ { \mathrm { c } }$ and the maximum deformation depth $h _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ ; After unloading, a residual depth $h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ and an impresion with convex curvature are left on the surface; (c)The loading and unloading curves of a single indentation cycle,i whichtheedlineschematicallilustrates thecontactstifessthatisdefinedas theslopeoftheinitialportions of the unloading curve.

Oliver-Pharrapproach starts with theelasticcontact analysis atthe initial unloading stages.They found that the elastic unloading curve can be best fitted by a power law relation:

$$
P = \alpha ( h - h _ { \mathrm { f } } ) ^ { m } ,
$$

where $P$ is the elastic contact load at the unloading stage, $\alpha$ and $m$ are fitted parameters and $h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ is exactly the plastic residue.The critical property estimated from the unloading curve is the elasticcontact stifess at initial unloading stages, which is defined as

$$
S = \frac { d P } { d h } \bigg | _ { h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } } .
$$

The contact depth $h _ { \mathrm { c } }$ shown in Fig.l(a) is then estimated by

$$
h _ { \mathrm { c } } = h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } - 0 . 7 5 \frac { P _ { \mathrm { m a x } } } { S } .
$$

The projected area of elastic contact shown in Fig. l(a) is determined by substituting $h _ { \mathrm { c } }$ into the area function of the cross section of indenter, i.e.,

$$
A _ { \mathrm { c } } = 2 4 . 5 h _ { \mathrm { c } } ^ { 2 }
$$

and the elastic modulus is related to $A _ { \mathrm { c } }$ by

$$
E = \frac { \sqrt { \pi } ( 1 - \nu ^ { 2 } ) } { 2 } \frac { 1 } { \beta _ { \circ } } \frac { S } { \sqrt { A _ { \mathrm { c } } } } ,
$$

where $\beta _ { 0 }$ is a dimensionless parameter accounting for indenter geometry. Finally, the hardness is determined by

$$
H = \frac { P _ { \mathrm { m a x } } } { A _ { \mathrm { c } } } .
$$

The critical advance in Oliver-Phar approach is their understanding of the effectivebehaviorof Berkovich indenterat the initial unloading stages.Firstly,on the basisofalarge numberof experimental observations,they foundtheelastic unloading curves at the initial stages can be exactly represented by Eq.(1), in which the values of $m$ are around 1.5. The contactloadoflinear elastic half space byarigid paraboloid ofrevolution has been analytically expressed bySnedon[20] as a power law with the exponent being exact 1.5.Therefore, Oliver and Pharr suggested the effective behavior of the Berkovich indenter in contact withthe elastic recovery of deformed surface can be approximated by the behavior of a paraboloid ofrevolution in contact with the flatsurface of half space,asschematicallyshown inFig.2.Further,on the basis ofseveral finiteelementsimulations,Pharr andBolshakov[21]verified this inferenceand constructedtheconceptof "effective indenter shape.

Fig.2. (a)A Berkovich indenter in contact with the elastic recovery of a plastic impression; (b)A paraboloid of revolution in contact with the flat surface of elastic half space.

In Sneddon's work,the contact load of linear elastic half space bya rigid paraboloid ofrevolution is expressed as

$$
P _ { 0 } = \frac { 8 \mu \sqrt { R } } { 3 ( 1 - \nu ) } h _ { \mathrm { e } } ^ { \frac { 3 } { 2 } }
$$

where $P _ { 0 }$ is the linear elastic contact load, $\mu$ is the shear modulus of half space, $R$ is the curvature radius of indenter tip, $\nu$ is Poisson ratio, $h _ { \mathrm { e } }$ is the normal displacement ofthe contact center.In the limit ofsmall displacement, this contact problem is the same as the contact ofhalf spacebyarigid sphere, which is also the famous Hertz contact problem [22].

Recently,we investigatedthe Hertzcontact problem in thecontext ofcouple stress elasticity[19].Amodel ofcontact load with consideration of couple stress effects is analytically derived and expressed as

$$
P = P _ { 0 } \Bigg [ 1 { + } \frac { 3 ( 1 { - } \nu ) l ^ { 2 } } { 2 R h _ { \mathrm { e } } } \Bigg ] .
$$

where $P$ is the couple stress-based contact load, $l$ is a characteristic length of deformation body employed in couple stresselasticitytocharacterizesize-dependentdeformations,smilartothetwoLaméconstants in clasical lnear elasticity. It can be seen from Eq.(8) that the couple stress-based contact load $P$ contains an augmenting term relative to the linear elastic contact load $P _ { 0 }$ . Besides, the augmenting effects increase with the decreasing deformation depth $h _ { \mathrm { e } }$ , which denotes the size efects existing in contact load.Furthermore,this equation has been successfully used to characterizethe size effects found in spherical contact test of PDMS [23].

The above discusion indicates the modulus ISEs and the elastic part of hardness ISEs may be theoretically modeled by introducing thecouple stres-ased elasticcontact formulaEq.(8)intoteOliver-PharrindentationapproachSpecificaly the elasticcontactloadat theinitialunloadingstages,i.e,Eq.(),maybedecomposed intotwoparts: ainearelasticload andacorrespondingaugment mediatedbycouple stresseffects,similar toEq.(8).For simplicitythe linear elasticpartin Eq. (1) is assumed to be in the same analytical form as Eq. (7), with the exponent $m$ in Eq. (1) being sustained. Besides, the couple stress-mediated load augment is assumed to be the same as that in Eq. (8), i.e., $4 \mu l ^ { 2 } ( h - h _ { \mathrm { f } } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } / \sqrt { R }$ . Based on these considerations, the couple stress-based unloading curve can be expressed as

$$
P = \frac { 8 \mu \sqrt { R } } { 3 ( 1 - \nu ) } ( h - h _ { \mathrm { f } } ) ^ { m } \left[ 1 + \frac { 3 ( 1 - \nu ) l ^ { 2 } } { 2 R { ( h - h _ { \mathrm { f } } ) } ^ { m - \frac { 1 } { 2 } } } \right] .
$$

Incorporating Eq.(9) into Eq. (2), the couple stress-based contact stiffness can be expressed as

$$
S = S _ { 0 } \left[ 1 + \frac { 3 ( 1 - \nu ) l ^ { 2 } } { 4 m R { ( h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } - h _ { \mathrm { f } } ) } ^ { m - \frac { 1 } { 2 } } } \right] ,
$$

where $S _ { 0 }$ is the linear elastic contact stiffness, which is obtained by incorporating the leading term inEq.(9)into Eq. (2), and expressed as

$$
S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = \frac { 8 m \mu \sqrt { R } ( h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } - h _ { \mathrm { f } } ) ^ { m - 1 } } { 3 ( 1 - \nu ) } .
$$

According to Eq. (5), the size effects in modulus can only come from $S$ and $A _ { \mathrm { { c } } }$ ,because other parameters in Eq. (5) are prescribed constants.Eq.(1O) has introduced the size effects versus $h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } - h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ into $S$ . Similarly, the size effects could be introduced into $A _ { \mathrm { c } }$ by incorporating Eq. (9) and Eq. (10) into Eq. (3). However, the respective size effects in $P$ and （204号 $S$ may be largely “faded” after they are incorporated into the term $P / S$ ，due to the quotient form of this term. Additionally, this incorporation would make the expression of the resultant model of $A _ { \mathrm { c } }$ much complex.Based on these considerations,for simplicity the size effects in $A _ { \mathrm { c } }$ are neglected here. Therefore, the size effects in modulus are modeled by directly incorporating Eq. (10) into Eq. (5), and expressed as

$$
E = E _ { \mathrm { { 0 } } } \left[ 1 + \frac { 3 ( 1 - \nu ) l ^ { 2 } } { 4 m R { ( h _ { \mathrm { { m a x } } } - h _ { \mathrm { { f } } } ) } ^ { \zeta - \frac { 1 } { 2 } } } \right] ,
$$

where $E _ { 0 }$ is the linear elastic indentation modulus,which is obtained by incorporating Eq.(11) into Eq. (5).

Eq.(12)describes the modulus ISEs as that the modulus Varies with the completely elastic depth $h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } - h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ . However, in an indentation test, the measured modulus and hardness are recorded as a function of $h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ . Therefore, in order to apply Eq. (12) to the experimentally obtained moduli, it should be also expressed as a function of $h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ . In the indentation tests of UHMWPE,PS and PMMA[3]andPAI[7], the fractionof elastic deformation work (thearea encompassed by CDE in Fig.l(c) in total deformation work (the area encompassdby ABCE inFig.1(c)) is found to approximately remain constant as $h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ increases, as can be seen in Fig.3.Therefore, for simplicity we assume that the elastic recovery $h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } - h _ { \mathrm { f } }$ （204号 is related to $h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ by a relation: $( h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } - h _ { \mathrm { f } } ) / h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } = \eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ ， where the constant $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ essentially denotes the fraction of elastic depth, ranging from O to 1. Based on these approximations, we can express Eq. (12) in the form of

$$
E = E _ { \mathrm { { 0 } } } \left[ 1 + \frac { l _ { \mathrm { R } } } { 2 m h _ { \mathrm { \operatorname* { m a x } } } ^ { m - \frac { 1 } { 2 } } } \right] ,
$$

where the relevant parameters are combined into a higher-order parameter $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ by

$$
{ l _ { \mathrm { { R } } } } = \frac { 3 ( 1 - \nu ) { l ^ { 2 } } } { 2 { R { \eta _ { \mathrm { { e } } } } ^ { m - { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } } } } .
$$

As the constant fraction $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ is dimensionless, the higher-order parameter $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ has a dimension of length． So far, the modulus ISEs have been characterized by the exponent $m$ and the higher-order parameter $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ ． According to the understanding of efective behavior of indenter in the work of Oliver and Pharr[1],the theoretical range of $m$ is considered to be around 1.5,at most ranging from 1 to 2. In a difference to $m$ , to determine the theoretical range of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ is of difficulties, because $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ contains five pieces of information, either from the material itself or from the indenter.

Fig.3.The fraction of elastic deformation Work in total deformation work of UHMWPE,PSand PMMA[3]and PAI[7]. As mentioned in Section 1,Hanand Nikolov[12]and Alisafaei et al.[13] pointed out the hardness ISEs of polymers can be decomposed into elastic part and plastic part,andthe elastic part mayeven be dominant.Iftheplastic hardness ISEs are temporarily neglected here,the elastic partcan be similarly modeledby incorporating the couple stres-based elastic contact load,i.e.,Eq.(9), into the hardness formula Eq.(6). Therefore,we can obtain

$$
H = H _ { \mathrm { 0 } } \left[ 1 + \frac { l _ { \mathrm { R } } } { h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } ^ { m - \frac { 1 } { 2 } } } \right] ,
$$

where $H _ { 0 }$ represents the macro hardness or constant hardness, which is obtained by substituting linear elastic contact load (the leading term in Eq. (9)) into Eq. (6) with $h$ being $h _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ . The parameters $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ are exactly those in Eq (13).However,itshouldbenoted that if this hardnesmodel is directlyappliedtothe experimental dataof indentation hardness of a polymer, the estimated values of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ may respectively deviate from those estimated by Eq. (13), because the plastic hardnes ISEs in experimental data may be non-negligible and even significant.The same values as those estimated byEq.(13)can be obtained onlyif the plastic hardnes ISEsof this polymer canbe extremely negligible. Sofar,the modulus ISEsand the elastic hardnes ISEs are respectively modeledbyEq.(13)andEq.(15).Itcanbe found fromEq.(13)andEq. (15)thatarelation exists between the twoaugmenting effct terms in the two models, which can be expressed as

$$
\frac { H - H _ { \mathrm { 0 } } } { H _ { \mathrm { 0 } } } = 2 m \Biggl ( \frac { E - E _ { \mathrm { 0 } } } { E _ { \mathrm { 0 } } } \Biggr ) .
$$

As mentioned above, if the plastic hardness ISEs of a polymer can be extremely negligible,the values of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ estimated byEq.(13)willbethesameas thoseestimatedbyEq. (15).Underthiscondition,if theexperimentallyobtained hardness and moduli are respectively processed in the form of Eq. (16) and plotted in a form versus $1 / { h _ { \mathrm { { m a x } } } }$ , two power law curves with uniform exponent $m - 0 . 5$ will be obtained. In particular, these two curves become two straight lines if the values of $m$ are uniformly estimated as 1.5, which requires the“effective indenter shape”in tests is equivalent to ad paraboloid ofrevolution.Additionaly,there isa proportional relationshipof3 times betwee the slopes ofte two lines.

# 2.2.Model verification

The scattering points in Fig. 4 are experimentallyobtained indentation moduli of various glassy polymers including PS (Briscoe etal.3]),PMMA(Briscoeetal.[3]; Voyiadjis etal.10]),Epoxy(Alisafaeietal.[8]),andvarioussemi-cylli polymers including Nylon66 (Shen etal. [6]), UHMWPE (Briscoe et al.[3]),PTFE (Li and Bhushan [24]) and LDPE (Tavares etal.[5]).Fig.5(a-d)coespondinglyshows theindentationhadness ofthesepolymers.Inaddition,Fig5(e-f) shows the indentation hardnessof Epoxy(Chong andLam[4]),PC(Chong andLam[4]; Samadi-Dooki etal.[9]) and PAI (Tatiraju et al.[7J).Themoduli of polymers shown inFig.5(e-f) were not measured in therespective literatures.Itcan be sen from these two figuresthatforPS,PMMA,Epoxy (Alisafaei etal.[8]),Nylon66 andLDPE the hardness ISEsare always acompanied by the modulus ISEs,while for UHMWPE and PTFE the ISEs arise in neither modulus nor hardness. In other words,for these polymers, ISEs must arise in hardnessas long as it arises in modulus,or vice versa.

In order to ilustrate thevalidityofEq.(13)andEq. (15)forcharacterizing ISEsof polymers,theyarerespectivelyfited tothe experimental data with sizeeffects shown inFig.4andFig.5.As shown inthetwo figures,an excellentagreement between the two modelsand the experimental data of polymers other than Epoxy(Alisafaei et al.[8]) isobtained.For Epoxy(Alisafaei etal.[8]),bothEq.(13)andEq.(15)slightlydeviate from the experimental data after depths of about （20 $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , i.e., larger $E _ { 0 }$ and $H _ { 0 }$ are predicted. This may be attributed to the continuous declines of experimental data at these depths, due to the possible inhomogeneity of properties derived from sample preparation.

The fitted values of $\mathit { \Delta } E _ { 0 } , \ l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are shown in Table 1 and Table 2,respectively. It can be seen that all $m$ values in Table 1 are in the theoretical range of $m$ . Specially, the $m$ values of PS and PMMA (Briscoe et al. [3])are significantlycloseto1.5,which implies that the“effctive indentershape”used inthese experiments can be well identified as a paraboloid of revolution.Additionally, in Table 1 the $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ value of LDPE is larger than those of other polymers.Comparing Table2 with Table 1,it can be found that for polymers whose modulus and hardness are measured, the values of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ in Table 2 are respectively greater than those in Table 1. Especially, in Table 2 the $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ of PAI reaches about $5 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and that of LDPE can even reach near $9 0 0 0 0 { \mathrm { n m } }$ . The $m$ value of LDPE in Table 2 can even reach 2.9 which significantly deviates from the theoretical range of $m$ ：

# 2.3Discussion

Before proceeding to the discussion ofresults in Table1 and Table2,letus discussthe influences of characteristic length $l$ and elastoplastic properties of polymers on $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ , because these features of different polymers are significantly discrepant. Regarding to the characteristic length $l$ of polymers,Nikolov et al.[25] and Han [26] have studied its physical mechanisms and related itto the bending stifness of polymeric chains.The phenomenological rotation gradient energy incouple stress elasticity is related by Nikolov et al. [25]to the Frank elasticity energy, which is always present as long as the chains possess finite bending stiffess and neighboring interactions. They worked out a relation: $K = 3 \mu l ^ { 2 }$ linking the phenomenological characteristic length l to the effective Frank elasticity constant $K$ . Han [26] subsequently illustrated in detail the dependence of characteristic length $l$ on the molecular bending stiffess,although the exact lvalue ofeach polymer is not estimated.Theyfoundthat polymers containing complex molecular structures in chains always have larger characteristic length $l$ than those having flexible chains.For example, PAI, Epoxy, PC and PS have the longest $l$ due to the stiffening of aromatic rings in the backbone or side group; PMMA and Nylon66 have shorter $l$ ， since PMMA has complex side groups and the Nylon66 has stiff areas of chains due to the presence of the O and $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ atoms [12], although they both lack aromatic rings; UHMWPE and PTFE have shortest l which can even be close to $0 \mathrm { n m }$ due to their highly flexible and linear chains.LDPE was not considered in the work of Han [26].The $l$ ofLDPE is presently considered to be longer than those of UHMWPE and PTFE due to its easily branched chains,but shorter than those of other polymers due to the flexibility of chains.

The elastoplastic properties of polymers mainly influence the parameter $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ which denotes the fraction of elastic recovery intotal elastoplasticdeformation depth. In general, polymers with higher cros-link/entanglementdensity can provide higher elastic resistance than those containing flexible chains,because the flexible chains can easily adjustthemselves to plastically dissipate the indentation work [26].This kind of dependence is approximately consistent with the dependence of characteristic length $l$ on the molecular bending stiffness. As can be seen in Fig. 3,the fraction of elastic work of PAI is larger than those of other polymers,and the corrsponding fraction of UHMWPE is the lowest. According to the definition of $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ in Section 2.1, it can be postulated that the parameter （20 $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ also approximately conforms the size sequence of molecular stiffess. Additionally,the results of finite element simulations for a variety of elastic to plastic materials [21] show that the exponent $m$ obviously increases with decreasing $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ . Furthermore, according to the analytical solutions of Sneddon [2O], the increasing $m$ implies that the effective shape of indenter is close to a cone, resulting in a smaller effective curvature radius $R$ ：

The $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ values in Table l are consistent with the above considerations.According to the mathematic form of Eq. (14), the $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ increases with increasing $l$ , however decreases with increasing $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ . This is the reason why the （20 $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ values in Table 1 do not strictly conform the size sequence of l.For example,the PS and Epoxycontaining rigid aromatic rings in chains should theoretically have the largest $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ than other polymers, but their $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ value may also be the largest, thus the resulted $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ value is not the largest one. For LDPE, if its $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ value is considered to be close to that of UHMWPE, it also has the lowest $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ value. According to the finite element simulations of Pharr and Bolshakov [21] mentioned above, its lowest $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ causes the largest $m$ value among these polymers. More importantly, the lowest $\eta _ { \mathrm { e } }$ and the largest $m$ of LDPE, along with the correspondingly smaller effective curvature radius $R$ , make the resulted $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ value the largest among these polymers,although the LDPE has a shorter $l$ than them.Conclusively, with these considerations,theresults shown inFig.4and Table1 demonstrate thatthe modulus model Eq. (13) can be successfully applied to characterize the modulus ISEs of polymers.

The corresponding deviations between the values of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ in Table 2 and those in Table 1 can be attributed to the discrepancy that the experimentally obtained hardnes ISEs contain both elastic part and plastic part, while Eq. (15)considers only the elastic part.As discussd above,the plastic disspation ofLDPE in indentation is significant dueto its relatively flexible chains,thus the plastic hardnessISEs ofLDPE may even be dominant.This is exactly the reason why the values of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ of LDPE significantly deviate from those predicted by Eq. (13),and from the theoreticalrange.For other polymers in Table1,the fraction of plastic deformation is smaler than thatof LDPE, thus the plastic hardness ISEs are slighter than those ofLDPE.Therefore,the corresponding deviations are not as significant as thatofLDPE.Itcan even be postulated that for all polymers shown inFig.5,if the elastic hardness ISEs can be separated from the experimental data and fitted by Eq. (15), the same values of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ as those predictedbyEq.(13)willbeobtained.Thatis tosay,despite these deviations,thehardness model Eq.(15)can stil be applied to characterize the elastic hardness ISEs.In particular,the PAI has the lowest fraction of plastic deformation among allpolymers.Therefore,the plastic hardness ISEs of PAI may be trivial.If its modulus data are

obtained by experiment and fited by Eq. (13), the same values of $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ and $m$ as their counterparts (estimated by Eq.   
(15)) in Table 2 will be obtained.

The influences ofthe plastic hardness ISEs can alsobe explicitly reflected by relation Eq. (16).For each polymer depicted in Fig. 4, the $( E - E _ { 0 } ) / E _ { 0 }$ values where $E _ { 0 }$ comes from Table 1 are plotted versus $1 / { h _ { \mathrm { { m a x } } } }$ in Fig. 6. The corresponding $( H - H _ { 0 } ) / H _ { 0 }$ values where $H _ { 0 }$ comes from Table 2 are also plotted. According to the discussion of Eq. (16) in Section 2.1, for each polymer whose $m$ values in both Table 1 and Table 2 are uniformly close to 1.5, the data points of either $\left( H - H _ { 0 } \right) / H _ { 0 }$ or $( E - E _ { 0 } ) / E _ { 0 }$ will line up more straightly. Additionally, a triple relation will exist between the slopes ofthe two linear trends.For a more explicit comparison,a straight line passing through the point $( 0 , \ 0 )$ is respectively fited to these data points. As can be seen in Fig. 6, this kind of tendency is approximately reflected by the data points of PS,PMMA, and Nylon66.As deviant $E _ { 0 }$ and $H _ { 0 }$ values are predicted forEpoxy(Alisafaei etal.[8]) inFig.4andFig.5,its data points inFig.6 slightlydeviate fromthe liear tendency.However,it can be found that the data pointsof LDPE significantly deviate the linear trend.The corresponding slopes of these linearly fiting are shown in Table 3.Ascanbe seen therein,for PS,PMMA and Nylon66,the triple relation is obvious.However,forLDPE the relation inslopes significantlydeviates from the triple relation,whichcanbe exactlyatributedto the significant fractionof plastic hardnessISEs.Finally,it is noted that the linear fits in Fig. 6are adopted to illustrate not the validities ofEq.(13) andEq. (15) (both for choice $m \ = 1 . 5 )$ ’ but the influence of plastic hardness ISEs on the validities of the two models.

Allresults present above indicate that for polymers shown in Fig.5 other than LDPE,the hardnessISEs are significantly elastic, while the hardnessISEs ofLDPE are significantly plastic.Additionally, these results yield he presentiment that if the plastic hardness ISEsare to be characterizedby a model,this model may be ina similar mathematical form to Eq. (15), but with an exponent larger than $m - 0 . 5$ . Firstly, as can be seen in Fig. 5,although the experimentally obtained hardness ofallpolymers have already contained plastic ISEs,the mathematical formof Eq.(15)can still give an exact graphical description of the whole hardnes ISEs.This implies the plastic hardness ISEs can alsobe describedbya formula in thesimilar formtoEq.(15),i.e.,the augmenting effectterm is proportional to the power of $1 / { h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } }$ . Secondly,for polymers whose moduli are also measured, the $m$ value estimated by the Eq. (15) is respectively larger than those estimated bythe modulus model Eq. (13).This implies thatthecoresponding exponent in plastic hardness ISEs will be larger than $m - 0 . 5$ . According to the fitted results of LDPE, this exponent maybe larger than 2.4.Thirdly,this inference is compatible with a categorization of the hardness ISEs suggested by Han (2010), which says that for a polymer the depth range presenting elastic hardness ISEs is always larger than that presenting the ISEs mediated by other factors. It can be easily seen from Eq.(15) that as the exponent $m - 0 . 5$ （20 becomes larger, the augmenting term willbecome smaller at the depths beyond $m - 0 . 5 \sqrt { l _ { \mathrm { R } } }$ ， and larger at the depths within $m { - } 0 . 5 \sqrt { l _ { \mathrm { R } } }$ . That is to say, at the depths beyond $m { - } 0 . 5 \sqrt { l _ { \mathrm { R } } }$ the elastic hardness ISEs will be more obvious than the plastic hardness ISEs,and consequently more easily observed by experiments.

Finaly, the non-existence of hardness ISEs of UHMWPE and PTFE yields the presentiment that the plastic hardness ISEs of semi-crystalline polymers may be derived from only their glassy components,but not their crystal components.In indentation,the plastic deformation zone is onlythe region beneath the indenter.In semi-crystaline polymers,the deformations begin with the elastic and subsequently plastic deformations of glassy components [27]. In alocal region,after glasy components are exhausted,the deformations are transferredto the crystalcomponents by various crystallgraphic processes up to large plastic strains.UHMWPE and PTFE have the highest degree of crystalinitydue to their highly linear chains,thus their plastic deformations beneath the indenter are mainlyderived from crystal components.However,as can be seen fromFig.5,both UHMWPE and PTFE exhibit no hardness ISEs. This indicates that the plastic deformation of their crystal components mediates no size effect. Itcanbe postulated that for semi-crystalline Nylon66 and LDPE,the plastic deformation of crystal components mayalso mediate no size effect,and thus their plastic hardness ISEs are only related to glassy components.

# 3.Models for the plastic indentation size effects of polymers

This section attmpts to model the plastic hardness ISEs of polymers.Studies in this respect mainly involve incorporating size characteristic into the formula of plastic deformation.Lam and Chong [11] developed a strain gradient plasticity theory anda coresponding hardness model,basedon the molecular kink pair theory of Argon[28] in whichthecarrierof plasticityis the formationof kink pairs.Their hardness model,similar to thatofNixand Gao [2] for crystals,employs the notion of statistically random kinks and geometrically necessary kinks of chains. However,inArgon's plasticitytheoryfor glassypolymers,thecarrierofplasticity has beenreplacedbythe nucleation of shear transformations (STs)[29,14,10] which was originally proposed by Argon for glasy metals[30,31].The STs represent the cooperative rearrangements of atoms inside some free volume sites under the enforcing of shear stress,ncluding gliding,slipping,or shear rotation of the chains.The massive nucleation of shear transformation events results in the stable plastic flowof glassy metals.Based on the notion of STs,a plastic constitutive formula was developed by Voyiadjis and Samadi-Dooki [14] for PMMA.Their constitutive formula shows its success in not onlycapturing the primary softening behavior, but also justifying the secondary hardening observed in compressive experiments of PMMA. Voyiadjis et al.[10] subsequently interpreted the ISEs of glasy polymers as that the probability of nucleating STs with average size,at the very smallindentation depths,is lower than that at deep indentation depths,and consequently, higher shear stresses arecaused.This probabilistic interpretation of ISEs provides a novel insight to understand the plastic ISEs of polymers.

# 3.1.Model development

The constitutive formula of Voyiadjis and Samadi-Dooki [14] is briefly recalled here.In unstressed state,a large amount offree volume sites with diferent sizes are distributed in the microstructure due to the amorphous nature of glassy polymers.Among these free volume sites,those with excessive free volume are more likely to foster atomic STs under enforcing ofshear stress,as showninFig.7.These sites withexcesive free volume are alsocalled potential transformation sites,which are only a fraction of allfree volume sites.It is noted that the STs are not any existing defects but dynamic events only instantaneously nucleating under enforcing of shear stres.Those potential transformation sites where the ST events are occurring are called shear transformation zones (STZs)(see Fig.7).The STZs have a characteristic average volume $\Omega$ and a characteristic shear strain $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { { T } } }$ ：

The constitutive relation between the global shear strain rate $\dot { \gamma } ^ { P }$ and global shear yield stress $\tau$ is expressed as

$$
\dot { \gamma } ^ { P } = \dot { \gamma } _ { \mathrm { 0 } } ^ { P } c _ { \mathrm { f } } \exp \left( \frac { - \Delta F } { k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } \right) \sinh \left( \frac { \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } \Omega \tau } { 2 k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } \right) , \qquad 
$$

where $k _ { \mathrm { B } }$ is Boltzmann constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, the pre-exponential $\dot { \gamma } _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } ^ { \scriptscriptstyle P }$ can be calculated by $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { { r } } } \nu _ { \mathrm { { G } } }$ with $\nu _ { \mathrm { G } }$ being the frequency of atomic vibration ( $\sim$ Debye frequency) in the range of $1 0 ^ { 1 0 } { \mathrm { s } } ^ { - 1 }$ ， $\Delta F$ is the average nucleating energy of STs, and $c _ { \mathrm { f } }$ is a factor depending on the volume fraction of potential transformation sites. The average nucleating energy of STs with shear strain of $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { { T } } }$ and average volume of $\Omega$ , is considered equal to the deformation energy in the inclusion model of Eshelby [32] and expressed as

$$
\Delta F = f ( \nu , \beta ) \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } ) ^ { 2 } \Omega ,
$$

where $\mu$ is the shear modulus,and $f ( \nu , \beta )$ accounts for shear and dilatational components of the transformation strain tensor.For polymers with the Poisson's ratio of O.35-0.4, $f ( \ v { v } , \beta )$ has a value close to O.5[14, 10].

Fig.7.The representative free volume sites in glassy polymers and the corresponding shear transformation events nucleated inside some sites.

Voyiadjis et al.[10] subsequently interpreted the indentation size efects of glassy polymers based on the above constitutive formula.They suggested that the nucleation of STs in the deformation zone beneath the indenter is a probabilistic phenomenon. Onone hand,the size of a unit potential transformation site could be manifested as a spherical region with a diameter of about $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ， on the other hand, the potential transformation sites are only a fraction ofallfree volume sitesand discretelydistributed in the material.Therefore,at verysmallidentationdepths, the deformation zone is not big enoughto“see”a potentialtransformation site,andthus atoms inthis zone canhardly rearrange themselves (shear transformation) to disspate the indentation work,as schematically in Fig. 8(a), consequently the corresponding deformation zone is highly stressed.As the indenter continues to move down, the region around the highly stressed zone starts to “see" potential transformation sites and form ST events (Fig. 8(b)). At ery deep indentation depths,the ST events could massively nucleate and control the kinetics ofdeformation(Fig. 8(c)).

Fig.8.The diagram for the distribution of shear transformation zones along the indentation depth.

They suggested thatthe total shear stressin the whole deformation zone can be decomposed into two parts. One is the shear stressassociated with nucleation ofa single ST,the other is the shear stress associated with the plastic deformation of the highly stressed region, respectively denoted as $\tau _ { \scriptscriptstyle \mathrm { S T } }$ and $\tau _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } }$ . The $\tau _ { \scriptscriptstyle \mathrm { S T } }$ is derived from Eq. (17) where the parameter $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { { T } } } \varOmega \tau$ is considered to be far larger than the unit thermal activation energy $k _ { \mathrm { B } } T$ for polymers at temperatures below their glass transition, and the fraction parameter $c _ { \mathrm { f } }$ is set to 0.5. Then the $\tau _ { \mathrm { { s r } } }$ is expressed as

$$
\tau _ { \scriptscriptstyle \mathrm { S T } } = \frac { 2 k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } { \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } \Omega } \Bigg [ \ln \left( \frac { 4 \dot { \gamma } ^ { P } } { \dot { \gamma } _ { 0 } ^ { P } } \right) + \frac { \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } ) ^ { 2 } \Omega f ( \nu , \beta ) } { k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } \Bigg ] .
$$

The $\tau _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } }$ is obtained by directly setting $\Omega$ in Eq.(19) to the size of the plastic deformation zone. The plastic deformation zone is assmed to be the hemisphere under the indenter with subtracting the volume of the pyramidal indenter itself. Its size is identified to be $1 6 4 h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } ^ { 3 }$ ，

The total shear stressis expressed in a statistical form of the above stresscomponents.To this end,they extended the fraction parameter $c _ { \mathrm { f } }$ to the probability of the nucleation ofSTs and also the probability of $\tau _ { \mathrm { S T } }$ in the statistical form. This probability is specifically expressed as

$$
c _ { \mathrm { e } } = \exp ( \frac { - k \Omega } { h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } ^ { 3 } } ) ,
$$

where $k$ is a dimensionless fiting parameter, accounting for indenter geometry, proportionality and free volume fraction. As can be seen in Eq. (2O),the probability quantitatively decreases with the decreasing indentation depths. As the indentationis implemented at deeper depths,the probability increases and has an upper limit of1,representing the massive nucleation of STs. With this probability, they expressed the total shear stress as

$$
\tau _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } } = c _ { \mathrm { f } } \tau _ { \mathrm { S T } } + ( 1 - c _ { \mathrm { f } } ) \tau _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } .
$$

Then the hardness model is expressed by Voyiadjis et al.[10] as

$$
H = \frac { 1 3 . 2 k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } { \gamma ^ { \mathrm { r } } } \Bigg [ \frac { c _ { \mathrm { f } } } { \Omega } \Bigg ( \ln \left( \frac { 4 \gamma ^ { \mathrm { r } } } { \dot { \gamma } _ { \mathrm { o } } ^ { \mathrm { r } } } \right) + \frac { \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { r } } ) ^ { 2 } \Omega f ( \nu , \beta ) } { k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } \Bigg ) + \frac { 1 - c _ { \mathrm { f } } } { 1 6 4 h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } ^ { 3 } } \Bigg ( \ln \left( \frac { 4 \dot { \gamma } ^ { \mathrm { r } } } { \dot { \gamma } _ { \mathrm { o } } ^ { \mathrm { p } } } \right) + \frac { 1 6 4 h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } ^ { 3 } \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { r } } ) ^ { 2 } f ( \nu , \beta ) } { k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } \Bigg ) \Bigg ] ,
$$

where the relation $H = 6 . 6 \tau _ { \mathrm { t o t a l } }$ [33] for polymers is considered, similar to Tabor's relation [34] for metals.

However, the hardness model Eq. (22) is too complex for application. Additionally, the estimation of $\tau _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } }$ (the non-ST mediated stress),i.e., directly substituting the size of a STZ in $\tau _ { \mathrm { { s r } } }$ for the size of the whole deformation Zone, needs more rationalities.A size efect model can be directly derived from the constitutive formula Eq.(17), because Eq. (17) itself has already contained the probability parameter, or presently called size effect factor $c _ { \mathrm { f } }$ ： Similarly, considering that the parameter $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { { T } } } \Omega \tau$ is far larger than $k _ { \mathrm { B } } T$ , Eq. (17) can be converted to

$$
\tau = \frac { 2 k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } { \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } \Omega } \Bigg [ \ln \left( \frac { 2 \dot { \gamma } ^ { P } } { \dot { \gamma } _ { 0 } ^ { P } } \right) + \frac { \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } ) ^ { 2 } \Omega f ( \nu , \beta ) } { k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } + \frac { k \Omega } { h _ { \mathrm { m a x } } ^ { 3 } } \Bigg ] .
$$

Itcanbe seen thatthe indentation sizehasbeensuccessfully introduced into the constitutive formula.With therelation $H = 6 . 6 \tau$ [33]a hardness model can be expressed as

$$
H = \frac { 1 3 . 2 k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } { \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } \Omega } \left[ \ln \left( \frac { 2 \dot { \gamma } ^ { P } } { \dot { \gamma } _ { 0 } ^ { P } } \right) + \frac { \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { \scriptscriptstyle T } } ) ^ { 2 } \Omega f ( \nu , \beta ) } { k _ { \mathrm { \scriptscriptstyle B } } T } \right] + \frac { 1 3 . 2 k _ { \mathrm { \scriptscriptstyle B } } k T } { \gamma ^ { \mathrm { \scriptscriptstyle T } } h _ { \mathrm { \scriptscriptstyle m a x } } ^ { 3 } } ,
$$

where the last term denotes the STs plasticity mediated hardness ISEs.When the indentation is implemented at far deper depths,the STs are massively nucleated and the hardness augment tends to be O. It can be seen that Eq. (24) has a simpler form than Eq. (22),although with the same number of parameters as Eq. (22).

The hardness model Eq. (24) can be rewritten as

$$
H = H _ { \mathrm { o } } \left[ 1 + \frac { V _ { \Omega } } { h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } ^ { 3 } } \right]
$$

where the parameter $V _ { \Omega }$ is expressed as

$$
V _ { \Omega } = k \Omega / \left[ \ln \left( \frac { 2 \dot { \gamma } ^ { P } } { \dot { \gamma } _ { 0 } ^ { P } } \right) + \frac { \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { \scriptscriptstyle T } } ) ^ { 2 } \Omega f ( \nu , \beta ) } { k _ { \mathrm { \scriptscriptstyle B } } T } \right] ,
$$

and the macro hardness $H _ { 0 }$ is expressed as

$$
H _ { 0 } = \frac { 1 3 . 2 k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } { \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } \Omega } \Bigg [ \mathrm { l n } \Bigg ( \frac { 2 \dot { \gamma } ^ { P } } { \dot { \gamma } _ { 0 } ^ { P } } \Bigg ) + \frac { \mu ( \gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } ) ^ { 2 } \Omega f ( \nu , \beta ) } { k _ { \mathrm { B } } T } \Bigg ] .
$$

It can be found that Eq.(25) has a similar form to Eq.(15) which characterizes the elastic hardness ISEs.More importantly, the exponent of $1 / { h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } }$ in Eq. (25) is 3,being larger than the exponent $m - 0 . 5$ in Eq. (15). These two features are wellconsistent with the inference in the endofSection 2.3.As discussed therein,if the plastic hardness ISEs are to becharacterized, the corrsponding hardness model should have asimilar form to Eq. (15),but with an exponent larger than $m - 0 . 5$ . Additionally, a dimensional analysis to Eq. (26) suggests that the parameter $V _ { \Omega }$ has a dimension of volume.This parameter can be seen as a higher-order volume parameter similar to the higher-order length parameter $l _ { \mathrm { R } }$ in Eq. (15).

# 3.2.Model verificationand discussion

In principle,the validity of model Eq. (25) should be ilustrated by hardness data containing only plastic ISEs. However,to separate the plastic ISEs from hardness data of polymers in Fig.5 is impossble. A compromise is applying it to the hardness data ofLDPE in which the plastic ISEs are dominant. As shown in Fig.9(a),a good agreement between the model and the experimental data is found. The macro hardness $H _ { 0 }$ and volume parameter $V _ { \Omega }$ are respectively estimated to be about $0 . 0 2 5 \mathrm { G P a }$ and $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } ~ \mathrm { { \ n m } } ^ { 3 }$ . Then the characteristic volume $\Omega$ of STZ is estimated to be about $2 7 1 8 ~ \mathrm { n m } ^ { 3 }$ (for choice $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } = 0 . 0 4$ ） and parameter $k$ is estimated to be about $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ ， respectively from Eq. (27) and Eq. (26). Taking the obtained $\Omega$ and $k$ into Eq. (20), the varying probability of nucleating STs with respect to $h _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ is depicted in Fig. 9(b). It can be seen that the probability curve is compatible with the hardness curve.When the indentation is implemented in small depths,the deformation zone is too smallt foster a ST event. As the indenter continues to move down,the probability is close to 1 which implies the massive nucleation of STs,and thus the hardness value correspondingly tends to be stable.

Fig.9.(a)Fiting the hardness model Eq.(25)to the experimentally obtained hardness ofLDPE (Tavares et al.[5]); (b)The probability of nucleating STs versus indentation depths obtained by substituting the fited values of $\Omega$ and $k$ into Eq. (20).

The presently obtained $\Omega$ of LDPE is close to the STZ volumes of several other polymers given by Mott et al.

[35]through molecular simulations,which range from hundreds to thousands of cubic nanometers.The presently obtained $k$ also has the same order of magnitude as that of PMMA estimated by Voyiadjis et al.[1O].Note that the determination of $\Omega$ is significantly sensitive to the chosen value of $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { { T } } }$ , for example, the $\Omega$ will be $1 1 8 3 \mathrm { n m } ^ { 3 }$ for choice $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { T } } = 0 . 0 5$ .The $\gamma ^ { \mathrm { { T } } }$ of PMMA is believed to be in the range of 0.03 to O.05 by the interpolation of experimental data (Malekmotiei etal.[36]; Voyiadjis etal.[10]),andthus the middle ofthis range is adopted in the present estimation. The temperature $T$ is set at $2 9 5 \mathrm { K }$ for room temperature experiments, as Tavares et al. [5] did not specify that the experiments were carried out under heating or cooling conditions.

The shear strain rate $\dot { \gamma } ^ { P }$ has been found to alter the macro hardness [1O],as illustrated in Eq. (27). However, its contribution is notable tojustifytheobserved indentation size effect inhardness33],although it emerges into the higher-order volume parameter $V _ { \Omega }$ . In above estimation of $\Omega$ ,the value of $\dot { \gamma } ^ { P }$ is obtained from $\dot { \gamma } ^ { P } = \sqrt { 3 } C \dot { \varepsilon } _ { i }$ （204号 where $C$ is a constant value equal to O.O9 and $\dot { \varepsilon } _ { i }$ the indentation strain rate [38,36].Tavares et al. [5] did not provide the indentation strain rate $\dot { \varepsilon } _ { i }$ , but stated that a high rate was adopted to minimize the influence of viscoelastic properties in the measurements. The above estimation assumes $\dot { \varepsilon } _ { i }$ to be $\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ s ^ { - 1 } ~ }$ . Additionally, the shear modulus $\mu$ （20 is obtained from $2 \mu = E / \left( 1 + \nu \right)$ where $\nu = 0 . 4$ [39] and $E$ is the macro modulus in Table 1 as Eq.(27) denotes the macro hardness.

# 4. Conclusions

The size efects in indentation modulus (modulus ISEs)and indentation hardness (hardnes ISEs)of polymers are theoretically modeled,on the basis ofliteratures which found that the modulus ISEs are elastic and the hardness ISEs can be divided into elastic part and plastic part in which the elastic part is likely to be dominant.The modulus ISEs andthe elastic hardness ISEs are modeled,by introducing a couple stresselasticity-based unloading model proposed in our previous work into Oliver-Pharr indentation approach.The resultant modulus model and hardness model, along with the corrsponding results of application to experimental data,show that these elastic size effects and their experimental showing are mainly determined by the molecular structures. Specifically, polymers with complex molecules would exhibit significant modulus ISEs.Besides,the hardness ISEs of this kind of polymers are significantly elastic.

The couple stres elasticity-based hardness model shows a shortage in characterizing the hardness ISEs of LDPE. We postulate that the hardnes ISEs ofLDPEare significantly plastic,due to its highly flexible molecular structures. As both the UHMWPE and PTFE with high crystallnity exhibit no indentation size effects,we postulate that the plastic hardness ISEs of polymers are only determined by their glassy components and may be described by a model ina similar formto thatofthe couple stress elasticity-based hardnessmodel. Basedon these considerations,the shear transformation plasticity theory proposed for amorphous solids is employed to characterize the plastic hardness ISEs of polymers.Accordingly,a hardness model is proposed and successfullyapplied to experimental data.Besides, the shear transformation plasticity-based hardness model is completely consistent with previous speculation.
