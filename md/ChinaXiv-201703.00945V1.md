Asoft segment free thermoplastic polyester elastomer is fabricated by controlling the stereochemical structure of molecular chains with the utilization of the cis 1,4-cyclohexylene ring moiety (cis-CHRM) in poly(butylene $^ { 1 , 4 }$ -cyclohexanedicarboxylate) (PBC).PBCwith $71 \%$ cisCHRM exhibits good elasticity with shape recovery rates of $64 \%$ at $200 \%$ strain and $92 \%$ at break, tensile modulus, strength and elongationat break at111 and $1 8 ~ \mathsf { M P a }$ and $1230 \%$ respectively.

# Introduction

Thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are a particular class of polymeric materials that possess both the facile processability of plastic and the superiorelasticity of rubber.1 Overthe past few decades,the traditional strategy to synthesize TPEs has been to introduce amorphous and flexible soft segments into thermoplastic polymer chains.Soft segments form micro-phase separated structures in the TPE matrix,providing superior elasticity. This traditional strategy has allowed for the development of many types of TPEs such as styrenic thermoplastic elastomers (TPSs),² thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPUs),34 thermoplastic poly(ether-amide) elastomers (TPAEs)5 and thermoplastic poly(ether-ester) elastomers (TPEEs).67

However,it is not ideal to introduce soft segments into a thermoplastic polymer chain because it always inevitably brings about a decrease in thermal and tensile properties of the thermoplastic polymer.&Therefore,it is interesting to develop an alternative methodology to synthesize TPEs without sacrificing their overall properties.As mentioned above,it is crucial not to introduce soft segments into TPEs in order to maintain their good tensile and thermal properties.On the other hand,the use of soft segments to induce“soft”phases in the TPE matrixisa prerequisite to initiate superior elasticity.Thus the traditional strategy is not suitable for fabricating TPEs with high overall tensile and thermal properties. It is therefore necessary to develop an alternative way to gain elasticity without using soft segments.It is well known that flexible polymer chains such as rubber and elastomers possess entropic elasticity and are able to recover their original shape after large deformation.This property is exactly like the one exhibited by soft segments in traditional TPEs.The only important difference between a plastic and a traditional TPE lies in the“soft”phases.This difference essentially suggests that a polymer with flexible chains can exhibit intrinsic elasticity if interactions between flexible chains are small. This inspires us to create a novel strategy to synthesize soft segment free TPEs by releasing the intrinsic elasticity of polymer chains.Accordingly,high performance particularlyhigh mechanical and thermal properties can be expected.

The most effective way to reduce intra-limitations between polymer chains is to introduce an irregular structure.For example,polybutadiene (PB) can be eithera plastic ora rubber, depending on its stereochemical structure.1,3-Butadiene can bepolymerized to PB mainly in two ways,1,4-trans and 1,4- cis.9,1o PB with a large number of 1,4-trans butadiene moieties can easily crystallize because of its regular structure,resulting in strong interactions between polymer chains.On the other hand,PB with a large number of irregular 1,4-cis butadiene moieties does not crystallize.The amorphous phases show the properties of a synthetic rubber.The aim of this work is to simultaneously improve the rigidity and toughness of polymers byincorporating non-planar hexatomic rings into their chains Hexatomic rings are relatively rigid and at the same time are ableto exhibit two different stereochemical structures (cis and trans，which are irregular and regular，respectively)in the synthesis of polymers.11-13 Accordingly， new TPEs containing non-planar hexatomic rings are expected.

The literature reported on the use of the 1,4-cyclohexylene ring moiety (CHRM),especially the trans-CHRMin the synthesis of thermoplastic polymers (particularly polyesters).13-19 As for poly(butylene 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate) (PBC)， thecisCHRM is rarely used.20-29 Therefore,only the properties of PBC as a plastic are studied.24-27 The effect of the cis-CHRM on its elasticity has been ignored.In this communication,we discuss on the effect of the cis-CHRM on the properties of PBC for the first time.By tuning the stereochemical structure of the CHRM, a new soft segment free TPE with high overall mechanical properties is proposed.Accordingly，a simple and effective strategy to synthesize soft segment free TPEs with high performance is established.

# Experimental section

# Synthesis

PBC was synthesized via a conventional melt polycondensation process from CHDA and BDO using titanium(iv) butoxide as a catalyst (Scheme 1).1³ The PBC samples are denoted as $\mathbf { P B C } x$ where $x$ is the number of cis-CHRMs in the polymer chain.

# Characterization

Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were measured on a PL-GPC220 gel permeation chromatograph (GPC).The structure and the number of cis-CHRMs in the polymer chains of PBC were determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance $\mathrm { \Lambda } ^ { \mathrm { ( 1 } } \mathrm { H \ N M R ) }$ in $\mathbf { C D C l } _ { 3 }$ solvent using a Bruker AVII4oo NMR spectrometer at room temperature.Differential scanning calorimetry (DsC) measurements were performed using a differential scanning calorimeter of type METTLERTOLEDO DSC I. Thermal stability measurements were conducted using a Mettler-Toledo TGA/DSC thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA).Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted with a METTLER-TOLEDO dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA/SDTA861e) at a fixed frequency of $1 ~ \mathrm { H z }$ ，operating in the film tension mode.Tensile testing and cyclic tensile testing were performed using an Instron5567 tensile testing machinewithaloadcell of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { N }$

# Results and discussion

PBCsare synthesized viaa convenient melt polycondensation process from1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (CHDA) with1,4- butanediol (BDO) (Scheme 1).The number of cis-CHRMs in the final products ranges from 12 to $7 1 \%$ (Table1),as determined by ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR (Fig.1).Deviation of the final compositions from the feed ones is observed due to the isomerization between cis and trans isomers at high temperature.o In fact, the number of cisCHRMs at thermodynamic equilibrium is $34 \%$ ,17 and once it is not in this balanced state at high temperature,isomerization is inevitable.The more the deviation from the balanced state,the more isomerization will occur. Thus only $1 \%$ and $6 \%$ of isomerization are found forPBC36 and PBC44,respectively,but $1 1 \%$ and $2 6 \%$ of isomerization occurred for PBC12 and PBC71, respectively. All sampleshave a similar number-average molecular weight $\left( M _ { \mathrm { n } } \right)$ and molecular weight distribution $( M _ { \mathrm { w } } /$ $M _ { \mathrm { n } _ { \it } }$ ）ofabout 30 ooo and 2.5，respectively (Table 1).Thus differences in the properties of PBC mainly depend on the numberof cis-CHRMs.

PBC turns from a semicrystalline polymer to an amorphous onewhen the number of cis-CHRMs increases from 12 to $7 1 \%$ (Table 2).An interesting phenomenon is observed for PBC44, whose second heating scan shows cold crystallization and melting temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { m } } \right)$ (Fig.2a),while the cooling scan does not show a crystallization temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { c } } \right)$ (Fig.2b).This phenomenon indicates that when the number of cis-CHRMs increases from $12 \%$ to $4 4 \%$ ,the irregular structure introduces more“kinks”into the polymer chain,1’ which will hinder the formation of crystalline domains by trans-CHRMs when cooling frommelt.However,a substantial number of trans-CHRMs in thepolymerchain ( $5 6 \%$ forPBC44) can still induce cold crys tallization when the polymer chain is flexible at a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature.Thus the second heating scan of PBC44 shows cold crystallization and $T _ { \mathrm { m } }$ .Given a $9 9 \%$ trans-CHDA, mix-CHDA (cis/trans 50/50) and $9 7 \%$ cis-CHDA were used as starting materials for PBC12,PBC44 and PBC71,respectively, and a mixture of $9 9 \%$ trans-CHDA and mix-CHDA was used as a starting material for PBC36. Calculated from ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR in $\mathrm { C D C l } _ { 3 }$ based on the integration of signals at 2.47 ppm and $2 . 2 8 ~ \mathrm { p p m }$ ，which could be assigned to the protons of -CH-in cis- and trans-CHRMs, respectively.13‘Determined by GPC in $\mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 }$ ：

that both PBC12 and PBC36 have $T _ { \mathrm { m } }$ and $T _ { \mathrm { c } }$ ,while PBC71 has no $T _ { \mathrm { m } ; }$ ,the transition of PBC from a semicrystalline polymer to an amorphous one should occur between $3 6 \%$ and $4 4 \%$ .Berti et al. found a value close to this range.1³ Moreover,an increase in the number of cis-CHRMs results ina steady decrease in the glass transition temperature,as evidenced by both DSC $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \right)$ and DMA $\left( T _ { \alpha } \right)$ (Table 2).Therefore,the incorporation of cis-CHRMs plays a role in reducing the interactions among PBC chains and therefore their ability to crystallize.13,31 In addition,all PBCs have high thermal stability regardless of the number of cisCHRMs (Table 2),with $T _ { 5 \% }$ around $3 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ and $3 6 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in air atmosphere,respectively.

The fact that PBC changes from a semicrystalline polymer to anamorphous one as the number of cis-CHRMs increases has a significant effect on its tensile properties.Table 3 shows the tensile properties of PBC with different numbers of cis-CHRMs and Fig.3 shows the representative strain-stress curves.It is seen thatall four samples show strain-stress curves fora typical thermoplastic polyester which consists of four regions:² (1) linear and non-linear viscoelasticity，(2） neck region/strain softening,(3) plastic flow and (4) strain hardening.For the three semicrystalline samples,as the number of cis-CHRMs increases, $\chi _ { \mathrm { c } }$ decreases. Thus $E$ and $\sigma _ { \mathrm { y } }$ decrease whereas $\sigma _ { \mathrm { t } } , \varepsilon _ { \mathbf { { b } } }$ and $\varepsilon _ { \mathbf { y } }$ increase,as expected.On the otherhand,itis interesting to note that the tensile properties especially $E$ ofPBC71 and PBC12 are comparable except $\varepsilon _ { \mathbf { b } }$ which differs greatly. It is $1 2 3 0 \%$ and $5 2 0 \%$ for PBC71and PBC12,respectively.A higher $\varepsilon _ { \mathbf { b } }$ is due to a larger amount of the amorphous region.A fully amorphous sample is expected to have a much higher $\scriptstyle { \varepsilon _ { \mathbf { b } } }$ than a semicrystalline one.However，due to the strain hardening effect,33 PBC44 has the highest $\varepsilon _ { \mathrm { { b } } }$ although the amount of amorphous region of PBC44 is smaller than that of PBC71.

@ The recovery rate at $2 0 0 \%$ strain $\left( R _ { \mathrm { r } } ( N ) \right)$ for the Nth cycle in the cyclic tensile testing and the recovery rate at break $\left( R _ { \mathrm { r b } } \right)$

The elastic properties of PBC are investigated by cyclic tensile testing. Table 4 shows the recovery rates of the cyclic tensile testing with $2 0 0 \%$ strain $\left( R _ { \mathrm { r } } \right)$ .When the number of cisCHRMs increases from $12 \%$ to $7 1 \%$ ,the first cycle recovery rate of PBC increases steadily from $1 1 \%$ to $6 4 \%$ ,confirming the shift of PBC from a plastic to a TPE. The elastic properties of PBC are also shown by the shape recovery rate at break $\left( R _ { \mathrm { r b } } \right)$ (Table 4). The $R _ { \mathrm { r b } }$ ofPBC increases as the number of cis-CHRMs increases and reaches $9 2 \%$ with $7 1 \%$ cis-CHRM.

The high elasticity of traditional TPEs originates from soft segments.34 It is like part of the polymer chains of a hard plastic aremodified to become soft.The intrinsic entropic elasticity of hard segments is restrained due to high $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ or strong interactions between molecular chains such as crystallization and hydrogen bonding.Thus polymer chains are either frozen in a glassy state (e.g.polystyrene and PBT) or the chain mobilityis restricted by strong interactions between polymer chains (e.g. polyamide and polyurethane).As a result,soft segments have to be incorporated by copolymerization or blending to introduce external entropic elasticity.In fact,it is impossible for this type of modification to completely avoid the obvious decrease of mechanical modulus and strength.

By contrast,the strategy we have developed is to modify polymer chains in such a way that their intrinsic entropic elasticity can be fully released.The formation of an amorphous region by the incorporation of irregular non-planar ring moieties into polymer chains promotes the effective release of the intrinsic entropic elasticity of PBC.Since PBC with a full transCHRM is a semicrystalline plastic with a $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ of $1 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,13 part of the polymer chains are flexible and in their rubber-elastic state at room temperature but are restricted by the crystalline domains. Thusbreaking the crystalline domains formed by trans-CHRMs will release the intrinsic entropic elasticity and achieve the transition from a plastic to a TPE.Manipulation of stereochemistry,i.e.，partial replacement of a trans-CHRM bya cisCHRM whose structure is irregular, successfully results in the shift of PBC from a plastic to a TPE.The cis-CHRM not only plays a role as an irregular structure to break the crystalline domains but also decreases the $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ of PBC.It is noteworthy that TPEs with intrinsic entropic elasticity are flexible amorphous materials. Instead of calling upon crystallization or strong interactions,they have chain entanglements which act as physical net points to prevent excessive chain slipping which would result in permanent deformation.34,35 In the case of PBC, chain entanglements not only prevent large permanent deformation upon an external stress (the permanent deformation at break of PBC with $7 1 \%$ cis-CHRM is only $8 \%$ )，but also are responsible for the high $E$ ,which is even comparable to that of the semicrystalline PBC. Similar processes with the aim to alter theregularity of polymer chains are the copolymerization of ethylene with vinyl acetate and to produce ethylene-vinyl acetate elastomers (EVAs) and that of propylene (or a third diene monomer (DM)） to produce ethylene-propylene elastomers (EP or EPDMs).

Another advantage of using non-planar ring moieties to synthesize TPEs is that it is possible to obtain both superior elasticityand high mechanical modulus and strength.Table 3 shows that $E$ $\sigma _ { \mathrm { { t } } }$ and $\varepsilon _ { \mathbf { b } }$ of PBC71 are as high as 111 MPa, $1 8 \mathrm { \ : M P a }$ and $1 2 3 0 \%$ ,respectively.Their modulus and strength are much higher than those of a TPE obtained by the traditional strategy.8,36-40

# Conclusions

Insummary,we havedevelopedasoft segment free strategy for the synthesis of high performance TPEs via the manipulation of stereochemistry for plastics with intrinsic entropic elasticity.By incorporation of irregular non-planar ring moieties into polymerchains,the crystalline region is disrupted and the intrinsic entropic elasticity is released. Compared with TPEs obtained by the traditional strategy,the new strategy reported in this paper with the manipulation of stereochemistry of CHRMs is much simpler and more effective to achieve soft segment free TPEs with high overall mechanical and thermal properties.More importantly,our research provides a new guideline for the synthesis of TPEs from plastics based on the release of the intrinsic entropic elasticity from their polymer chains.
