# ABSTRACT

Keywords: Metallic glasses Glass transition Relaxation Kinetic stability

Metallic glasses are non-equilibrium materials and the glass transition temperature upon heating $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ can be used to characterize the kinetic stability of the glass.Annealing below the glass transition is wellknown to induce relaxation processes that reduce the glass enthalpy.We demonstrate that a liquidcooled Au-based metalic glass can achieve very high kinetic stability by an optimal annealing treatment to yield a large increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ of $2 8 ~ \mathrm { K }$ ；this is 3-5 times larger than the increase usually reported. The measured enthalpy decrease of $1 1 0 0 \mathrm { J / m o l }$ is about $50 \%$ of the difference between the as-cooled glass and the equilibrium crystalline state and reaches the extrapolated enthalpy of the supercooled liquid. The optimal annealing conditions can be determined byan enthalpy-temperature-time (ETT) diagram which is proposed for the first time based on the comprehensive examination of relaxation processes. At equilibrium,a direct relation is established between the increase in kinetic stability as measured by the increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g h } }$ and the enthalpy decrease.

# 1.Introduction

Metallic glasses exhibit excellent physical and chemical properties，such as soft magnetic properties，good catalytic performance，high strength and good corrosion resistance [1-4]. However,as a result of their far-from-equilibrium nature,the properties of metallic glasses change with time as they relax towards low energy states.Increasing the kinetic stability of metallic glasses would extend their utility to higher temperatures.It has been found that the kinetic stability of glasses can be increased by using vapor deposition fabrication methods [5-11]. Vapordeposited glasses can achieve low enthalpyand high kinetic stability as indicated bya long transformation time and an increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ (glass transition onset temperature measured on heating) [5-8,10-13]. Fast molecular/atomic mobility on the surface during deposition is believed to allow access to stable low energy states [5,6].However, vapor deposition methods cannot be used to prepare bulk materials.An efficient approach towards bulk metallic glasseswith highkinetic stabilityandlowenthalpy has yet to be developed.An advance along these lines would not only supply important new materials,but also would provide a critical set of comparisons with vapor-deposited ultrastable glasses and be helpful for exploring fundamental issues regarding amorphous materials.

It is well known that annealing glasses below the glass transition temperature can cause relaxation towards the equilibrium supercooled liquid.In this structural relaxation process,typically the kinetic stability increases while the enthalpy decreases.For example, Zhu et al. found that $7 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } s$ annealing at $0 . 8 9 T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ can increase $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ by about $8 \mathrm { K }$ with an enthalpy decrease of about $2 3 \mathrm { J / g }$ for $\mathrm { Z r } _ { 5 2 . 5 } \mathrm { C u } _ { 1 7 . 9 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 1 4 . 6 } \mathrm { A l } _ { 1 0 } \mathrm { T i } _ { 5 }$ [14]. Kohda et al. found that $4 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } s$ annealing at $0 . 9 7 T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ can increase $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ by about7 Kwith an enthalpy decrease of_about $3 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { g }$ for $\mathrm { P t } _ { 6 0 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 1 5 } \mathrm { P } _ { 2 5 }$ [15].Haruyama et al. found that $6 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } s$ annealing at $0 . 9 4 T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ can increase $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ by about $1 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ with an enthalpy decrease of about $5 . 5 ~ \mathrm { J / g }$ for $\mathrm { P d } _ { 4 2 . 5 } \mathrm { C u } _ { 3 0 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 7 . 5 } \mathrm { P } _ { 2 0 }$ [16].In other cases however, the enthalpy decrease that occurs during annealing is not accompanied by an increase in kinetic stability.For a $\mathrm { P d } _ { 4 2 . 5 } \mathrm { C u } _ { 3 0 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 7 . 5 } \mathrm { P } _ { 2 0 }$ metallic glass,it was found that annealing for short times $( < 2 0 0 \ s )$ could lower both the enthalpy and the kinetic stability [16]. An $\mathsf { A u } _ { 4 9 } \mathsf { C u } _ { 2 6 . 9 } \mathsf { A g } _ { 5 . 5 } \mathsf { P d } _ { 2 . 3 } \mathsf { S i } _ { 1 6 . 3 }$ metallic glass exhibited no obvious change in $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ while the enthalpy decreased byabout $3 . 7 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { g }$ when annealed at $0 . 7 7 T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ for one year [17].A 2O-million-year-old amber glass exhibited no obvious change in $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ while the enthalpy decreased about $2 6 \mathrm { ~ J / g ~ }$ [18]; in contrast,110-million-year-old amber exhibits a $1 5 \mathrm { K }$ increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ with an enthalpy decrease of only about $8 \ : \mathrm { J / g }$ [19]. The annealing effect on kinetic stability (i.e.increase of $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } } .$ )has not been studied sufficiently to understand this range of behavior.We expect that there are opportunities to increase the kinetic stability of metallic glasses by optimizing the annealing protocol.

Calorimetry has been a very effective method in measuring the phase transitions in glassy materials.A recently developed nanocalorimetor commerciallized by Mettler-Toledo,Flash DSC1,extends the heating rates up to $4 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } / { s }$ and cooling rates up to 10,000 K/s [2O-22].The capability of heating so fast provides chances to observe some abnormal phase transition behaviors and studying the extreme kinetics of phase transition materials [8,23-26]. The capability of cooling so fast makes it possible to obtain glasses from liquidswith poor glass-formingability,suchas metallic glasses,and study their thermal properties in situ [27,28]. Such an emerging powerful technique will provide chances to explore new materials and new properties of existing materials.

In this work,we studied the kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of a liquid-cooled $\mathsf { A u _ { 4 9 } C u _ { 2 6 . 9 } A g _ { 5 . 5 } P d _ { 2 . 3 } S i _ { 1 6 . 3 } }$ metallic glass(Au-MG）annealed for various times at temperatures in a range between $0 . 7 8 T _ { \mathrm { g , c } }$ and $T _ { \mathrm { g , c } }$ 0 $T _ { \mathrm { g , c } }$ is the onset glass transition temperature upon cooling）using Flash DSC.The annealing time was varied across more than six orders of magnitude in these experiments.Froma comprehensive examination of the temperatureand time-dependent behaviors,an enthalpy-temperature-time (ETT）diagram is obtained for the first time to show how the annealing temperature is combined optimally with the annealing time.Under optimal annealinga relationis established between the increase in kinetic stability and the decrease of glass enthalpy.

# 2.Experimental methods

Metallicglassribbonswithnominalcompositionof $\mathsf { A u } _ { 4 9 } \mathsf { C u } _ { 2 6 . 9 } \mathsf { A g } _ { 5 . 5 } \mathsf { P d } _ { 2 . 3 } \mathsf { S i } _ { 1 6 . 3 }$ (at.%，a bulk glass former [29]）were prepared using an induction melter equipped with a spinning roller protected under an atmosphere of high-purity Ar gas.The tangent speed of the roller is $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m } / s$ .The thickness of the ribbon is about $3 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and the width is about $2 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ .The thermal properties of the alloy were studied using a high-rate differential scanning calorimeter (Flash DSC1,Mettler Toledo) [22].During measurement,a flow of ${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ gas $( 1 5 \mathrm { m l / m i n } )$ was applied to protect the sample from oxidation.The allowable sample mass for Flash DSC is between $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g } }$ and $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ Arepresentative Flash DSC trace ina coolingand heating cycle is shown in Fig.1(a). The melting enthalpy of the tested sample isabout $9 . 9 5 \pm 0 . 3 6 \mu \mathrm { J }$ .The specific melting enthalpy of the melt-spun Au-based MG is measured to be $4 0 . 2 \pm 0 . 4 \mathrm { { J } / \mathrm { { g } } }$ usinga Perkin Elmer Diamond DSC ata heating rate of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { K / m i n }$ Thus,the mass of the Flash DSC sample is determined to be $9 . 9 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } / 4 0 . 2 g = ( 2 4 8 \pm 9 ) \times 1 0 ^ { - 9 } \ : \mathrm { g } \ : [ ( 1 . 9 5 \pm 0 . 0 7 ) \times 1 0 ^ { - 9 } \ :$ mole].

To determine the critical cooling rate $\left( R _ { \mathrm { c } } \right)$ for suppressing the crystallization upon cooling,various cooling rates were applied and the crystallization enthalpy $\left( { H } _ { \mathrm { x } } \right)$ on subsequent heating was measured.For the sample cooled at high enough $R _ { ☉ }$ the $H _ { \mathrm { X } }$ becomes a constant (about $7 . 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { J } .$ ),which means the sampleis completely amorphous.The $R _ { \mathrm { c } }$ range is determined to be $9 0 0 { - } 1 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { K } / s$ as shown in Fig.1(b).In subsequent experiments,a cooling rate of $6 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } / s$ $( { > } R _ { \mathrm { c } } )$ was employed to obtain completely amorphous samples. The $T _ { \mathrm { g , c } }$ was determined to be $4 3 9 \pm 1 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ for coolingrates between $2 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } / s$ and $1 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } / { s }$

To study the stability of samples annealed at different temperatures and for various times,cycles of cooling-annealing-heating were applied for the same sample.A schematic figure illustrating one cycle of the above experimental procedure is shown in Fig.2(a). A corresponding DSC heat flow trace is also shown in Fig.2(b).

The alpha relaxation time $( \tau _ { \mathfrak { A } } )$ at different temperatures was measured using two methods.At temperatures below $4 2 0 ~ \mathrm { K } ,$ the time for the glass to relax to the supercooled liquid state is treated as equal to the $\tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ [18].At temperatures above $4 2 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ the $\tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ was measured using an ac DSC measurement with a temperature oscillation amplitude of $1 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ and a frequency range from $5 0 ~ \mathrm { H z }$ to $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { H z }$ .Foragiven frequency $( 1 / t _ { 0 } )$ ,the temperature was scanned from $4 0 8 \mathrm { K }$ to $4 6 8 \mathrm { K } .$ At low temperature,the sample responds as a glass with a low heat capacity,while at high temperatures,the sample respondsasa liquid with a large heat capacity.The temperature where the sample transforms from a glass-like to liquidlike behavior at the given oscillation period $t _ { 0 }$ is recognized as the temperature where $\tau _ { \mathscr { A } } = t _ { 0 } / 2 \pi$

Upon cooling,the onset glass transition temperature $( T _ { \mathrm { g , c } } )$ can be determined.(b) The $H _ { \mathrm { X } }$ of the samples cooled at various cooling rates (R).The lowest cooling rate to obtain fully amorphous sample is defined as the critical cooling rate $\left( R _ { \mathrm { c } } \right)$ ,which is about $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { K } / { \mathsf { s } }$ (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

To determine the glass-to-liquid transition time $( t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } } )$ fora glass in a low energy state,the temperature is first raised to the destination temperature (at $6 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } / s$ )and then held isothermally. During isothermal annealing,ac DSC measurement (amplitude: 1 K)was applied to determine the time when the glass transforms completely to a liquid.The isothermal ac method was used to measure the $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ at temperatures of 428 K,433 K,438 K and $4 4 8 \mathrm { K } .$ The data at about $4 6 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ were measured by heating the metallic glass continuously at $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } / s$ . The peak temperature of the $C _ { \mathfrak { p } }$ overshoot is about $4 6 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ and is treated as the transition temperature.The time from the onset to the endset of the overshoot is treated approximately as the trans·

# 3.Results

Representative DSC curves of the heat capacity $( C _ { \mathfrak { p } } )$ for samples annealed at $3 7 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ for various times are shown in Fig.3(a).As the annealing time increases,the $C _ { \mathfrak { p } }$ overshoot at the glass transition increases and the glass transition onset temperature $( T _ { \mathrm { g , h } } )$ also increases accordingly with a maximum increase of $2 8 ~ \mathrm { K }$ .The $C _ { \mathfrak { p } }$ and crystallization temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { X } } \right)$ of the supercooled liquid do not change which denotes that the supercooled liquids are in the same equilibrium state and the annealed glasses are fully amorphous. The enthalpy of the sample [including that of the glass $( H _ { \mathrm { G } } )$ ，the liquid $( H _ { \mathrm { L } } )$ and the crystal $\left( H _ { \mathrm { C } } \right) ]$ is obtained by integrating the heat capacity,as shown in Fig.3(b). The $H _ { \mathrm { L } }$ is fitted using a polynomial equation, $H _ { L } = - 2 5 . 8 + 0 . 0 9 3 T { - 6 . 2 } \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } T ^ { 2 } { + 3 } \times 1 0 ^ { - 8 } T ^ { 3 }$ [with $H _ { \mathrm { L } }$ in $\mathrm { \ k J / m o l }$ and $T$ in K,see the orange solid curve (in the web version) inFig.3(b)].The $H _ { \mathsf { C } }$ isfittedby alinearequation, $H _ { C } = - 1 3 . 2 + 0 . 0 3 8 T$ [with $H _ { \mathsf { C } }$ is inkJ/mol andTinK,the black dashdotted line in Fig.3(b)].To more clearly show the change of $H _ { \mathrm { G } }$ with annealing, $H _ { G }$ is presented relative to $H _ { C }$ in Fig. 3(c). The enthalpy of the glass decreases gradually upon annealing until it reaches halfway to the enthalpy of the equilibrium crystalline state.

The enthalpy change $( \Delta H )$ of the metallic glass during annealing is shown versus the annealing temperature and time in Fig.4.First, to measure the $\Delta H$ dependence on temperature $( T )$ ,the sample was annealed at various temperatures fora constant time,as shown in Fig. 4(a). For a given annealing time, $\Delta H$ reaches a minimum at a temperature $( T _ { \mathrm { m i n } } )$ below $T _ { \mathrm { g , c } }$ The $T _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ decreases as the annealing time increases.Although the $\Delta H$ on the low temperature side decreases systematically,it does not keep decreasing on the high temperature side,but merges into a single curve when the annealing time is long enough.In addition，to measure the dependence of $\Delta H$ onannealing time,the sample wasannealed for various times at a given temperature,as shown in Fig.4(b).For example,at 4O3K,△H initiallydecreaseswith increasingannealing time and then becomes constant.

The temperaturedependent enthalpies of the fully-relaxed glasses measured on heating are shown as solid curves.The enthalpy of the as-cooled glass measured on heating(black curve) is shown for comparison.(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

It is noteworthy that $\Delta H$ merges on the high temperature side in Fig.4(a) and becomes constant when the annealing time is long enough in Fig.4(b).The enthalpies of these fully-relaxed glassesare shown as the filled symbols in Fig.4(c).All these data are consistent with the extrapolation of the enthalpy of the supercooled liquid from higher temperatures.This indicates that the lower limit on the right-hand side (orange curve) in Fig.4(a) and the long-time plateaus in Fig.4(b) represent the equilibrium supercooled liquid.As shown in Fig.4(a),the maximum loss in enthalpy in a given time occurs at temperatures where the sample does not reach equilibrium.The optimal combination of annealing temperature and annealing time for obtaining the lowest enthalpy glass is determined by both the relaxation kinetics and the position of the metastable equilibrium state.Analogous results have been obtained for vapor-deposited glasses;in this case,substrate temperature corresponds to annealing temperature and deposition rate corresponds to the inverse of the annealing time[1O-12].

To provide a conceptual picture of the evolution of enthalpy during annealing,2-dimensional and 3-dimensional plots of △H versus annealing temperature and annealing time are shown in Fig.5.Upon annealing,the enthalpy of the glass decreases due to physical aging.When the annealing time is long enough,the enthalpy becomes constant which represents the equilibrium supercooled liquid (ESL) state.The time for the glass to relax to the ESL increases with decreasing temperature.The ESL state is metastable and the samples will eventually crystallize.We note that manyprevious investigations have annealed glasses isothermally toobtain the crystallization temperature-time-transformation (TTT)diagram to evaluate glass formingability.However,less information has been obtained about what happens during the isothermal annealing process before crystallization.Fig.5(b) shows that the sample experiences two stages before crystallization:the first is a nonequilibrium relaxation stage(glass)and the second is a metastable equilibrium stage (extrapolation of supercooled liquid).

The determination of alpha relaxation time $\cdot \tau _ { \mathscr { a } } = 0 . 0 0 3 2 s$ using AC measurement is shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b).The determination of the isothermal glass-to-liquid transition time ( $( t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } } )$ at 428 K for the highly stable glass that equilibrated at $3 7 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ is shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). The $\tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ and the $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ for the glasses equilibrated at $3 7 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ and $3 8 8 \mathrm { K }$ are shown in Fig. 6(e). For a given temperature, the $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ ismuch larger than $\tau _ { \mathfrak { A } }$ ，which denotesa highkinetic stability.Accordingto Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan(TNM) model [3O], the isothermal time evolution of fictive temperature ( $T _ { \mathrm { f } } ,$ the cross temperature of the glass enthalpy and liquid enthalpy）or glass enthalpy $( H )$ followinga single temperature step from equilibrium $\left( T _ { 0 } \right)$ at time $t _ { 1 }$ can be described usinga relaxation function

$$
T _ { \mathrm { f } } ( t ) = T _ { 0 } + \Delta T [ 1 - \phi ( t - t _ { 1 } , t ) ]
$$

where $t$ is relaxation time at temperature $T _ { 0 } + \varDelta T , T _ { 0 }$ is the temperature of the initial equilibrium state, $\phi ( t - t _ { 1 } , t )$ is both a nonexponential and a nonlinear function which can be expressed as

$$
\phi ( t - t _ { 1 } , t ) = \exp \left[ - \left( \int _ { t _ { 1 } } ^ { t } d t \prime / \tau _ { 0 } \right) ^ { \beta } \right]

# 4.Discussion

During isothermal annealing,the nonequilibrium glass always relaxes towards the equilibrium supercooled liquid state.The relaxation can be divided into two types: the agingwhen $H _ { \mathrm { G } } > H _ { \mathrm { L } }$ and the de-aging when $H _ { \mathrm { G } } < H _ { \mathrm { L } }$ [18,32]. The isothermal transition time $( t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } } )$ from glass to liquid is related to the alpha-relaxation time ( $\cdot \tau _ { \mathfrak { A } }$ ，the rearrangement time of atoms or molecules in the equilibrium state). That is, $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } } \leq \tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ for aging, and $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } } > \tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ for deaging[18].Upon heating,the ordinary glass that was quenched directly from a liquid will transform quickly into liquid when its enthalpy meets that of the supercooled liquid,which denotes that the $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ is comparable to $\tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ 、Atypical character of ultrastable glasses is that the $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ is much longer than the $\tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ in the de-aging state [33],see Fig.6(e).The glass equilibrated at 388 K has a smaller $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ compared to the glass equilibrated at $3 7 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ ,which denotesa smaller kinetic stability and is consistent with the higher enthalpy of this glass. The $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ of the Au-MG equilibrated at $3 7 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ is about $1 0 ^ { 2 } – 1 0 ^ { 4 . 2 }$ higher than $\tau _ { \mathfrak { A } }$ ,which is similar to that reported for vapordeposited ultrastable glasses,although for the most stable vapordeposited glasses these results were obtained for larger values of $\tau _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ [33]. The $t _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ values can be well fitted using the TNM model [30],as shown by the solid curves in Fig. 6(e). The fitting parameters are determined to be $\beta = 0 . 4 5$ $x = 0 . 5$ for the glass equilibrated at $3 7 3 \mathrm { K } ,$ and $\beta = 0 . 7$ $x = 0 . 6$ for the glass equilibrated at $3 8 8 \mathrm { K } .$ The glass in equilibriumat 373Kexhibits a stronger dependence on the fictive temperature $T _ { \mathrm { f } }$ and is less dependent on temperature (the parameter $x$ in Eq.(3） is smaller) compared to the glass in equilibrium at $3 8 3 ~ \mathrm { K } ,$ which also denotes higher stability.

The increase of kinetic stability (e.g. higher $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ )combined with the decrease in enthalpy has been widely observed in vapordeposited ultrastable glasses [5-7,1O-13].However, the quantitative relationship between kinetic stability and enthalpy has not been systematically investigated for bulk metallic glasses.It is valuable to examine the relation between $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ and enthalpy for the present annealed metallic glass. The $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ is plotted versus the glass enthalpychange $( \Delta H )$ forthe samplesannealedatvariousTand for various times,as shown in Fig.7.When the annealing temperature is well below $T _ { \mathrm { g , c } } ,$ e.g. $3 5 8 \mathrm { K } ,$ the $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ will first decrease along with the decrease of enthalpy upon annealing which can be found in Fig. 7(a) and other works [17,34]. For further annealing, the $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ increases along with the decrease of enthalpy,which can be found in Fig.7(b).When the annealing time is long enough,the dependence of $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ on $\varDelta H$ tends to merge with the data that annealed slightly below $T _ { \mathrm { g , c } }$ ，When the annealing temperature is slightly below $T _ { \mathrm { g , c } } ,$ the $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ will increase along with the decrease of enthalpy upon annealing.There exists a maximum value for the increase of $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ and the decrease of enthalpy,as is marked by the arrows in

Fig.7(c);this occurs when the sample reaches the equilibrium supercooled liquid state.These values of $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ havea linearrelation with 4H with a slope of about $d T _ { \mathrm { g , h } } / d H = - 2 9 . 7 ( \pm 0 . 5 ) \mathrm { m o l . K / k J }$

It is interesting to note that the kinetic stability decreases ( $\cdot T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ decreases）while the thermodynamic stability increases (enthalpy decreases） for short-time annealing at low temperatures.Such behavior has also been observed in another Pd-based metallic glass and has been associated with volume dilatation during short-time annealingat low temperatures[16].This can be elucidated in terms of the two-components model that includes positive as well as negative fluctuations in local density [16]. Such a decrease in enthalpy has been attributed to the slow $\cdot \beta$ relaxation [17,34], which derives from local rearrangements of atoms.However,when the glass gets to equilibrium after a long-time annealing at low temperatures or being annealed close to glass transition temperature，the $\mathfrak { a }$ -relaxation(universal rearrangement ofnearestneighbor structure) takes over. Thus,we propose that the $\mathfrak { a }$ -relaxation process causesan increase in kinetic stabilityand decrease in enthalpy,while the slow- $\beta$ relaxation can only induce a decrease in enthalpy.

Annealing glasses below the glass transition temperature has been widely studied and has been applied to release the residual stress [14,16,35-38]. A large increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ by about $1 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ was observed in polymer glasses [35,36].However,the change of $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ for metallic glasses isusually less than10K[14,15,32,37,38],which was attributed to the low fragility of the glass forming liquid [9].The large increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ by $2 8 \mathrm { K }$ obtained here isabout3-5 times larger thanpreviously reported values for metallic glass relaxation.As is shown in Fig. 4(a), if the annealing temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ is too high, the small enthalpy difference between the as-cooled glass and the equilibrium supercooled liquid limits the increase of kinetic stability.As is shown in Fig.7,if the annealing temperature is too low, short-time annealing $\left( t _ { \mathrm { a } } < < \tau _ { \alpha } \right)$ can decrease the glass enthalpy but will not increase $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ which can be attributed to the heterogeneous nature of slow- $\cdot \beta$ relaxation [18,17,39].To obtain the largest increase in stability at a given annealing time $\left( t _ { \mathrm { a } } \right)$ ，the optimal annealing temperature for this Au-MG is $_ { 6 - 1 0 \mathrm { K } }$ lower than the temperature where $\tau _ { \mathfrak { a } } = t _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ .The optimal annealing curve can be expressed by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation as $T _ { \mathrm { a } } = 2 7 4 + 1 3 2 / \log ( t _ { \mathrm { a } } ) ,$ asis shown by the dashed curve in Fig.5(b).Using the optimal annealing method,we also obtained high kinetic stability starting from the as-spun ribbon,as shown in Fig.8.Thus,the high stability can be attributed to the optimal combination of annealing temperature and annealing time,regardless of the sample fabrication method.

When fabricating ultrastable glasses using vapor deposition, elevated atomic mobilitywithin the surface layer(several nanometers)playsa key role in promoting the rearrangement of atoms to approach their equilibrium configurations [6,4O-42]. Vapor deposition is very inefficient for fabricating thick samples or bulk glasses.In contrast, the melt-spun Au-MG samples studied here have a thickness of about $2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ .The optimal annealing method identified in this paper is not limited to ribbons but isalso applicable for liquid-cooled bulk metallic glasses.The heating rate dependence of the $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ fora highly stable glass isalso studied,as is shown in Fig.9. Compared to a less stable glass,the $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ for the highly stable glass exhibits the same heating rate dependent behavior. This denotes that the large increase of $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } }$ by $2 8 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ observed in this work does not derive from the heating rate effect.

# 5.Conclusion

We have demonstrated that liquid-cooled metallic glasses can be fabricated with very high kinetic stability (e.g.,high $T _ { \mathrm { g , h } } \mathrm { , }$ .In order to achieve high kinetic stability from liquid-cooled glasses, the optimal combination of annealing temperature and annealing timeis of vital importance.The relationship between the glass-toliquid transition temperature/time and enthalpy states has been studied systematically.We propose that the $\mathfrak { a }$ -relaxation process causes an increase in kinetic stability and decrease in enthalpy, while the slow- $\cdot \beta$ relaxation can only induce a decrease in enthalpy. Alinear relationship is established between the increase inkinetic stability as measured by the increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g h } }$ and the enthalpy decrease for the equilibrated glasses.While these results are specific to this Au-based MG,we expect that similar increases in kinetic stability can be obtained for many other metallic glasses and that this can widen the temperature range for applications.
