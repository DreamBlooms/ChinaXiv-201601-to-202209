The type Ilsecretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is tightly regulated by various environmental signals,such as low calcium and contact with the host cell. However,the exact signals triggering type Illsecretion are unknown.The present study describes the finding that secretion of P.aeruginosa type Ill effector molecules requires protein factors from serum and L broth,designated type Ill secretion factors (TSFs), inaddition to the low-calcium environment. In the absence of TSF or calcium chelator EGTA,basal levels of type Ill effector molecules are accumulated intracellularly.Addition of TSFand EGTA together effectively triggers the secretion of pre-existing effector molecules in a short time,even before the active expression of type ll genes; thus,active type Ill gene expression does not seem to be a prerequisite for type Ill secretion. A search forTSF molecules in serumand Lbroth resulted in the identification of albumin and casein as the functional TSF molecules.Although there is no clear sequence similarity between albumin and casein, both proteins are known to have a low-affinity, high-capacity calcium-binding property.Tests of well-studied calcium-binding proteins seemed to indicate that low-affinity calcium-binding proteins have TSFactivity,although the requirement of low-affinity calcium-binding ability for the TSF activity is not clear. $P .$ aeruginosa seems to have evolveda sensing mechanism to detect target cells for type Illinjection through host-derived proteins in combination with a low-calcium signal. Disruption of the bacterial ability to sense low calcium or TSF might bea valid avenue to the effective control of this bacterial pathogen.

# INTRODUCTION

The remarkable ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to adapt to and thrive in a wide variety of environments contributes significantly to the ability of this bacterium to cause various human infections (Bodey et al.,1983;Holder,1993；Pier, 2002).Unlike most human pathogens possessing highly restricted host ranges,P.aeruginosa is pathogenic not only to humans,but also to Caenorhabditis elegans,Drosophila and Arabidopsis thaliana (Rahme et al.,1995;D'Argenio et al.,2001; Aballay & Ausubel,2002). This broad host range is contributed in part by the numerous virulence factors encoded by $P$ ，aeruginosa,including exotoxin A,phospho lipase C,alkaline protease, elastase,alginate, pyocyanin, pili andnon-pilusadhesins (Ramphal etal.,1991;Dereticet al., 1995；Lory & Strom，1997；Vasil & Ochsner，1999).P. aeruginosa, like many other Gram-negative animal and plant pathogens, also encodes a type III secretion machinery, where over 30 proteins assemble into a complex designed to deliver effector molecules directly into the cytoplasmic compartment of eukaryotic cells(Yahr et al.,1995;Frank, 1997).Injection of the bacterial effector molecules into the host cells results in various physiological changes,all of which seem to confer a survival advantage on the bacterial pathogen within the host environment (Hueck,1998; Muller et al.,2oo1).In animal pathogens, the principal function of the type II secretion system（TTSS） is to deliver anti-host virulence determinants into mammalian cells,thus not only evading the host's immune system,but also acquiring essential nutrients.Similarly,plant pathogens utilize TTSS to cause disease in susceptible plants and to trigger a hypersensitive response in resistant plants (Hueck,1998; Muller et al.,2001).

TTSS of $P _ { \cdot }$ 、aeruginosa responds to various environmental signals,such as low calcium and direct contact with tissueculture cells (Yahr et al.,1995; Frank,1997).Upon activation,the type II secretion apparatus translocates effector molecules into the cytoplasm of host cells,resulting in cell rounding and lifting and cell death by necrosis or apoptosis (Finck-Barbancon et al.,1997;Pederson et al., 1999;Kaufman et al.,2ooo).There are four known effector molecules,including ExoS and ExoT,two homologous toxins with both ADP-ribosyltransferase and GTPaseactivating protein activities,an acute cytotoxin，ExoU, with lipase activity,and an adenylate cyclase,ExoY (Yahr et al.,1996,1998；Finck-Barbancon et al.,1997；Hauser et al.,1998;Sato et al.,2005).It is well known that ExoS preferentiallyADP-ribosylates several Ras familymembers (GTP-binding proteins） required for the regulation of intracellular vesicle transport,cell proliferation and differentiation (Coburn & Gill, 1991;Ganesan et al.,1998). The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoS has also been shown to be essential in triggering programmed cell death in various types of tissue-culture cells(Kaufman et al.,2oo0; Jia et al.,2003).

The type I secretion complex of $P _ { \cdot }$ 、aeruginosa is highly similar to that of members of the genus Yersinia and,when expressed in cells of this genus,the ExoS protein can be translocated into mammalian cells via the yersinia TTSS (Frithz-Lindsten et al.,1997,1998).Both organisms harbour multiple regulators to tightly control the expression of the large type III secretion gene clusters in response to lowcalcium environmental stimuli.The mechanism by which the extracellular calcium concentration is translated into a transcriptional signal remains a mystery.In $P .$ ，aeruginosa, the expression of type III-related genes is regulated coordinately by a transcriptional activator,ExsA(Yahr & Frank,1994; Hovey & Frank,1995).ExsA is a DNA-binding protein that recognizes a consensus sequence (TNAAAANA) located approximately 51-52 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site to stimulate the expression of type II genes, including the exsA gene itself.More recently,a number of genes have been shown to affect the expression of type II genes,including adenylcyclase(cyaA),pseudouridinase (truA) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (aceAB) (Dacheux et al., 2002; Wolfgang et al., 2003; Ahn et al.,2004). Meanwhile, the type III genes are also regulated negatively by ExsD, the RhlI/RhlR quorum-sensing system and stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS (McCaw et al.,2002;Hogardt et al., 2004).

In this report,we describe the finding that optimal secretion of P.aeruginosa type III effector molecules requires a protein factor,designated type II secretion factor(TSF),in addition to the calcium chelator.The TSFs in L broth and serum were identified as caseins and albumin,respectively.Further analysis revealed that low-affinity calcium-binding proteins have TSF activity,whilst high-affnity calcium-binding proteins do not. Significance of the current finding in understanding the pathogen-host interaction is discussed.

$2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } ~ \mathrm { S m } ~ \mathrm { m l } ^ { - 1 }$ and $5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } ~ \mathrm { S p } ~ \mathrm { m l } ^ { - 1 }$ for Escherichia coli.All of the calcium-binding proteins used in this study were purchased from Sigma.

Activation of TTSS and detection of ExoS-FLAG by Western blot. In 24-well plates,each well was filled with $3 6 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium(DMEM) plus $5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EGTA and $1 \%$ fetal calf serum(FCS）or $1 0 \%$ L broth containing ${ 1 0 } ^ { 8 }$ bacterial cells from fresh overnight cultures.After $^ 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ incubation at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ina $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator,ExoS-FLAG secreted into the culture supernatant orintracellular ExoS-FLAG was detected by Western blot analysis. Secreted proteins in the culture supernatant were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid（TCA） to $1 5 \%$ and kept on ice for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The precipitated proteins from $2 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ supernatant were collected by centrifugation,washed three times with acetone,resuspended in $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE.Equal loading was based on samples from the same number of bacterial cells.Protein bands were transferred onto a PVDF membrane by using a Bio-Rad electroblotter and the membrane was blocked with $5 \%$ non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing $0 { \cdot } 1 \%$ Tween 20 (TBS-T） for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，followed by incubation with anti-FLAG $\mathrm { M } 2 \ \mathrm { m A b }$ (Sigma) for $1 ^ { . 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .ExoS-FLAG protein was then bound by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody and detected with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences).

Purification and quantification of secreted ExoS-FLAG. Strain PAKexoST/pHWoo29 was grown overnight in $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l } ~ \mathrm { L }$ broth supplemented with $5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EGTA.Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at $1 5 0 0 0 \ g$ for $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ and the culture supernatant was decanted into a new container with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate and kept at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight.Protein precipitates were recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ PBS. The protein sample was mixed with an anti-FLAG antibody and incubated at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } } { } _ { : }$ ，followed by an additional $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ incubation with O·1 vol. protein G-agarose. The beads were washed twice with PBS-Tbuffer ( $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ phosphate buffer, $1 5 0 \ \mathrm { m M \ N a C l }$ 0 $0 { \cdot } 2 \%$ BSA and $0 { \cdot } 0 5 \%$ Tween 20） and the bound ExoS-FLAG was eluted by adding $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ FLAG peptide $\mathrm { m l } ^ { - 1 }$ (Sigma） and reacting for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at room temperature with gentle agitation.The quantity of eluted ExoS-FLAG protein was measured by the bicinchoninic acid(BCA) protein-assay method.As a standard marker,serially diluted BSA solutions were reacted for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the BCA reagent mixture (Pierce). $ { A _ { 5 6 0 } }$ values of the reactions in the plates were measured to calculate the amount of ExoS-FLAG in the samples.The quantified ExoS-FLAG was also evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.

Sandwich ELISA for detection of ExoS-FLAG in bacterialculture supernatant. As capturing antibody,rabbit anti-ExoS antibody was diluted in $0 { \cdot } 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ carbonate buffer $\left( \mathrm { p H } \ 9 { \cdot } 6 \right)$ and used to coat 96-well microtitre plates (Nunc).After overnight incubation at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，the plates were washed three times with PBS-T and each well was blocked with $5 0 ~ \mu \textrm { l } 2 \%$ BSA(Sigma） in PBS for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The plates were then washed and $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ culture supernatant or positive control (serial dilutions of a known amount of purified ExoSFLAG) was applied to each well. The plates were incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ ，washed and then $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ mouse anti-FLAG $\mathrm { M } 2 \ \mathrm { m A b }$ (diluted 2000-fold in PBS-T）was added to each well.After incubation at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ and washing, $5 0 ~ \mu \mu \mu$ HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted in PBS-T was added to each well.The plates were incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ ，washed and then $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ citrate/phosphate buffer $\left( \mathrm { p H } 5 { \cdot } 0 \right)$ ）containing $\mid o \mid$ -phenylenediamine(OPD； Sigma）as peroxidase substrate was added together with $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ $A _ { 4 9 0 }$ was measured with an automated ELISA reader (Dynatech Laboratories) after $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ incubation at room temperature.Each sample was run in triplicate and the mean value of the $\boldsymbol { A } _ { 4 9 0 }$ readings for the triplicatewells was taken.The amount of ExoS-FLAG in each sample was determined by using a standard curve generated with a known amount of serially diluted ExoS-FLAG protein.ExoS in culture supernatants is shown as $\mathrm { { n g \ m l ^ { - 1 } } }$ in all figures.

Isolation of type Ill activating factor. To identify the active fraction of the TSF from serum and L broth,the samples were separated into $< 1 0$ ，10-50,50-100 and $> 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { k D a }$ fractions by using corresponding molecular mass cut-off membrane filters (Amicon).A gel-filtration column (Bio-Rad Bio-Silect SEC 250-5, $3 0 0 \times 7 { \cdot } 8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ） was further used for fractionation of serum and L broth on an HPLC system (Bio-Rad BioLogic DuoFlow system)，using $0 { \cdot } 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ sodium phosphate, $0 { \cdot } 1 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ N a C l , ~ p H ~ } 6 { \cdot } 8 ,$ as the mobile phase.Each fraction was tested for the ability to activate ExoS-FLAG secretion by sandwich ELISA.A $4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ aliquot of each fraction was added to $3 6 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ DMEM containing $5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EGTA and ${ 1 0 } ^ { 8 }$ cells of PAKexoST/ $\mathsf { p H W 0 0 2 9 }$ in 24-well plates.After incubating for $^ 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ina $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator, $5 0 ~ \mu \mu \mu$ aliquots of samples were subjected to sandwich ELISA as described above.

Other methods.A standard $\beta$ -galactosidase assay (Miller,1972) wasconducted to determine the expression ofexoS::lacZ, $e x s A : : l a c Z$ and exoT:: lacZ fusion genes.Standard methods were used for plasmid DNA preparation,restriction-enzyme digestion and cloning (Sambrook et al.,1989).

# RESULTS

# Triggering of type Ill secretion independently of type lll gene expression

Expression of the $P .$ 、aeruginosa type II secretion genes is known to be activated by either a low-calcium growth environment or direct contact with the host cells.To understand the dynamics of type III gene expression and secretion,we tested the expression patterns of the type III secretion genes during overnight culture of $P .$ aeruginosa in L broth,which we typically used to infect HeLa cells or subculture into a type III-inducing medium for type III secretion analysis.Plasmids with transcriptional fusions of exoS,exoT or exsA promoter and promoterless lacZ were introduced individually into a wild-type $P .$ aeruginosa strain, PAK,and $\beta$ -galactosidase activities were monitored in the resulting strains.As shown in Fig.1(a-c),expression of exoS:: lacZ $\mathrm { ( p H W 0 0 0 5 ) }$ ，exoT:: lacZ (pHW0006） and exsA::lacZ(pHWoo32）decreased from basal level,then increased gradually after $^ 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ culture and reached relatively high levels by $1 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ even in the absence of EGTA,although much higher levels were reached in the presence of EGTA. Despite the high basal level after $1 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ culture without EGTA, no secretion of ExoS or ExoT was observed when the culture supernatants were tested by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, left column),suggesting that either their intracellular levels did not reach certain required thresholds or that EGTA is essential for secretion.In the presence of EGTA,a high level of ExoS secretion was observed (Fig.2, left column). The overnight cultures from L broth were washed once with PBS and resuspended in a type Il-inducing medium $( \mathrm { D M E M } + 1 \%$ $\mathrm { F C S } + 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EGTA）with 10-fold dilution. Within the first $^ 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ incubation at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ expression of the three reporter genes decreased,indicating no active production of the type III secretion components in the early adaptive-growth phase (Fig. ld-f).However,within the same time frame,active secretion ofExoS was observed (Fig.2,right column),suggesting that pre-existing ExoS was secreted in the initial stage.These results further suggested that there is no requirement for a certain threshold level of intracellular ExoS for active secretion; instead,the presence of EGTA seems essential for the secretion,even before active expression of the type III genes. The ExoT secretion pattern was very similar to that of ExoS (data not shown).

Overnight cultures of the bacterial cells grown in L broth were washed in PBS and inoculated into $3 ~ \mathsf { m l }$ fresh L broth or DMEM plus $1 \%$ FCS with or without $5 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ EGTA with 10-fold dilution，and grown with or without $5 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ EGTA in a $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ without shaking. $\beta$ -Galactosidase activities were measured at indicated times after incubation. Mean values of triplicate assays are shown.

# Secretion of type Ill effector ExoS requires both EGTA and factors from serum or L broth

As shown above,secretion of ExoS and ExoT requires EGTA inboth L broth and tissue-culture medium $( \mathrm { D M E M } + 1 \%$ FCS)；however,almost no ExoS or ExoT secretion was observed when the bacterial cells were grown in minimal mediumA（MinA)（Davis&Mingioli,1950) supplemented with $5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EGTA ornitrilotriacetic acid(NTA)(data not shown).To identify the essential components for ExoS secretion present in the tissue-culture medium and L broth, strain PAKexoT was grown in various combinations of culture media and Western blot analysis was carried out to detect ExoS in the culture supernatants (for secretion） and bacterial-cell lysates (for its overall expression).Remarkably, in the presence of calcium chelator EGTA or NTA,ExoS secretion was not detectable in DMEM without FCS, whereas supplementation with serum or L broth resulted in the secretion of a high level of ExoS(Fig.3).Likewise, addition of serum or L broth to MinA restored ExoS secretion in the presence of the calcium chelators (data not shown),suggesting that serum and L broth contain factors essential for ExoS secretion.

To identify the TSFs present in serum and L broth,a highly sensitive sandwich ELISA system was developed to accuratelyquantify the secretedExoS.The sandwichELISA involves: (i) coating a 96-well plate with a polyclonal rabbit anti-ExoS antibody (capture Ab); (ii) incubating the 96-well plate with culture supernatant of PAKexoST/pHW0029, where pHWo029 encodes an ExoS-FLAG fusion that can be secreted effectively through the type III secretion apparatus (Fig. 4a-c); (iii) binding of the captured ExoS-FLAG with mouse anti-FLAG ${ \mathrm { M } } 2 { \mathrm { ~ m A b } }$ ；(iv）detecting with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate; and (v） developing the colorimetric reaction by the addition of substrate OPD (Fig.4d). Specificity of the sandwich ELISA assay was confirmed by comparison of the assay results with those of the Western blot using anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Fig. 4e-f).To test the sensitivity of the ELISA assay,ExoS-FLAG protein was purified from the culture supernatant of PAKexoST/ $\mathrm { p H W 0 0 } 2 9$ using anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-agarose (see Methods).Based on the analysis of a known amount of purified ExoS-FLAG protein,this ELISA system can detect ExoS-FLAG in culture supernatant from $1 2 0 \ \mathrm { n g \ m l ^ { - 1 } }$ to $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } ~ \mathrm { m l } ^ { - 1 }$ in a linear fashion and the assay system is highly reproducible (Fig. 4g).

Fig.2.Expression and secretion of ExoS under type Illinducing conditions. $P .$ aeruginosa strain PAKexoT grown for $1 5 \ h$ in L broth with or without $5 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ EGTA was subjected to ExoS analysis (left column).Bacterial cells grown for $1 5 \ h$ in L broth without EGTA were washed in PBS and resuspended in type Ill-inducing medium (DMEM plus $1 \%$ FCS and $5 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ EGTA)with 10-fold dilution.After 1,2,3 and $4 h$ incubation in a $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } .$ ，the cultures were subjected to ExoS analysis (right column).Bacterial-cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE( $1 2 \%$ gel)and (a) stained with Coomassie blue or (b)blotted with an anti-ExoS antibody.(c)Secreted ExoS was precipitated with $1 5 \%$ TCA，separated by SDS-PAGE L $( 1 2 \%$ gel)and detected by Western blot using an anti-ExoS antibody.

By using the newly developed ExoS-FLAG detection system, the requirement of EGTA andL broth or FCS for type III secretion was further investigated.As shown in Fig.5, secretion of ExoS-FLAG by $\mathrm { P A K } e x o S T / \mathrm { p H W } 0 0 2 9$ was observed only when EGTA and L broth or EGTA and serum were present together,whilst individual components of EGTA or L broth or serum alone were not sufficient, confirming the presence of serum and L broth factors that trigger type III secretion.ExoS-FLAG secretion was seen only in PAK/pHW0029 and PAKexoST/pHW0029 strains, but notin PAKexsA/pHWo029,a strain defective in type III secretion gene activation (Fig.5),demonstrating a TTSSspecific phenomenon.Here,we designate the serum and L broth factors as type III secretion factors (TSFs).

# TSFs in serum and L broth are protein molecules

TSFs in serum and L broth were further characterized by quantitative analysis of the secreted ExoS-FLAG by using the sandwich ELISA system.First,heat stability of the TSF was tested.Boiling did notinactivate the TSF activity ofFCS or L broth; instead,the TSF activities increased slightly, indicating that TSF is a heat-stable molecule,possiblya lowmolecular-mass compound.Next, the molecular mass range of the TSF was estimated.FCS and L broth were subjected to filtration through a $1 0 \ \mathrm { k D a }$ molecular mass cut-off Amicon filter membrane.To our surprise,the TSF activity was found in the high-molecular-mass fraction ( $\mathrm { \Phi > 1 0 ~ k D a }$ .Upon further separation of the high-molecular-mass components by Amicon filters with molecular mass cut-offs of 50 and

Fig.4.Evaluation of the sandwich ELISAassay system.PAKexoSTand PAKexsA harbouring an exoS-Flag fusion construct （204号 $\left( \mathsf { p H W 0 0 2 9 } \right)$ were grown in L broth in the presence $( + )$ or absence $( - )$ of $5 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ EGTA for $^ { 3 \mathfrak { h } }$ and culture supernatants were precipitated with $1 5 \%$ TCA.Precipitated proteins,as well as purified ExoS-FLAG protein $( 0 { \cdot } 5 ~ \mu \ g )$ ,were subjected to SDSPAGE $( 1 2 \% 9 \mathsf { e l } )$ and stained with Coomassie blue (a)or bloted with either a mAb against the FLAG tag (b)ora polyclonal antibodyagainst ExoS(c).Asandwich ELISAassay was developed forthedetectionof ExoS-FLAG inculture supernatants. Anti-ExoSand anti-FLAG were used ascaptureand detectionantibodies，respectively(d).Culture supernatants of PAKexoST/pHWo029 grown in DMEM with indicated supplements for $3 h$ have been subjected to Western blot using the anti-ExoS antibody(e)orsandwich ELISA(f) tomonitorsecreted ExoS-FLAG protein.A standard curve corelating the $A _ { 4 9 0 }$ （204号 values and the quantity of the ExoS-FLAG protein is also shown (g).

$1 0 0 \ \mathrm { k D a }$ ，the TSF activity of serum was mainly associated with $> 5 0 \ \mathrm { k D a }$ fractions,whereas that of L broth was associated with $1 0 { - } 5 0 \ \mathrm { k D a }$ fractions(Fig.6a)． These observations apparently contradict the heat-stability data, posing the possibility of small-molecular-mass compounds embedded within the high-molecular-mass molecules.To test this possibility,serum and L broth were fractionated after boiling for $5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Again,the TSF activity remained associated with the original size fractions.We then tested the sensitivity of the TSF to protease treatment.Fractionated FCS and L broth were subjected to protease treatment, then supplemented into $\mathrm { D M E M } + 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EGTA and used for the ExoS-FLAG secretion assay.As shown in Fig. 6(b),protease treatment completely abolished TSF activityin serumas well as in L broth, suggesting that the TSF is protein in nature.

FCS was further subjected to size fractionation by using an HPLC HR 5/5 column and each fraction was assayed for TSF activity.As shown in Fig.6(c),the TSF activity of FCS was associated with a single peak in the HPLC fraction,which had a $6 5 ~ \mathrm { { k D a } }$ major protein band on a Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. Both N-terminal amino acid sequencing and matrix-assistedlaserdesorption/ionization-time offlight mass-spectrometry analysis following trypsin digestion determined the protein to be BSA.Commercially available BSA was then tested for TSF activity. Indeed, pure BSA had all of the observed features of the serum TSF:high TSF activity，heat stability and protease sensitivity.Dosedependent TSF activities of FCS and BSA were further verified.As seen from Western blots in Fig.7,the intracellular levels of type III effector molecule ExoS were similar within the initial $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ culture in DMEM containing $5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EGTA at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (Fig.7a).However,the secreted form of ExoS was only seen in the presence of FCS or BSA in a concentration-dependent manner(Fig.7b-c),further confirming the TSF function of albumin in serum.Human serum albumin (HSA）also showed a high TSF activity (Fig. 8a).

To see whether there is any other component besides BSA that exhibits TSF activity,BSA was depleted from FCS by absorbing the BSA through a Blue-Gel affinity column or by using an anti-BSA antibody linked to agarose beads. The BSA-depleted FCS almost completely lost TSF activity, demonstrating that BSA is the major component in FCS that functions as a TSF (Fig.8b). In a control experiment, incubation of the FCS with anti-HSA antibody-agarose conjugate did not affect the TSF activity of the FCS (Fig. 8b), as anti-HSA antibody does not cross-react with BSA.

# Caseins in L broth function as TSFs

Size fractionation of L broth by HPLC showed multiple fractions with TSF activity (Fig.6d).As the protein components in L broth come from yeast extract and tryptone，we traced the TSF activities of these two components.Interestingly,both yeast extract and tryptone showed TSF activities,with tryptone being more active (data not shown).As tryptone is a pancreatic-digest product of caseins,the result indicated that TSF activity is associated with peptide fragments derived from caseins. Confirming this prediction,casein protein obtained from a commercial source(Sigma) had not onlyhigh TSF activity,but also heatstable and protease-sensitive characters.Dose-dependent TSF activities ofL broth and caseins were also verified.As seen from Western blots in Fig.7,ExoS secretion was only seen in the presence of L broth or casein in a concentrationdependent manner, further confirming the TSF function of the caseins.

The casein complexes of all species contain two types of proteins: the $a -$ and $\beta$ -caseins,which bind calcium and aggregate,and $\kappa$ -casein，which does not bind calcium, but stabilizes the $\alpha$ -and $\beta$ -caseins to yield the micelle or colloid (Swaisgood,1993).Pure individual casein protein components,α-, $\beta$ -and $\kappa$ -caseins,were obtained froma commercial source (Sigma） and tested for their TSF activities.As shown in Fig.8(a),both $a -$ and $\beta$ -caseins showed high TSF activity, but $\kappa$ -casein lacked TSF activity, suggesting the possible involvement of $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding ability in TSF activity.Depletion of the $\beta$ -casein from whole casein by using an anti- $\beta$ -casein antibody linked to agarose beads did not eliminate the TSF activity,presumably due to the presence of $\alpha$ -casein.However,adsorption of the $\beta$ -casein through anti $\beta$ -casein antibody-agarose abolished the TSF activity (Fig.8c)，demonstrating that individual casein proteins function as TSFs.

# Low-affinity, high-capacity $\pmb { C } \pmb { a } ^ { 2 + }$ -bindingproteins display TSF activity

There is no apparent amino acid sequence similarity or common structural motif between albumin and casein proteins; thus,the TSF function may involve certain physical properties.One common feature of albumin and casein is theirlow-affinity， high-capacity bindingofcalcium (Aguanno & Ladenson，1982；Swaisgood，1993；Vorum et al.，1995；Farrell et al.，2002).To test whether the $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding property is associated with the TSF activity, we surveyed a number of well-studied $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins, including high- and low-affinity $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins. Calcium-binding proteins localized within the cytoplasm(CaBP,CaM,troponin and S1oo),membraneanchored (calreticulin and annexin V） and secreted (albumin,casein and $\alpha$ -lactalbumin）have been tested.As shown in Fig.9,albumin,casein, $\alpha$ -lactalbumin and calreticulin, representing low-affinity ${ \mathrm { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins, showed high TSF activities,whereas annexin V,CaBP,CaM and S100,representing high-affinity ${ \mathrm { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins, exhibited no TSF activity,with the exception of troponin. Troponin is composed of three subunits, $\mathrm { C } , \mathrm { ~ I ~ }$ and $\mathrm { T }$ of which the C subunit is known to have a high-affinity $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ bindingability (Farah& Reinach,1995;Borovikov,1999). Tests of individual subunits of the troponin demonstrated that the TSF activity is not associated with the C subunit; rather,it is associated with the T subunit (Fig.9).Recently, the troponin T from avian flight muscle has been shown to have a $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding activity (Zhang et al., 2004). These data together suggested that low-affinity $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins possess TSF activity，although the reason for requirement of this calcium-binding property for TSF activity is not clear.

# DISCUSSION

TTSS of $P .$ ，aeruginosa is highly sensitive to environmental conditions,such as temperature, $\mathrm { \ p H }$ and ${ \mathrm { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ level, as well as metabolic balance(Yahr etal.,1995;Dacheux et al.,2002; Rietsch et al.,2004). In this study,we have shown that type II secretion requires specific signals.When grown overnight in L broth without EGTA,high intracellular levels of the type III effector molecules are accumulated without being secreted.However,addition of TSF and EGTA triggered type II secretion even before the activation of type I gene expression,indicating that active expression of the type III genes,which occurs after $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ culture (non-shaking in a $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ incubator),is not a prerequisite for active secretion and that initial secretion involves pre-existing ExoS molecules. Interestingly,both TSF and EGTA are also required for high-level expresson of type III secretion genes by $1 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ culture(Fig.1,left column),thus posing the possibility that type II secretion genes are activated through a secretion-dependent feedback mechanism.Indeed,presence of a functional type III secretion apparatus has been shown to be essential for type II gene expression (Yahr et al.,1996;

Vallis etal.,1999).Also,in yersiniae,a feedback regulation has been reported, where the expression of type III genes is lower in type III apparatus-defective mutants. Such feedback control is achieved by secretion of a TTSS-specific suppressor,LcrQ. In the presence of a functional type III secretion apparatus,LcrQ is secreted out of the cell and thus is no longer able to block the expression of TTSS genes, resulting in increased transcription of the TTSS components (Pettersson et al.,1996).Although no LcrQ homologue was found from the genome sequence of P.aeruginosa, data from this study,as well as others (Ménard etal.,1994; Yahr et al., 1996; Vallis et al., 1999),suggest the presence of a functional homologue of LcrQ.

To identify factors affecting the TTSS,we have established a sensitive sandwich ELISA system for the detection of secreted ExoS-FLAG and optimized in vitro type III-inducing conditions.To test multiple samples at once,bacterial cells were grown in multiwell plates and the culture supernatants were transferred into 96-well microtitre assay plates for direct quantification of secreted ExoS-FLAG.This method of ExoS detection has several advantages over conventional Western blot analysis; first, the assay does not require concentration of the bacterial-culture supernatant; second, it can accurately quantify the amount of secreted ExoS-FLAG protein; and third,hundreds of samples can be assayed at once.With this sensitive and high-throughput assay system,we were able to pursue the mysterious TSF in serum and L broth. This assay system has also proven to be a powerful tool in screening transposon insertional mutant banks for altered type III secretion patterns,which otherwise were impossible to screen for a large number of mutants by using Western blot analysis (J.Kim & S.Jin,unpublished results).

Serum albumin is an abundant,multifunctional protein.It is the major protein component of blood plasma, present at a concentration of around $0 { \cdot } 6 \ \mathrm { m M }$ ,but can also be found in bodily tissues and secretions.The protein binds calcium, but its primary role is to transport fatty acids.BSA is a heartshaped, monomeric protein of $6 5 ~ \mathrm { { k D a } }$ and,upon denaturation,it assumes an L-shaped form (Curry et al.,1999). Calcium binding by albumin is a complex process characterized by multiple binding sites whose affnity and binding capacity are variable,depending on parameters such as temperature, $\mathrm { \ p H }$ and ion strength (Fogh-Andersen,1977; Besarab et al.,198l;Kragh-Hansen & Vorum,1993).In previous reports,serum has been shown to be essential for the activation of TTSSs of members of the genera Shigella, Salmonella and Yersinia (Ménard etal.,1994;Zierler& Galan,1995; Lee et al.,2001) and BSA was shown to trigger type II secretion in yersiniae(Lee et al.,2Ool).Based on the similarities among the TTSSs of these organisms and P.aeruginosa,it is likely that the albumin in serum is required for the activation of TTSSs in these bacteria.Also, interestingly,two previous reports have demonstrated a role of BSA and caseins in facilitating the secretion of ATP-utilizing enzymes by mucoid P. aeruginosa, as well as Mycobacterium bovis,to the surrounding medium(Zaborina et al., $1 9 9 9 \mathrm { a }$ ，b)．Relevance of this observation to the activation of type II secretion is not clear.

In eukaryotic cells,cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in a resting state are low $( \overset { \cdot } { 1 } 0 ^ { - 8 } - 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \mathrm { M } )$ ,whilst extracellular concentrations are high $( 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ \mathrm { M } )$ . Accordingly, intracellular $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins have high binding strengths （204 $( \log K = 7 )$ ），whilstextracellular $\mathrm { C a } ^ { \sum + }$ -binding proteins have low binding strengths $( \log K = 3 - 4 )$ ）(Vogel,2002). Structurally,a major family of calcium-binding proteins is the‘EF-hand' superfamily,so called because they all contain the ‘EF-hand'helix-loop-helix $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding motif. Classical EF-hand proteins include calmodulin,parvalbumin and troponin C,whilst non-classical EF-hand proteins include the S1oo protein family and calbindins (Persechini et al., 1989;Berchtold,1993).However,no common structural motifs have been identified among low-affinity $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ _ binding proteins.As low-affinity $\bar { \mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + } }$ -binding proteins displayed TSF activity，regardless of their amino acid sequences, this implies the possible involvement of $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ ， binding activity in regulation of type III secretion. This also explains the observation that yeast extract also contains TSF molecules,as all living organisms encode low-affinity ${ \mathrm { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins. Efforts are under way to identify the minimal functional peptide fragments with TSF activity, with the hope to understand the features essential for TSF function, especially the requirement for a low-affinity $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ ， binding ability.The observation that high-affinity $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ _ binding proteins do not have TSF activity suggests that intracellular $P$ 、aeruginosa is unlikely to secrete type III effectors,which might increase the intracellular life span of the bacteria once inside the host cells.

The process of translocation is contact dependent and occurs without secretion to the surrounding medium during infection of eukaryotic cells (Rosqvist et al.,1994). Translocation has therefore been described as polarized,i.e. secretion takes place only at the zone of contact between the pathogen and the host cell. Based on the fact that many lowaffinity $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins function as TSFs,the TSFlike molecules are probably abundant in host tissues,even on the host-cell surface; however, a low- ${ \mathrm { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ environment is only found in the microenvironment surrounding hostcell surfaces or host cytosol (Heizmann & Berchtold,1987; Vogel,2002).Therefore,through co-evolution with its hosts, $P _ { \cdot }$ .aeruginosa may have chosen abundant host proteins (lowaffinity $\mathrm { \dot { C } a } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins) as TSF molecules to perceive the host environment while sensing high- or low $\cdot \mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ environments to distinguish distal vs proximal to the hostcell surface, ensuring type III injection into host cels rather than wasting into the surrounding tissues.

The requirement of TSF and EGTA for TTSS effector secretion indicates the existence of bacterial cell-surface component(s) interacting with the TSF,possibly in a Ca²+ concentration-dependent manner.In members of the genus Yersinia, three proteins,YopN,LcrG and TyeA,are involved in preventing secretion in vitro into $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ -containing media and the surrounding culture media during infection of eukaryotic cells. Strains mutated for any of these genes display de-repressed Yop expression and secretion in vitro, i.e.high levels of expression and secretion are seen, irrespective of the $\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ concentration (Forsberg et al., 1991;Nilles et al.，1997；Day & Plano，1998;Cheng & Schneewind，2000；Matson & Nilles，2001).Differing from the genus Yersinia,mutation in the pcrV gene of P.aeruginosa has been shown to result in constitutive secretion of type II effector molecules (Sawa et al.,1999; McCaw et al.,20o2).However，no interactions between $\mathrm { P c r } \mathrm { V }$ and the identified TSF molecules were observed (J.Kim & S. Jin,unpublished results),suggesting alternative target molecules for the TSF.Efforts are under way to identify the TSF-binding bacterial cell-surface component(s） involved in the control of type II secretion.
