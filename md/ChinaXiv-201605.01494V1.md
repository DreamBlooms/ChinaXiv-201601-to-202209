Abstract: The signal transduction pathway initiated by vascular endothelial growth factor-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-VEGFR2) plays an important role in the angiogenesis of tumors.The effective antagonists of VEGFR2 would behave as potent drugs for the treatment of malignantcancers.Inour study,specific binding peptides with high affinityto VEGFR2 wereobtained through bacterial display technology.Conserved motif (FF/YEXWGVK） among those peptide sequences was discovered. One of the selected peptides,VRBP1(YDGNSFYEMWGVKPASES)was identified by screning the biased bacterial peptide library andits physiochemical feature was further characterized.The results of surfaceplasmonresonance (SPR)assy indicated that the dissociation constant $( K _ { \mathrm { D } } )$ value of VRBP1 was $2 2 8 . 3 \ \mathrm { n M }$ and this peptide competed with VEGF binding to VEGFR2.Particles conjugated with VRBPl could recognize the human umbilical vein endothelial cels (HUVEC) which express VEGFR2 on the surface.Further therapeutic effect of VRBPl was examined byin vivo experiments.VRBP1 could result in a significant decrease in tumor size of $_ { \mathrm { H } 4 6 0 }$ xenografts. The results from the immunohistochemical assay showed that CD3l positive signals in VRBP1-treated group were fewer than those in the control ones.These data highlighted the potential of VEGFR2-binding peptides as effective molecules for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

# INTRODUCTION

Angiogenesis is a normal process occurring during embryonic and post-embryonic development, reproductive cycle and wound repair.Now,many data have shown that angiogenesis plays a critical role in cancer development, especially in the rapid growth of solid tumors beyond 1-2 mm in diameter and metastatic tumors [1,2]. Studies on cancer patients have shown a direct correlation between the density of tumor vessels and an adverse prognosis [3,4],so the development of specific anti-angiogenic agents arises as an attractive approach for the treatment of cancer and other angiogenesis-dependent diseases [4]. Vascular endothelial growth factor（VEGF） asan endothelial cell-specific mitogen has been found to be the most important angiogenic factors in tumor angiogenesis [5-7]. VEGF functions by binding to one of its specific tyrosine kinase receptors: VEGFR1(fms-like tyrosine kinase/Flt1)[8-10],VEGFR2(a kinase insert domain-containing receptor/KDR) [10,11] and VEGFR3 (Flt-4）[12,13] to promote either physiologic or pathologic angiogenesis. Only homodimerization of VEGFR2 leads to a strong autophosphorylation and it exhibits a strong induction in angiogenesis [14,15],while VEGFRl participates in transduction of a weak angiogenic signal [14]. Furthermore, VEGFR2 is usually found to be aberrantly expressed or constitutively phosphorylated in tumors [16-18]. Recently, Sorafenib [18,19],an anti-VEGFR2 antagonist was introduced to the market for cancer treatment. Although antibodies targeting the different cancer-related molecules have already been used in cancer therapy successfully [2O], some targeting molecules such as peptides have presented numerous advantages over antibodies and may be used as substitutes for antibodies in future.For example,peptides have smaller sizes and better tissue penetration than antibodies, and coupling drugs or imaging agents with peptides is easier than that with antibodies [21,22].In addition,peptides represent alternatives to antibodies in terms of maximizing safety and minimizing production costs [21, 23].

Phage display technology or chemical synthesis has been successfully used to obtain the requisite peptides [24-26]. Several VEGFR2-binding peptides have been identified using phage display method [27,28],but no consensus sequences were discovered and their affinity and specificity to VEGFR2 still need to be improved for the clinical use. Therefore,it is necessary to develop more specific binding peptides to VEGFR2 with high affinity for cancer diagnosis and therapy.In our study，we applied bacterial display method to identify the specific binding peptides for extracellular domain of VEGFR2.Bacterial display method coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) technology is a simpler,more effective,high throughput and more quantitative approach to discover and optimize peptides comparing with phage display methods [29-31]. In this study，a specifically VEGFR2 binding peptide with moderate affinity was identified. It not only inhibited proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro,which express VEGFR2 on their surface [32],but also reduced the tumor growth of H460 xenografts in vivo.Therefore,this peptide has the potential to be used as an effective molecule for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

# Screening of Binding Peptides to VEGFR2 froma RandomLibrary

Biotinylation of VEGFR2 was performed using the FluoReporter mini-biotin-XX protein labeling kit (Invitrogen

Corp.，CA，USA，Cat No.F-6347） and following its instruction.A library of peptides with 15 randomized amino acids was used for screening the binding peptides to VEGFR2.Frozen aliquots of $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 }$ bacteria were thawed and cultivated overnight with shaking at $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ in super optimal broth（SOB) at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with $3 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ CMand $0 . 2 \%$ (w/v)D- $( + )$ -glucose added. The next day，bacteria were sub cultured at 1:5O in lysogeny broth (LB) medium supplemented with $3 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ CM for $2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ followed by induction with $0 . 0 2 \%$ $\bf ( w / v )$ L $( + )$ -arabinose for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ at room temperature to ensure peptides expressed on the surface of bacteria [33]. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was first performed with $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { \ n M }$ biotinylated VEGFR2 to reduce the library size and ratio of beads: bacteria was 1:2,as previously described[29,37].Afterwards, the library was incubated with biotinylated VEGFR2 at various concentrations from $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ for $4 5 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with or without co-incubated with $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ human IgG. After washing with $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, $\mathfrak { p H } ~ 7 . 4 )$ for three times and $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ $( 3 . 3 ~ \mathrm { n M } )$ SAPE was added into the tube,bacteria clones with high fluorescence intensity,meaning that peptides expressed on the bacteria surface could bind with VEGFR2,were sorted.These sorted bacteria clones were used for the next round of screening.

A few rounds of FACS were performed and when the fluorescent signals of bacteria stopped increasing in the two sequential rounds,i.e.,when the binding bacteria clones for VEGFR2 were fully enriched, the screening procedure for the binding peptides was terminated. Sorted bacteria with binding peptides were cultured on LB medium plate containing $1 \%$ agar and $3 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ CM.After culturing for $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,monoclonal bacteria were picked and cultured in $5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ SOB containing $3 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ CM at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight. The sequences of the peptides showed on these clones were obtained by sending these bacteria to Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China. for sequencing.

# Determination of Binding Activity for Peptides-Bacteria withVEGFR2

The preliminary examination of peptides-bacteria binding properties was performed under different treatment conditions: tough washing and serum or IgG blocking_during incubation process.Individual clones including $1 { \times } 1 \bar { 0 } ^ { 7 }$ bacteria induced by $0 . 0 2 \%$ (w/v) $\scriptstyle \mathrm { L - } ( + )$ -arabinose for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ at room temperature were incubated with $6 7 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ biotinylated VEGFR2 with or without $10 \%$ serum or $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ human IgG for $4 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ~ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ = The bacteria were centrifuged at $3 0 0 0 \times g$ for $5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ and washed with PBS. Sediments were resuspended in $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ SAPE and incubated for $2 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Prior to analysis, bacteria were centrifuged at $3 0 0 0 { \times } g$ for 5 min and resuspended in $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ PBS,with or without three extra washes.

The relative binding affinity ( $\mathrm { \Delta } K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ value) was estimated by formula $\mathrm { F l - F l _ { \mathrm { e C P X } } = F l _ { \mathrm { m a x } } }$ $[ \mathrm { P } ] / ( K _ { \mathrm { D } } \mathrm { + } [ \mathrm { P } ] )$ . Fl is the fluorescent value produced by individual bacteria clones incubated with VEGFR2. $\mathrm { F l _ { e C P X } }$ indicates the fluorescent intensities of eCPX bacteria after incubation with VEGFR2. $\mathrm { F l } _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ represents the highest fluorescent value of bacteria-VEGFR2 complex and [P] is the concentration ofVEGFR2.

# Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) with Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-Conjugated Peptides

VEGFR2（ $2 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in PBS buffer, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 4 \AA ,$ ）wascoated on 96-well plates $( 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu L / w e l l } )$ and kept at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ overnight. These wells were washed with PBS and then blocked with $3 \%$ BSA in PBS with $0 . 0 5 \%$ Tween20,forl h at room temperature. FITC-conjugated VRBP1 and control peptide (CONP，GSSGSSGSSGSSGSSGSSGSSGSSK)ata concentration of $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ in PBS were added and incubated at room temperature for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ .

The fluorescence microscopy experiment was carried out to examine the binding efficiency of synthesized FITC-conjugated peptides with attached HUVEC cells.HUVEC cells were seeded in 12-well plates (Costa, corning incorporated) at a density of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cell/well overnight and fixed with $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde at room temperature for $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ ． After washing,cells were blocked with a culture medium containing $5 \%$ BSA at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 10 min and then incubated with FITC-conjugated peptides in serum-free medium at $3 7 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ .The plates were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Diaphot, Nikon Corp.，Tokyo,Japan). The binding activity between synthesizedFITC-conjugatedpeptideswithdetached HUVEC cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cultured (48h post-seeding) HUVEC cells were harvested and resuspended in tubes. ${ 1 \times 1 0 } ^ { 7 }$ HUVEC cells were incubated with 0.5 nmol FITC-conjugated peptides for $4 5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ on an inversion shaker at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Cell suspensions were centrifuged at $3 0 0 \times g$ for $5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ~ { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and then washed three times with PBS.The sediment was resuspended with $1 \ \mathrm { m L }$ PBS and immediately analyzedbyFACS.

# Measurement of $K _ { \mathbf { D } }$ Values for Synthesized Peptides to VEGFR2

Dissociation constants of synthesized peptide were determined by SPR on a Biacore 30oO system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The HRBio sensor chip(SJ Biomaterials, Suzhou,China) was activated by a 1:1 solution of $0 . 4 \mathrm { ~ M ~ l ~ } \cdot$ ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimidein water (EDC） and O.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide in water (NHS) according to the manufacturer's instructions.VEGFR2(2-10 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ in $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ sodium acetate, $\mathrm { p H } ~ 5 . 5 \rangle$ ）was injected over the activated surfaces of flow cell 2 at a flow rate of 10 $\mu \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ until the target immobilization levels(2,000 response units for flow cell 2） were reached.Uncoupled receptors were removed and un-reacted moieties on the chip were blocked with $1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ ethanolamine-HCl $\mathrm { ( p H ~ } 8 . 5 \mathrm { ) }$ .Flow cell 1 was activated and blocked without exposure to VEGFR2 and served as background control surfaces for the binding interactions.

All kinetic binding experiments were performed at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ indegassed PBS running buffer(pH 7.4). Various concentrations (0.2,0.4, 0.5 and $1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ）ofpeptides were flowed through the surface-immobilized VEGFR2 at 10 $\mu \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ for $5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ and the binding events were monitored. Following association,the dissociation process of peptidereceptor complexeswasmonitored for $7 \mathrm { m i n }$ ：

# Examination of Competencebetween VEGF and Peptides Binding to VEGFR2 by SPR Assay

The HRBio sensor chip was activated by a 1:1 solution of EDC/NHS.The activated surfaces of flow cell2 were passed over by $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ VEGFR2 ata rate of $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L / m i n }$ until the 2000 response units (RU） were reached. After the immobilizationofVEGFR2， bindingpeptidesata concentration of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m L }$ were injected at a rate of 10 $\mu \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ followed by $3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ VEGF passed over at a rate of $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { L / m i n } }$ .In another chip,the $3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ VEGF was injected followed by $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ binding peptides passed over. The RU was monitored in real-time and presented in a sensorgram of RU versus time.

# Construction of Tumor Mice Models with Subcutaneous Xenograft

The nu/nu mice (female,3-4 weeks old) were obtained from Nanjing Sikerui Biological Technology Co.,Ltd.Mice were maintained under super pathogen-free conditions and housed in barrier facilities on a 12h light/dark cycle,with food and water ad libitum. The mice were maintained as per the principles and guidelines of the ethical committee for animal care in accordance with the China National Law on animal care and use.Cultured tumor cells(H46O)were implanted subcutaneously(sc) into the flanks of mice.When tumor volume reached $\dot { 2 } ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ ，mice were sacrificed and the tumor mass was divided into small pieces.A small tumor tissue about $2 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ was transplanted subcutaneously into the right leg of each mouse. One day later,mice were divided randomly into 2 groups, with four mice in each group.

# The TreatmentofMicewith Peptides

VRBP1 and CONP were dissolved in $0 . 9 \%$ physiological saline.One day after tumor xenograft was transplanted to mice, $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ VRBP1 $( 4 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ，CONP（ ${ \bf \zeta } 4 0 0 \ \mu \bf { g / m L } )$ or $0 . 9 \%$ physiological saline was injected to tumor sites subcutaneously every other day.After being injected for 11 times,mice were sacrificed and tumor tissues were put into

$4 \%$ paraformaldehyde for further experiments. During treatment, the tumor size was measured and recorded in two dimensions, and the volume was calculated using the formula: tumor volume $( \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 } ) = 1 / 2 \times$ length $( \mathrm { m m } ) \times$ width $\left( \mathrm { m m } \right) ^ { 2 }$ ·

# Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence-Like Assay

For immunohistochemistry assay,the fixed tumor tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned into slices as thin as $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ with a microtome.Tissue sectioned at $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ were deparaffinized in xylene,rehydrated through graded alcohol series,and subjected to immunohistochemistry assay with a monoclonal rabbit anti-mice CD31 antibody.Antigen retrieval was done in citric acid $\left( \mathrm { p H } 6 . 0 \right)$ at $9 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with $3 \%$ hydrogen peroxide for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ，and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with $5 \%$ BSA for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Primary antibody to CD31 was diluted at 1:10O in PBS.Next day, goatanti-rabbitimmunoglobulinantibodieslabeled with horseradish peroxidase were diluted at 1:5oo in PBS and incubated with sections for $4 5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Sections were incubated with diaminobenzidinechromogen substrate solution for $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ and counterstained with hematoxylin After that, sections were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse 55i microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-5M camera,using Image-Pro Plus acquisition software. $1 0 0 \times$ ， $2 0 0 \times$ and $4 0 0 \times$ images were acquired.

For immunofluorescence-like assay, tissue sections from mice xenograft were incubated with $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ FITClabeled peptides for $4 5 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ at room temperature after blocking with $1 \%$ BSA for $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ .After washing with PBS three times，tumor sections were observed under fluorescence microscope.

# Intratumormicrovessel Density (MVD) Accessment

MVD was assessed by light microscopic analysis for neovascular hot spots.Areas with neovascularization at the highest density were selected by scanning the tumor sections at low magnification ( $4 0 \times$ and $1 0 0 \times$ total magnification). Brown-staining microvessel countswere made ona $2 0 0 \times$ field ( $2 0 \times$ objective and $1 0 \times$ ocular,Nikon microscope). The value of MVD was represented with average microvessels in three $2 0 0 \times$ fields.

# Statistically Analysis

All these experiments were independently replicated for three or more times and the data were presented as mean $\pm$ standard deviation (S.D.). Comparisons were carried out usingStudent’st-test(MicrosoftExcel,Microsoft Corporation,USA). P-value $< 0 . 0 5$ was considered to be statistically significant.

# RESULTS

# Bacteria Clones Binding to VEGFR2 were Identified from a Fully Random Bacterial Peptide Library

To obtain the peptide sequences that bound specifically to VEGFR2，bacteria displaying a fully random 15-mer peptidelibrary $( \mathrm { X } _ { 1 5 } )$ wereincubatedwith VEGFR2. Bacterial libraries resulting from each cycle of screening were analyzed with flow cytometry to track enrichment. The sorting processes were carried out for 8 cycles including one round MACS(M1),and seven rounds of FACS selections. Initially，in the first two rounds of FACS selections,the concentrations of VEGFR2 were $5 0 \ \mathrm { n M }$ (R1）and $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ (R2),and percentages of bacteria in the sorting gate were $2 5 . 1 \%$ and $3 8 . 7 \%$ (Fig.1A),respectively.Subsequently, the sorting strategy was changed by increasing the stringency of sorting.Following the M1, the concentration of VEGFR2 in the following screening cycles (F1 to F7,Fig.1B) was decreased from $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ to $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ and $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ human IgG was added to the screening system.In the end,1oo clones were sent for sequencing and only seven independent binding peptidessequenceswere obtained (clonel-clone7).A consensus sequence of FF/YEXWGVK (Fig. 2A) was presented in most of theclones. Thepreliminary examination of the affinity and specificity of those peptides clones which were on the surface of bacteria for VEGFR2 was performed and in this in situ test,clone 1 and clone 2 kept higher fluorescent signals even under serum blocking and tough washing treatment compared with other clones (Fig.2B),which meant that these two clones might have higher binding affinity and specificity to VEGFR2. The apparent $K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ values of bacteria clone 1 and clone 2 to VEGFR2 were $2 8 7 . 7 \pm 0 . 9 8 8 \mathrm { \ n M }$ and $3 1 2 ~ \pm ~ 0 . 9 9 4 ~ \mathrm { { \ n M } }$ respectively (Fig. S1).

# VEGFR2 Binding Bacteria Clones with Higher Affinity and Specificity were Identified from Focused Library

In order to get higher affinity peptides and make them more suitable for application in clinic,a focused library was designed and constructed.On the N-terminus of enhanced CPX(eCPX) [33],a focused library was constructed with the form ZZZZZFF/YEXWGVKZZZZZ in which $Z$ stood for biased amino acids except forF,L,M,V,and I.PCR was performed with CGTAGCTGGCCAGTCTGGCCAGNVSN VSNVSNVSNVSTTYTTY/TAYGARNNSTGAGGNGTN AARNVSNVSNVSNVSNVSGGAGGGCAGTCTGGGCA GTCas the forward primer, GGCTGAAAATCTTCTCTC as the reverse primer and pB33eCPX-SApep [38] as a template. The PCR product was digested with $S f i \mathbf { I }$ and ligated into a similarly digested pB33CPX vector. The library size was $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ ：

Sorting experiments for VEGFR2 binding peptides were performed with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ biotinylated VEGFR2 and $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ human IgG.After 4 rounds of sorting,a series of binding clones out of 3O random ones containing the core sequences were obtained (Fig.2C).The preliminary examination of the affinityand specificity of those peptides-bacteria for VEGFR2 was performed with methods similar as part of ‘Determination of binding activity for peptides-bacteria with VEGFR2’in materials and methods section.Clone F5 and clone F11 (Fig. 2C） seemed to have relatively higher fluorescent signals compared with other clones which meant that these two clones might have high binding affinity to VEGFR2 (data not shown). The peptide displayed on clone F11(YDGNSFYEMWGVKPASES)was named as VRBP1 and that on clone F5 (RSRNAFFELWGVKRETPG) was named as VRBP2.VRBP1，VRBP2，consensus sequence FF/YEXWGVK (named as VRBCP) and CONP were synthesized with/without FITC conjugated at their N termini. The $K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ value of synthesized VRBP1 to VEGFR2 was 228.3 nM measured by SPR assay.And the results of ELISA indicated that VRBP1 could specifically bind to VEGFR2 (Fig. 2D).

# VRBP1 could Recognize VEGFR2 on HUVEC Cells and TumorVessels

To investigate physiochemical properties of peptides sorted from bacterial library， the VEFGR2 recognizing experiment was performed with VRBP1,VRBP2,VRBCP and CONP.Fig.3A showed that HUVEC cells emitted strong green fluorescent signals after incubation with FITCconjugated VRBP1 and VRBP2，while weaker fluorescent signals on HUVEC cells incubated with VRBCP were observed. The ignorable fluorescent signals were observed onHUVEC cells when incubated with CONP.

percentage of the HUVEC cells binding with fluorescent labeledVRBP1was $34 . 1 \%$ .HUVEC cells incubated with FITC-VRBP2 also showed reasonable high fluorescent signals,which indicated that peptides obtained from focus library could recognize HUVEC cells effectively. The percentage of the VRBCP-bound HUVEC cells was $23 . 2 \%$ while that with CONP was $5 \%$

Suspended HUVEC cells were also applied to examine the binding properties of peptides.As shown in Fig.3B, the

The binding efficiency and specificity of VRBP1 to VEGFR2 were further confirmed by the immunofluorescencelike assay with tumor sections. More green fluorescent signals were observed on the slides incubated with VRBP1, while there were ignorable signals shown up on the slides with CONP (Fig.3C).

# VRBP1-Beads could Specifically Attach to HUVEC Cells

Since peptide VRBP1 could bind with VEGFR2 with higher affinity,the examination of the targeting function of VRBP1 was performed. The carboxylic beads coupled with VRBP1 and CONP were incubated with the HUVEC and HLF cell lines respectively at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ .After washing for 3 times with PBS,huge amount of the beads conjugated with VRBP1 on the surface was observed to be accumulated on the surface of HUVEC cells and very few on HLF cells (Fig. 4A).Furthermore,very few of the beads conjugated with CONP were observed on both HLF and HUVEC cells (Fig.4A).These results indicated that the VRBPlcould be used as the targeting molecules for tumor vessels in which VEGFR2 was over-expressed.

# VRBP1 could Increase the Contrast Effect of MRI Examination

For verifying that the VRBP1 could work as the guiding molecule of imaging agents for cancer diagnosis, we conjugated VRBP1 and CONP with SPIO and incubated those particles with cells. The changes of magnetic signals on cells were detected with MRI machine.SPIO can produce a predominant T2 relaxation effect.SPIO-VRBP1 and SPIOCONP at various concentrations were internalized by HUVEC cells in vitro and monitored by MRI.As shown in Fig.4B,the T2-weighted signal intensity decreased with the increase of the iron concentration.The T2-weighted images ofHUVEC cells incubated with SPIO-VRBP1 appeared to be much darker than those of incubated with SPIO-CONP. Furthermore,the T2-weighted images of the HLF cells incubated with SPIO-VRBP1 showed non-changeable signals. The MRI results suggested that VRBPl could increase the particles uptake efficiency of HUVEC cells when particles were conjugated and VRBP1 might work as effective guiding molecules for blood vessels and tumors which overexpressedVEGFR2.

# VRBP1 could Competitively Bind to VEGFR2 with VEGFExaminedbySPRMethodandELISA

The original SPR readout for binding of $3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ VEGF with VEGFR2 was 200.8 RU (Fig.5A,red line). When 10 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ VRBP1 was introduced into the binding system before VEGF was added to the channel, the SPR readout of VEGF-VEGFR2 binding was decreased by 40 RU (Fig. 5A). If $3 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ VEGF was introduced into the reaction channel first before the addition of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m L }$ VRBP1，the SPR readout of VRBP1-VEGFR2 binding was decreased by around 34 RU (from 77.9 RU to 46.1 RU) (Fig. 5B). The results mightimply thatVRBP1 bound withVEGFR2 at the same or adjacent position where VEGF bound with VEGFR2, or at other locales which could interfere the binding of VEGF to VEGFR2.The results of ELISA experiment confirmed that VRBP1 could antagonize the binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 (Fig. S2).

# VRBP1 Specifically Inhibited the Proliferationof VascularEndothelial Cellsinvitro

The proliferation of endothelial cell proliferation is dependent on VEGF.Our data showed that the selected peptide VRBP1 could block VEGF binding to VEGFR2, therefore,it was necessary to examine the effect ofVRBP1 andVRBP2 on the proliferation ofHUVEC cells which overexpressed VEGFR2.As shown in Fig.6,VRBP1 significantly suppressed the mitogenic response of ${ \mathrm { r h V E G F } } _ { 1 6 5 }$ to HUVEC cells at a concentration of $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ . The less inhibitory effect on proliferation of HUVEC cells was observed by VRBP2 treatment.In order to verify the growth inhibition of VRBP1 that we observed in HUVEC cells,we performed similar experiments on HLF cells.The proliferation of HLF cells was not affected by VRBP1 (Fig. S3), indicating that the growth inhibitory effects of VRBP1 to HUVEC cells were not due to its potential cytotoxicity and the effect of peptides on HUVEC cells proliferation might be due to the blockade of the VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway by peptides.

# VRBP1 Suppressed Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis in vivo

To examine the effect of VRBPlon tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo, nu/nu mice with H46O tumor xenograft wereused.One day after tumor xenograft was transplanted to mice, $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ VRBP1 $( 4 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ or CONP ${ \bf \zeta } 4 0 0 \ \mu \bf { g / m L } )$ or physiological saline was injected to tumor sites. The growth of tumors was assessed every other day.Our results (Fig.7A) indicated that VRBP1 could decrease the growth of tumor after 15 days compared with CONP and physiological saline group. The average tumor size in VRBP1 treated mice was around $7 5 . 4 7 ~ \mathrm { \ m m } ^ { 3 }$ ，compared with $1 7 2 . 6 1 ~ \mathrm { \ m m } ^ { 3 }$ in CONP group and $2 2 0 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ in physiological saline group at21 days post injection (Fig.7B),which indicated VRBP1 could decrease tumor size significantly compared to CONP. The effects of VRBP1 on angiogenesis were examined by immunohistochemical experiment. Serial sections from the solid tumors of nude mice with different treatments were incubated with CD31 antibody. The immunohistochemical results showed that there were more CD31 positive vessels presented in the physiological saline and CONP-treated tumor xenograft slides than those in the VRBPl group (Fig 7C).Furthermore,sections from VRBP1 treated mice had a mean microvessel count of 221 per $2 0 0 \times$ field.For those sections from physiological saline and CONP treated mice, the corresponding value was 576 and 506 per $2 0 0 \times$ field (Fig. 7D).

# DISCUSSION

In our study,we successfully screened and selected the specific binding peptides for VEGFR2 with bacterial display method.Selected peptides in two different forms,peptidesbacteria and free peptides were characterized through examiningtheir specificityandaffinitytoVEGFR2.VRBP1 obtained from focused library had higher affinity ( $\mathrm { \Delta } K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ value was $2 2 8 . 3 \mathrm { n M }$ to VEGFR2 compared with the peptide (MAKGDFFERWGVKEM)（ $\mathrm { \Delta K _ { D } }$ value was $5 7 4 . 7 ~ \mathrm { n M }$ from random library by the SPR assay (data not shown),which indicated that focused library with conserved sequences could promote to get better binding peptides for VEGFR2. Although the $K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ value of peptide VRBP1 was not higher than that of antibodies,it was still in the acceptable range for the research and clinical usage.It could be understood since the molecular weight of peptides is smaller than that of antibodies, the force of hydrophobic between peptides and proteins may be weaker than that between antibodies and proteins [39].Although the affinity between VRBP1 and VEGFR2 was less strong than that between VEGF and VEGFR2 [40], the competitive binding between VRBP1 and VEGF to VEGFR2 was observed from SPR assay and confirmed by ELISA experiment.These results implied that VRBP1 might bind to VEGFR2 on the same or adjacent position as VEGF，which need to be verified in future. Through blocking the interaction between VEGFand VEGFR2，VRBP1 could defer the growth velocityof HUVEC cells,which meant that VRBP1 had the ability to block the function of VEGF on promoting the proliferation of HUVEC cells.Moreover, the tumor size and number of newly generated tumor vessels in the tumor xenograft models were reduced after the mice were injected with VRBP1.The results from these functional assays further proved that VRBP1 and VEGF competitively interacted with VEGFR2.Furthermore,we presented that VRBP1 could not only be used as therapeutic drugs for cancer patients potentially through inhibiting the growth of new vessels for cancers，but also for locale diagnosis of cancers after conjugating with SPIO.

Besides,peptides obtained from our study which could be used for cancer diagnosis and therapy,two robust tools were developed for the biotechnological research:1.Affinity evaluation could be performed directly with the peptides on the surface of bacteria;2.SPR method might substitute ELISA to examine the competitive relationship between various molecules.

Normally,isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)[41], microscale thermophoresis (MST) [42,43] and SPR [44] were often used to measure the $K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ value of one molecule to therespondingmolecule.However, thesuccessful measurement of these methods needs sophisticated machines and skillful technicians. In the preliminary section of the whole study,especially when the measurement objectives were very diverse, these methods were not suitable considering the cost and time. In our display system, peptides were displayed on the surface of bacteria,which could be considered as organism matrix.Provided that the expression level of any selected peptides on the bacteria surface was similar,when peptides-bacteria incubated with different concentrations of targeted fluorescent proteins, the fluorescent signals of bacteria had positive correlation with the binding rate between peptides and proteins.When we firstly designed this assay, the only thing expected was to get the relative comparative data about binding eficiency among different peptides with target proteins. Interestingly,from our data, the $K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ values for selected peptides-bacteria were in the same mathematical level compared with those of same selected synthesized peptides from SPR measurement. It might prompt us that we could use this novel method to evaluate the $K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ values of peptides to proteins.

As for the second useful tool developed from our study, we could use SPR method to substitute ELISA to examine the competitive relationship between different molecules to the same target.Antibodies and luminescent materials are the essential composites for ELISA experiments which implied that proteins/peptides need to be either labeled or used as luminescent antibodies in the system [45]. It is well known that SPR could be used to measure $K _ { \mathrm { D } }$ values between two different molecules without any labels [46].In theory，it could be used to examine the relationships between the two molecules when they could bind with the same target. However,there is no such report till now.In our study,we introduced the second molecule into the reaction channel when the first molecule finished interacting with the target protein without starting the washing procedure.The decreased reaction unit (SPR readout) presented between the second molecule and target proteins meant that these two molecules had competitive relationship binding to the target molecule. In our study,results from ELISA experiment and functional assays related to the peptides verified the validity of this method.

# CONCLUSION

Taken together,in our study，peptides obtained from bacterial display methods could serve as powerful tools for both cancer diagnosis and therapy.Further verification of application for those peptides in clinic needs to be done in future.Besides that, two biotechnological tools developed would benefit the research in this area. We do hope that results from our study would have profound scientific and applicable value in both research and clinical fields.
