# ABSTRACT

Dasatinib-based therapy is often used as a second-line therapeutic strategy for imatinib-resistance gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs); however,acquired aberrant activation of dasatinib target proteins, such as c-KIT and PDGFRβ,attenuates the therapeutic efficiency of dasatinib.Combination therapy which inhibits the activation of dasatinib target proteins may enhance the cytotoxicity of dasatinib in GISTs.

Bortezomib,a proteasome inhibitor,significantly inhibited cell viability and promoted apoptosis of dasatinib-treated GIST-T1 cells,whereas GIST-T1 cells showed litle dasatinib cytotoxicity when treated with dasatinib alone,as the upregulation of c-KIT caused by dasatinib itself interfered with the inhibitionof c-KITand PDGFRβ phosphorylation by dasatinib.Bortezomib induced internalization and degradation of c-KIT by binding c-KIT to Cbl,an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase,and the subsequent release of Apaf-1, which was originally bound to the c-KIT-Hsp9oβ-Apaf-1 complex,induced primary apoptosis in GISTT1 cels.Combined treatment with bortezomib plus dasatinib caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase through inactivation of PDGFRβ and promoted bortezomib-induced apoptosis in GIST-T1 cells.Our data suggest that combination therapy exerts better efficiency for eradicating GISTcells and may be apromising strategy for the future treatment of GISTs.

# Introduction

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors(GISTs) are the largest subset of mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract[1,2].GISTs,derived from interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC) or gastrointestinal mesenchymal stem cells,are distinguished from other mesenchymal tumors occurringin the digestive tract,such as leiomyoma,leiomyosarcoma,and schwannoma,by theiraberrant expression of c-KIT(CD117),a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) [3-5]. Over the past1O years,based on our understanding of the role of RTKs in the potential oncogenesis of GISTs,the implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the therapeutic strategy for GISTs [6,7]. Imatinib, the first-line TKI in treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),has been approved and widelyapplied for GIST therapy [8].

$c$ -KIT（mammalian cellular homolog of $\nu$ -KITin HardyZuckerman-feline sarcoma virus） proto-oncogene is a $1 4 5 \mathrm { - k D }$ transmembrane RTK,consisting of a extracellular ligand-binding domain,a single transmembrane domain,an intracellular juxtamembrane region,and a split intracellular kinase domain [9]. When the c-KIT ligand is bound, the stem cell factor(SCF) and two neighboring c-KIT proteins undergo dimerization followed by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane region and kinase domains,which formatted as the dock sits of Src homology 2(SH2) domains of a variety of signal molecules,including PI3K, AKT,ERK,and so on[9,1O].The activation of factors downstream of the c-KIT signaling cascade is extremely important for pro-oncogenic cellular progress,and specifically for anti-apoptosis [11-13].However, the precise underlying role of c-KIT involvement in the apoptosis cascade is rarely investigated.

Most cases of GISTs harbor a c-KIT mutation,most frequently in exon11,which encodes a juxtamembrane region normally functioning in inhibiting c-KITauto-phosphorylation[14,15].Although c-KIT is the marker and target of GIST therapy, the remarkable heterogeneity due to mutations in different sites inhibits the general application of TKIs [16,17].Among the different sites for c-KIT mutations,exon 11is the most commonly influenced region and is associated with the best response to imatinib,whereas other mutation types indicate pre-clinical resistance to imatinib therapy[16-18]. Inaddition, half of the patients enjoying the initial benefits of imatinib therapy will develop resistance to imatinib withinapproximately2 years,which is classified as delayed resistance [16].Hence,a novel therapeutic strategy for GISTs is still needed for clinical practice.

Dasatinib (BMS-354825),a dual SRC/ABL inhibitor,isa multikinase inhibitor targeting the SRC family (SRC,LCK,YES,FYN), c-KIT, and platelet-derived growth factorreceptor $\beta$ (PDGFRβ)[19-21].It has been approval for treating primary or secondary imatinibresistance GISTs and wild-type GISTs (no mutations in either $c$ -KIT or $P D G F R \beta ,$ . Inaddition,dasatinib shows promise as a TKI therapy for GISTs according to its higher binding capacity to c-KIT or PDGFRβ regardless of the conformation of the c-KIT activation loop[22,23]. However,like imatinib,the heterogeneity of c-KIT also imposes restrictions on the use of dasatinib as a GIST therapy [16,24].For instance,only GISTs harboring certain mutations in the activation loop of c-KIT may benefit from dasatinib treatment [25,26].Moreover,in CML and Philadelphia-positive $\left( \mathrm { P h } + \right)$ leukemia,resistance to dasatinib has been proven to be associated with aberrant BCR/ABL expression or certain mutation types [27].In this study,we found thatupregulation of $\mathsf { c }$ -KITinducedbydasatinib significantlyreduced the cytotoxicity of dasatinib in GIST-T1 cells.Therefore,preclinical research about how to overcome the obstacle of c-KIT heterogeneity for the clinical application of TKI is needed.

In order to prolong disease free survival in GIST patients,alternative TKIs or combined TKI therapeutic strategies with other chemotherapeutic agents targeting c-KIT or PDGFR or downstream factors of RTKs have shown potential for GIST treatment [28,29].Hence,induction of degradation of c-KIT by chemoagents may providea new insight for treatment of GISTs.The cellular protein degradation systems including ubiquitin-proteasome system and lysosome system are intimately related to the apoptosis pathway due to their destruction of endogenous or exogenous anti-apoptosis proteins [30,31]. Previous research showed membrane receptor proteinsare usually degraded trough ubiquitin and an E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase,Cbl-mediated lysosome pathway [32,33].However, the precise mechanism by which c-KIT is degraded and how it regulates apoptosis in GISTs is still unknown.Recently,our previous research revealed that bortezomib (BOR),a proteasome inhibitor, was reported to regulate the c-KIT-involved apoptosis cascade in leukemia cells through inducing c-KIT internalization and lysosomeinduced degradation [34]. Hence,in this study, based on evidence that upregulation of c-KIT induced by dasatinib influenced the therapeutic efficiency of dasatinib in GISTs,we aimed to investigate if the combination of dasatinib and BOR exerted a synergetic cytotoxicity on GIST cells.

# Materialsandmethods

# Cell culture

GIST-T1 cells were obtained from the Shanghai Institute for Biological Science (Shanghai, China) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco;Carlsbad,CA,USA) containing $1 0 \% \mathrm { ( v o l / v o l ) }$ fetal bovine serum (FBS;Gibco), $1 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ penicillin,and $1 0 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ streptomycin in a $5 \% \left( \mathrm { v o l / v o l } \right) \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ atmosphere at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C .$ Cells in the exponential growth phase were coincubated with dasatinib,BOR,and/or dynasore (DY) at indicated concentrations.

Drugs and antibodies

Dasatinib and BOR were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston,TX, USA) and DY was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,MO, USA). Total-c-KIT, phospho$c$ -KIT (p-c-KIT),total-PDGFRβ,phospho-PDGFRβ (p-PDGFRβ),Cbl, total-heat shock protein (Hsp) 9oβ,and apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) primary antibodies for western blot,immunoprecipitation,or immunofluorescence were obtained from Cell Signaling(Danvers,MA,USA).Phosphor-Hsp9Oβ(p-Hsp9Oβ;pTyr) antibody was purchased from Millipore (Billerica,MA,USA).Anti-His and anti-Flag primary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology(Dallas,TX, USA).The GAPDH primary antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Kangchen Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) and Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) secondary antibody were both purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

# Plasmids/siRNAtransfections

Before transfection, c-KIT and Hsp9Oβ were cloned into pcDNA3.1(-)-Flag vectors. Similarly,His-Apaf-1 was subcloned into a pcDNA3.1(-) vector from pFastBac-HisApaf-1. GIST-T1 cells were transfected with plasmids or small interfering(si) RNAs using Lipofectamine-2ooo (Invitrogen) for 6 hours and all experiments were performed in 72 hours after transfection according to manufacturer's instructions.

# Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis

GIST-T1 cell lysates were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling). The protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,Rockford, IL, USA).Prepared protein lysates were mixed with loading buffer,denatured by boiling,separated using $1 0 \%$ SDS-PAGE gels,and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore).After blocking with Tris-buffered saline(TBS)and $0 . 1 \%$ Tween 20(TBS/T) containing $5 \%$ bovine serum albumin for2 hours,membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ overnight. The membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature.Protein bands were developed by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare;Piscataway, NJ, USA) and visualized using an autoradiography kit (Kodak;Rochester, NY,USA).For immunoprecipitation analysis,cell lysates pre-incubated with conditional antibodies were precipitated for 2 hours by pre-washed Protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precipitated complex was washed, separated using $10 \%$ SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF membranes,and then incubated with anti-Cbl,anti-His,anti-Flag, anti-Hsp9oβ,anti-p-Hsp9Oβ,anti-c-KIT,or anti-Apaf-1 primary antibodies and a HRPconjugated secondaryantibody.

# Assessment ofcell viability,proliferation and apoptosis

Cells were plated into 96-well plates cultured in media containing different drugs for indicated times.The cell viabilities were tested using the cell count kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo;Kumamoto, Japan) following the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation with CKK-8 solutions for 3 hours,the absorbance of each wells was then measured at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ using a MRX II microplate reader (Dynex,Chantilly,VA,USA).Relative cell viability was determined as a percentage of untreated control cells.Calculation of the half maximal inhibitory concentration $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } )$ of different drugs were performed using Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla,CA,USA) and the combination index (CI) value of the combination of the two drugs was calculated using formula $\mathrm { ^ { \circ } C I } = ( \mathrm { I C _ { 5 0 } } ) _ { \mathrm { C - D } } / ( \mathrm { I C _ { 5 0 } } ) _ { \mathrm { D } } + \left( \mathrm { I C _ { 5 0 } } \right) _ { \mathrm { C - B } } / ( \mathrm { I C _ { 5 0 } } ) _ { \mathrm { B } } \mathrm { ^ { \circ } }$ ,where $\mathsf { C I } \leq 0 . 9 , > 0 . 9$ and $< 1 . 1 , \geq 1 . 1$ indicate synergism,additive effect,and antagonism,respectively [35].In the denominator, $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } ) _ { \mathrm { D } }$ or $( \Gamma C _ { 5 0 } ) _ { \mathrm { B } }$ is for the concentration of "dasatinib or BOR alone" that inhibits the cell viability by $50 \%$ In the numerators, $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } ) _ { \mathrm { C - D } }$ or $( \mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } ) _ { \mathrm { C } - \mathrm { B } }$ means the respective $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of dasatinib or BOR“in combination"treatment.The proliferation of treated GIST-T1 cells was detected using Click-iT 5-ethynyl-2O-deoxyuridine (EdU) Imaging Kit (Invitrogen) as described previously [36].In brief, treated GIST-T1 cellswere incubated with EdU for2 hours followed by fixed with $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and permeabilized with $0 . 5 \%$ Triton X-100 for 20 minutes. Then cells were incubated with 1X Click-iT reaction cocktails for 30 minutes in dark. After stained by Hoechst 33342,cells were visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus,Tokyo,Japan).For quantification of treated GIST-T1 cell proliferation,five randomly selected views from each treatment were used to calculate the relative EdU-positive cell ratio. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using an Annexin V-FITC/PI kit (Invitrogen) for flow cytometry according to manufacturer's instruction.

# Cell cycle analysis

Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry by staining GIST-T1 cell DNA with propidium iodide (PI; Dawen; Shanghai, China).Distribution of cell cycle was analyzed using the ModFit software (Verity software house;Topsham,ME,USA).In brief,treated cells were fixed by pre-chilled ethanol overnight and centrifuged before being incubation with PI.

In brief,cells planted on slides were fixed with $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes before being permeabilized in $0 . 5 \%$ Triton X-1o0 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).Subsequently,cells were incubated in c-KIT primary antibody overnight and AF-488-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hours followed by incubation with DAPI for2 minutes.Immunofluorescence images were taken and captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope.

# Statistical analyses

All experimental data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) values. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism5 (GraphPad).Student's t-test and the two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test were used to assess the significance of different treatments;statistical significance was defined as a $P$ -value $< 0 . 0 5$ .Each treatment was assayed in triplicate.

# Results

Upregulationofc-KITinducedbydasatinibtreatmentwas responsible fordasatinibchemoresistancein GiST-T1cells

We first assessed the response of GIST-T1 to dasatinib and phosphorylation patterns of c-KITand PDGFRβ,the two main target TRKs of dasatinib,in the presence or absence of dasatinib in GIST-T1 cells. We found that p-c-KIT and p-PDGFRβ were highly expressed,which means that c-KIT and $\mathsf { P D G F R } \boldsymbol { \beta }$ were activated in GIST-T1 cells (Fig.1A);however,as a multi-kinase inhibitor,dasatinib did not reduce the phosphorylation of $\mathsf { c }$ -KITorPDGFR $\mathfrak { B }$ in GIST-T1 cells (Fig.1A),and thus dasatinib did not significantly inhibit the cell viability of GIST-T1 cells(Fig.1B). Interestingly,after 24 hoursof treatment with dasatinib,the expression of c-KIT,but not PDGFRβ, was significantlyup-regulated,which indicates that upregulation of c-KIT might result in chemoresistance to dasatinib in GIST-T1 cells. To confirm this,we artificially down-regulated the expression of c-KIT using $c$ -KITsiRNAand foundthatdasatinibdramaticallyinhibited cell growth in $c$ -KIT siRNA-treated GIST-T1 cells,the $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of dasatinib significantly downregulated in $c$ -KIT siRNA-treated GIST-T1 cells (Fig. 1B;WT vs. $c$ -KITsiRNA, $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ,two-way ANOVA). Moreover,dasatinib also reduced the phosphorylationofPDGFR $\beta$ in $c$ -KIT siRNA-treated GIST-T1 cells(Fig.1A).This evidence indicates that upregulation of c-KIT induced by dasatinib might be responsible for chemo-resistance to dasatinib in GIST-T1 cells.

In addition,we found that the percentage of apoptotic ratio significantly increased in $c$ -KIT siRNA GIST-T1 cells(Fig. S1A). And dasatinib significantly promoted the apoptosis induced by c-KIT siRNA; however dasatinib did not induce apoptosis in WT GIST-T1 (Fig.1C;Fig.S1A). Cell cycle analysis showed that compared to wild type(WT) GIST-T1 cells, $c$ -KIT siRNA GIST-T1 cells were arrested in G1 phase after treatment with dasatinib(Fig.1C;Fig. S1B).

Combinationtreatmentwith bortezomib reversed dasatinib-induced upregulationof $c$ -KIT and exerted synergetic cytotoxicity in GIST-T1 cells

To investigate if combination treatment could increase the sensitivity of GIST-T1 to dasatinib,we tested theviabilityof GIST-T1 cells treated with dasatinib alone,BORaloneand dasatinib plus BOR and then calculated the $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ of dasatinib and BOR and the CI value of the combination of the two drugs (Table1;Fig.2A). Compared to dasatinib alone,combination treatment significantly inhibited cell viability(Fig.2A). Inaddition,BOR reduced c-KIT and p-c-KIT eXpression,and the expression of c-KIT,p-c-KIT,and p-PDGFRβ were also significantly reduced after treatmentwith dasatinib plus BOR; however,BOR alone had little effect on the expression of p-PDGFRβ (Fig.2B).The total expression of PDGFRβ did not significantly change following these treatments (Fig.2B).

Furthermore,combined treatment did not exert a synergetic effect in $c$ -KIT siRNA-treated GIST-T1 cells compared to dasatinib treatment alone (Fig.2C;Table 1). In addition,when the expression of $\mathsf { P D G F R } \boldsymbol { \beta }$ was inhibited by $P D G F R \beta$ siRNA in GIST-T1 cells,combined treatment did not exert a synergetic effect compared to BOR alone (Fig.2D;Table1).An Edu incorporation assay was used to assess proliferation inhibition of GIST-T1 or $c$ -KIT/PDGFRβ siRNA GISTT1 cells treated with dasatinib,BOR,or dasatinib plus BOR.In agreement with CCK8 results,combination treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation of GIST-T1 cells compared to dasatinib alone (Fig.2E;Fig. S2A); however, $c$ -KITsiRNA or $P D G F R \beta$ siRNA significantlyattenuated the synergetic effectof dasatinib plus BOR compared to dasatinib or BOR treatment, respectively(Fig.2F; Fig. S2B).

# $c$ -KITwas endocytosed in a clathrin-mediated way and degraded by binding to Cbl afterbortezomib treatment

To investigate how BOR resulted in down-regulation of c-KIT in GIST-T1 cells,we measured the expression of c-KIT after BOR treatment alone by western blot and immunofluorescence assay.We found that after BOR treatment for 24 hours,c-KIT and p-c-KIT expression were dramatically down-regulated (Fig.3A) and the immunofluorescenceanalyses of c-KIT revealed that it was endocytosed and degraded at the late stage (24 hours) in GIST-T1 cells (Fig.3B). Previous studies showed that internalization of c-KIT was mediated by clathrin;hence,we evaluated the role of clathrin in BOR-caused internalization of c-KIT using DY,an inhibitor of dynamin,which is essential for the formation of coated vesicles of clathrin-mediated internalization [37].We found that incubation with DY inhibited the internalization and degradation of c-KIT induced by BOR(Fig.3C) and retained c-KIT on the cell membrane in the presence of BOR in GISTT1 cells (Fig.3D).Moreover,DY reversed bortezomib-induced inhibition of cell viability and apoptosis (Fig. S3).

When c-KIT is endocytosed by BOR,it might undergo ubiquitination and degradation by binding to the ubiquitin ligase E3,amongwhich the Cbl familyis the most important.To verify the hypothesis that c-KIT was degraded by binding to Cbl,we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to test the interaction of Cbl and c-KIT in GIST-T1 cells.We found that without BOR treatment,c-KIT did not bind to Cbl;after 12 hours of BOR treatment, the expression of Cbl and the binding of c-KIT and Cbl was drasticallyup-regulated,which indicates that c-KIT had been modified byubiquitin molecules and as a target protein followed by degradation (Fig.3E).To confirm the role of Cbl in the degradation of c-KIT,Cbl siRNA was exerted and we found that BOR-induced downregulation of c-KIT was reversed by knockout of the Cbl gene in GIST-T1 cells (Fig.3F;Fig. S4). This evidence shows that BOR down-regulates the expression of c-KIT through rendering the internalization of c-KIT,which was subsequently degraded by binding to Cbl in GIST-T1 cells.

With respect to how c-KIT degradation contributes to the inhibition of proliferation of GIST-T1 cells,we speculated that c-KIT might interplay with pro-apoptotic factors and once c-KIT was internalized and degraded,these factors were released from the complex and propagated their downstream pathway. On the basis ofour hypothesis and previous research [34],we tested the interaction of c-KIT and $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ by co-immunoprecipitation assay in GIST-T1 cells.We transfected Flag-Hsp9Oβ and/or Flag-c-KIT plasmids into 293T cells and found that c-KIT not only bound to $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ but also induced phosphorylation of $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ ,which represents its activated status (Fig.4A). In GIST-T1 cells,BOR induced downregulation of c-KIT and resulted in down-regulation of $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ phosphorylation (Fig. 4B).

It has been reported that Apaf-1 has a high bindingaffnity for $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ [38].To confirm if Apaf-1 was the main factor in mediating BOR-induced inhibition of cell growth,the purified protein of293T cells transfected with Flag-Hsp9Oβ and His- Apaf-1 was incubated with c-KIT protein isolated from GIST-T1 cells and we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and western blot assays to investigate the relationship between c-KIT, $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ and Apaf-1.We found thatc-KIT significantly enhanced the bindingaffinity of $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ and Apaf-1 through inducing phosphorylation of $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ (Fig.4C). In GIST-T1 cells,BOR decreased phosphorylation of $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ andreleased Apaf-1 from the complex (Fig.4B).This evidence indicates that phosphorylation of $\mathsf { H s p 9 0 } \beta$ induced by c-KIT is essential for Apaf-1 sequestration.

Dasatinib enhanced the apoptosis induced by bortezomib by cell cycle arrest in G1in GIST-T1 cells

As Apaf-1 plays a role in promoting apoptosis [39],we determined GIST-T1 apoptosis status after treatment with dasatinib, BOR,and dasatinib plus BOR.We found that dasatinib alone could not trigger obvious apoptosis,and BOR only induced an approximately $10 \%$ apoptotic cell ratio in treated cells；however,the combination of dasatinib and BOR resulted in significant increase of percentage of apoptotic cell ratio (Fig.5A;Fig. S1C).We also found that $P D G F R \beta$ siRNA relieved cell cycle arrest induced by dasatinib and attenuated dasatinib-induced promotion of apoptosis triggered by BOR in combination treatment(Fig.5B;Fig.S1D and E).

# Discussion

Under physiological conditions,the activation of RTKs is triggered by binding to its ligand SCF,which is necessary to maintain the normal proliferation of cells[4O]. Over the past decade,scientists have delineated the central role of RTKs in the pathophysiology of GISTs and that aberrant expression of constitutively activated c-KIT or PDGFR is the main characteristic of GISTs and also the target of TKIs[15].The implementation of TKIs,including imatinib,sunitinib, and dasatinib,has revolutionized the therapeutic strategy for GISTs. Unfortunately,like theapplication of TKIs in CML,resistance to TKIs in GISTs occurs quickly [41].The sensitivity of GISTs to different TKIs is dependent on the specific mutation site on c-KIT or PDGFR[17]. The mutation on c-KIT exon 11 is the most frequent mutation in GISTs and these tumors experience the best response to imatinib therapy;however,the other types of c-KIT mutations oftenreflect primary resistance to imatinib[16].Due to acquired secondary mutations that may interfere with drugactivity on c-KIT,GISTs eventually become resistant to imatinib.Nevertheless,these observations indicate that secondary resistance of GISTs to RTKs is still dependent on c-KIT-driven and downstream activation.Hence,an alternative strategy to inhibit the c-KIT pathway is still needed.This is inagreement with other potential approaches,including inhibition of c-KIT transcription, genetic alteration of c-KIT,application of monoclonalantibodies,and/or the combination ofTKIs and inhibitors of PI3K [28,42,43].In this study,we showed that BOR,a proteasome inhibitor,significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of dasatinib in GIST-T1 cells through internalization and subsequent degradation of c-KIT by binding to Cbl. Dasatinib did not induce obvious apoptosis in GIST-T1,but it significantly enhanced the apoptosis induced by BOR.

While binding to SCF,c-KIT will immediately dimerize and internalize ina clathrin-dependent manner [44].In GIST-T1 cells,we found that BOR-induced internalization of c-KIT was also clathrindependent by pretreating cells with DY,which inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin that disturbs the formation of clathrin-coated transmembrane vesicles.Inaddition, the retention of c-KIT on cell membranes by DY inhibited BOR-induced apoptosis in GIST-T1 cells, which indicates that internalization of c-KIT is essential for BORinduced apoptosis.We also found after c-KIT internalization,c-KIT degradation was the downstream gatekeeper for BOR-induced apoptosis based on the observation that BOR did not induce apoptosis in Cbl siRNA GIST-T1 cells.These data suggest that c-KIT might bind to an apoptosis initiator,which can be released when c-KIT isdegraded.

Other studies on GIST therapy have shown that an Hsp9O inhibitor decreased the expression ofc-KITand significantly inhibited the growth of GIST cells even harboring the secondary c-KIT mutation [45].c-KIT might be the substrate client proteinas Hsp9o functionsasa cellular molecular chaperone.Indeed,in this study,we found that c-KIT could bindand phosphorylate ${ \mathrm { H s p 9 0 } } { \mathrm { ‰} }$ ,through which c-KIT indirectly sequestrated Apaf-1.When Apaf-1 was released by BOR treatment,it might initiate the apoptosis cascade by recruiting cytochrome cand dATP [39].

A troublesome question related to the clinical treatment of GISTs is that most individuals undergo a quiescent response to TKIs after initial sensitivity [46]. Therefore,it is important to identify the best approach to kill quiescent cells.In this study,we also found that dasatinib treatment did not induce obvious apoptosis in GIST-T1 cells.However, when treating cells with dasatinib plus BOR,cells underwent dramatic apoptosis,whereas BOR treatment alone only triggered apoptosis in the minority of GIST-T1 cells.Hence,we hypothesize that although dasatinib could not induce apoptosis,dasatinib-induced cell cycle arrest facilitated BOR-induced apoptosis in GIST-T1 cells and the synergetic pro-apoptosis effect was PDGFRβ dependent because dasatinibinduced upregulation of c-KIT was reversed by BOR(Fig.S5),which was further confirmed by PDGFRβ knockdown in GIST-T1 cells.In agreement with other research[47],our data also demonstrated that PDGFRβ functioned asa regulator of cell cycle.In this study,we presenta novel therapeutic method to eradicate GIST cells by treating themwith a combination of dasatinib and BOR regardless of c-KIT mutation status,which may benefit TKl-resistant GIST patients.
