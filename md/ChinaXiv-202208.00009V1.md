AbstractThe Lijiang Fauna from the Lijiang Formation of Lijiang,western Yunnan,was dominated by 13 species of perissodactyl fossils,and its age ranged from Irdinmanhan to Sharamurunian Asian Land Mammal Ages (ALMA) according to previous research.Based on reanalysis of some perissodactyls from the Lijiang Fauna,it is suggested here that Rhodopagus yunnanensis is a junior synonym of Lijiangia zhangi,which is similar to Lophiohippus and placed in Anchilophini within the Palaeotheriidae.The enigmatic and scarce Lunania is here regarded as a palaeothere rather than a chalicothere based on its morphological similarities with Paranchilophus,and Lophiohippus probably represents the upper dentitions of Lunania. Furthermore,deperetellid Diplolophodon is revised and comprised of three species:D.similis, D. lunanensis,and $D$ .xiangshanensis (comb. nov.). Teleolophus xiangshanensis from the Lijiang Formation is reassigned to Diplolophodon xiangshanensis.The revised perissodactyls from the Lijiang Fauna are comparable to those from the Rencun Member of the Hedi Formation of the Yuanqu Basin,and its age is confined to Sharamurunian ALMA.

# 1 Introduction

The deposits in the Lijiang Basin of western Yunnan were first referred to the Tertiary "limestone breccia formation”by Misch (1945). Zhao (1965) named the Lijiang Formation for these deposits and suggested its age as the Late Eocene based on the mammal fossils discovered from the top of the Lijiang Formation. Zhao (1965) speculated the lower part of the Lijiang Formation,which is more than a thousand meters in thickness,likely extends to the Early Eocene-Paleocene or even the Cretaceous. Zhang et al. (1978) separated the upper part of the Lijiang Formation as the Xiangshan Formation,which varies from 150 to $2 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ thick and bears plenty of fossil mammals.However, whether or not the Xiangshan Formation needs to be separated from the Lijiang Formation is still controversial (Zheng et al., 1999; Wang et al.,2021).Furthermore,the Xiangshan Group has been named by Lee et al. (1935) for the Early and Middle Jurassic deposits in Jiangsu and Anhui.

Zong et al. (1996) described the mammal fossils from the Xiangshan Formation in the Lijiang Basin (Fig.1) and suggested that the age of the Lijiang Fauna is mainly Sharamurunian with some Irdinmanhan taxa.The Lijiang Fauna is composed of 19 species,which are dominated by 13 perissodactyl species including brontothere Metatelmatheriinae gen. et sp. indet., tapiroid Lophialetes? sp., Breviodon lumeiyiensis, Teleolophus xiangshanensis, Diplolophodon similis, rhinocerotoid Amynodontidae gen. et sp. indet.， Prohyracodon major, P. meridionale, Lijiangia zhangi, Rhodopagus yunanensis, chalicothere Lunania youngi, Eomoropus minimus, and ?Grangeria cania (Zong et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2013). These materials are more or less fragmentary and preserved under poor conditions,which can be attributed to the active tectonic movement in the region (Zong et al., 1996). In preparation of the Perissodactyla volume of “Palaeovertebrata Sinica”,I noticed some debatable identifications of specimens from the Lijiang Fauna. Here new interpretations of these controversial species are proposed along with a brief discussion of their affnities. Due to the fact that the species reanalyzed in the present paper have already been described in detail by Zong et al. (1996) and Huang (1999), this paper focuses on their validities and affinities.

# 2 Methods

The specimen IVPP V 9901,V 12471,and $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 9 9 0 3$ were scanned using a GE vltome|x $\mathrm { m } 3 0 0$ &180 micro-computed-tomography scanner (GE Measurement & Control, Wuntsdorf, Germany) that is housed at the Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origin of Chinese Academy of Sciences.The data sets have resolutions of $2 4 . 5 3 8 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ (for V 9901) and $2 8 . 9 3 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ (forV12471,V 9903),and the scans were carried out at $1 4 0 ~ \mathrm { k V }$ and 140 or $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { \textmu A }$ .Two frames per projection were acquired by a timing of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ for a total of 1800 projections. The 3D virtual models were reconstructed by VGStudio Max (version 3.2).

The dental terminology follows Dashzeveg and Hooker (1997), which essentially follows Hooker (1989,1994). It is necessary to mention that the protostylid, as used by Dashzeveg and Hooker (1997), is a crest labial to the protoconid and raising from the cingulid at the ectoflexid, and the posthypocristid is a short crest extending posteriorly from the hypoconid.

DiscussionThe holotype of Lijiangia zhangi (IVPP V 99o8) is a fragmentary maxilla with P4-M3 (Fig.2A). The M1 is heavily worn and the crown has many small cracks, which contributes to its relatively larger size. The M2 is moderately worn and nearly undeformed, but both the paracone and parastyle are broken. Therefore,it is uncertain whether or not the M2 parastyle is overlapped by the Ml metastyle,which is not the case in other tapiromorphs. Although the metastyle of the P4 partially overlaps the parastyle of the M1, the P4 is not completely erupted.It is doubtful that the condition would remain same after the P4 is completely erupted, because a small metastyle of the P4 unlikely overlaps a relatively larger M1 parastyle. As a result, two main diagnosis characters of Lijiangia as proposed by Zong et al. (1996), the M1 considerably larger than the M2 and the parastyle overlapped by metastyle of the preceding tooth, cannot be confirmed based on the preserved condition of the specimen. On the other hand,the specimen is characterized by a rib-shaped parastyle,a strongly oblique metaloph joining the midpoint between the paracone and metacone,and a long postmetacrista on M1-2.

Zong et al. (1996) also reported a new species Rhodopagus yunnanensis from the Lijiang Formation at locality 83oo9 where Lijiangia was discovered. The material of $R$ yunnanensis comprises a left maxilla with DP2-4 and the M1 (IVPP V 9909, holotype) (Fig. 2B),a left maxilla with the M2 and broken M1 (V 9909.1) (Fig.2C),a left M1/2 (V 9909.3) (Fig.2D),and a right M3 (V 9909.2) rather than the M2 (Fig. 2E) as originally assigned. The V 9909.2 has a relatively more lingually depressed metacone and a probable more distinct, labially deflected metastyle with a convex basal posterior border than on the M1 and M2, so it is more likely to be the M3 than the M1 or M2. Zong et al.(1996) considered that $R$ yunnanensis is similar to $R$ minimus $\scriptstyle ( = R$ pygmaeus) in morphology, but is relatively larger, has a parastyle rib that is more labially protruded, the paracone and parastyle are more convex, and the metacone and metastyle (i.e. longer postmetacrista) are longer on the upper molars. In addition, $R .$ yunnanensis differs further from $R$ 、minimus in having more oblique metalophs on M1-3 and probably a labially deflected metastyle on the M3.The long postmetacrista on M1-2 of $R .$ yunnanensis is also characterized by those of Lijiangia.Furthermore, the metaloph is strongly oblique and joins the ectoloph between the paracone and metacone on M1-2 in both species.The slightly worn M1/2(V 9909.3) and M3(V 9909.2) of $R$ yunnanensis show that the metaloph oriented towards the parastyle and then curves to the midpoint between the paracone and metacone.The two species are also very similar in size and from the same locality. The M1 of $R .$ yunnanensis has a more prominent paracone rib and parastyle rib than that of Lijiangia,but the difference can be attributed to a lesser degree of wear in the former. As a result, Rhodopagus yunnanensis is regarded as a junior synonym of Lijiangia zhangi.The M3 of‘Rhodopagus' yunnanensis indicates the probable presence of a well-developed,labially deflected metastyle in Lijiangia.

Huang and Wang (2Oo1) uncertainly assigned two isolated upper and lower molars (IVPP V 12468,12469) to ?Rhodopagus yunnanensis from the Hedi Formation of the Yuanqu Basin, Shanxi. However, they are closer to Yimengia than to Rhodopagus or Lijiangia in having a moderately long postmetacristia and less oblique metaloph on the upper molar, as well as a transversely extended protolophid and distinct cristid obliqua on the lower molar (Bai et al., 2020).

Huang and Qi (1982) reported a new species Lophialetes yunnanensis from the Lunan Basin in Yunnan Province.Bai (2Ol7) pointed out its affnity with European anchilophins and erected a new genus Lophiohippus for the species.Although Lophiohippus is only known by a maxilla with three molars,it is similar to Lijiangia in having a rib-like paracone and parastyle, long postmetacrista, strongly oblique metaloph,and in that the M3 metastyle was probably labially deflected.Lophiohippus differs from Lijiangia in its larger size,by having a more compressed parastyle which seems more separated from the paracone,and in having a slightly convex labial surface of the ectoloph on M1-2.Whether or not the parastyle overlaps the metastyle of the preceding teeth, which is a diagnostic character in Lophiohippus, is uncertain in Lijiangia. However,determining whether or not the differences between Lophiohippus and Lijiangia are at the generic level depends on the discoveries of more complete specimens. Bai (2017)assigned Lophiohippus to Anchilophini and suggested that it is closer to Paranchilophus than to Anchilophus.Because M1-3 of Lijiangia is similar to that of Lophiohippus, it is more logical to assign Lijiangia in Anchilophini rather than the ?Hyracodontidae as initially placed.Thus,both Lophiohippus and Lijiangia represent palaeothere anchilophins in the Middle Eocene of Asia, indicating sporadic communications between Asia and Europe during the Middle Eocene (Bai, 2017).

The recognition of Lijiangia and Lophiohippus as palaeotheres also illuminate theaffinityofLunania.The enigmaticLunania comprises two species: L. youngi from the Lunan and Lijiang Basin of Yunnan (Chow, 1957; Zong et al., 1996) (Fig. 3) and L. zhoui from Yuanqu Basin of Shanxi (Huang,2002). Chow(1957) initially assigned Lunania to the Lophiodontidae based on its general lophiodont teeth and a looped hypoconulid on the m3.Chow（1962） suggested a relationship of Lunania with chalicotheres and noticed its similarities with chalicothere Eomoropus ulterior from the Lunan Basin in having a transversely extended protolophid and hypolophid,anterolingually directed paralophid and cristid obliqua,and a cleft-like depression on the lingual side of the hypoconulid. However, Lunania differs from Eomoropus and other chalicotheres in lacking the twinned metaconids on the lower molars as pointed out by Chow (1962). On the other hand,Lunania shows some similarities with palaeothere Paranchilophus in lacking twinned metaconids on the lower molars, in having small hypoconulid on $\mathrm { m } 1 { - } 2$ ,and a relatively small size and high hyposodont (Remy,2O12). The lower molars of Paranchilophus differ from those of Lunania by having a higher paralophid and cristid obliqua, a rounded crescent of trigonid and/or talonid, and a much more oblique protolophid and hypolophid (Remy, 2012). It is likely that the holotype of Lophiohippus represents the upper molars of Lunania,which is known only from the lower molars.Both Lophiohippus and Lunania are certainly from the Lumeiyi Formation (Russell and Zhai, 1987),nearly the same in size (ml-3 length of Lunania $3 1 . 6 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ; M1-3 length of Lophiohippus $3 3 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ),and show similarities in morphologies with Paranchilophus.Thus, Lophiohippus has to be regarded as a junior synonym of Lunania if their association is proved by more complete specimens in the future.

Discussion The holotype of Diplolophodon similis is only known by a maxilla with $\mathrm { P } 3 -$ M3 from the Lok.7 of Mianchi in Henan (Zdansky,1930). Young (1937) assgned a maxilla with P2-4 to the species and erected a new species $D$ .major from Yuanqu of Shanxi, which is located on the opposite bank of the Lok. 7. Radinsky (1965) suggested that $D$ .major is a junior synonym of $D$ ，similis,and Diplolophodon is synonymous of Deperetella. Chow et al. (1974), in agreement with Radinsky (1965), placed two maxillae with P3-4 and three mandibles with lower cheek teeth to Deperetella similis discovered from the Shilin (Lunan) of Yunnan. However, Ding et al. (1977) still considered Diplolophodon as a valid genus and assigned a lower jaw with p3-4 and the m3 to Diplolophodon cf.D.similis from the Dongjun Formation of the Bose Basin, Guangxi. Zong et al. (1996) assigned isolated cheek teeth and a mandible with $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { m } } 2 - 3$ (IVPP V 9904, 9904.1-7) to Diplolophodon similis from the Lijiang Formation of Yunnan. Jin and Seo (2Oo1) erected a new species Diplolophodon lunanensis based on the Shilin specimens described by Chow et al. (1974); they also assigned $D$ ，similis from Lijiang and Diplolophodon cf. $D$ ，similis from Bose to Diplolophodon cf. $D$ lunanensis. In contrast, Dashzeveg and Hooker(1997) and Tsubamoto et al. (2005） still considered Diplolophodon to be a junior synonym of Deperetella. Tsubamoto et al. (20o0) even synonymized all species of Diplolophodon from China with Deperetella birmanica,however, Tsubamoto et al. (2005) erected a new genus Bahinolophus for the species B. birmanicus from Myanmar. As pointed out by Ding et al. (1977), the ratio of the lower premolar length to molar lengths in Diplolophodon similis is 0.9,while that of Deperetella cristata is 1.13;Diplolophodon further differs from Deperetella by a relatively smaller canine,the single root of the pl, p1-2 not being elongated, the P2 being shorter and wider with the protoloph more parallel to the metaloph,and that the M1-3 posterolabial cingula are more prominent and lack of lingual cingula (Radinsky,1965;Ding et al.,1977). Thus,Diplolophodon is a valid genus,and the species D. similis is different from Deperetella cristata at the generic level.

Here,it is agreed that Shilin specimens represent a new species Diplolophodon lunanensis,which is mainly characterized by a flat and straight ectoloph on P3-4,a prominent paraconule on the P3,a cristid obliqua developed and distinct cristid posterior to the hypoconid on the p3,and a p4 that is relatively short and wide as pointed out by Jin and Seo (2O01). The P4 of Shilin material further differs from that of $D$ ，similis by the protoloph dying out before reaching the ectoloph.

Zong et al.(1996) assinged isolated cheek teeth and a mandible with $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { m } } 2 - 3$ (V 9904, 9904.1-7) to $D$ 、similis from the Lijiang Formation of Yunnan. The P3(V 9904.3) and M2-3 ofLijiang material are generally similar to those of holotype of $D$ ，similis,but the former lacks the lingual cingulum on the P3 and a postmetacrista on the M3,as well as has a less distinct posterolabial cingula (metastyle) on M2-3.However, these differences could be attributed to intraspecific variation. The Lijiang material are narrower (m2 length-width ratio 1.22） than those of $D$ .lunanensis (m2 length-width ratio 1.01),and the P3 of former lacks a distinct paraconule.The material from Lijiang is therefore more reasonably assigned to $D$ similis than to Diplolophodon cf. $D$ 、lunanensis. Unfortunately, the lower premolars were not preserved in any reported $D$ ，similis from Lijiang.

Zong et al. (1996) reported a mandible with dp3-m1 (V 9901) to Lophialetes? sp. (Fig. 4A) from the Loc. 83009 where the Lijiang specimens of $D$ ，similis were found. However, the preserved three teeth are indeed p2-4 as clearly shown by CT image (Fig. 4A4),and their high degrees of molariform along with their small sizes indicate that the mandible is different from Lophialetes and more likely represents Diplolophodon. Considering $D$ ，similis has been also reported from the same locality, I tentatively assign the mandible with p2-4 to $D$ similis. The p3 of $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 9 9 0 1$ is similar to that of $D$ .lunanensis in having a high cristid obliqua joining the protoconid in a high position, and the former has a short crest (posthypocristid) descending posteriorly from the hypoconid,which is also discernable in $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 3 1$ of $D$ 、lunanensis. The p4 of $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 9 9 0 1$ differs from that of $D$ . lunanensis by a more lingually directed cristid obliqua. Whether or not the posthypocristid is also present on the p4 as in the p3 is uncertain in $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 9 9 0 1$ due to the breakage,but the posthypocristid of the p4 varies from discernable to absent in $D$ lunanensis. In addition, p2-4 of V 9901 have a well-developed,raising crestiform cingulid at the base of the ectoflexid, forming the protostylid as named by Dashzeveg and Hooker (1997), while the labial cingulids vary from absent to weak on p3-4 in the specimens of $D$ lunanensis. The $\mathsf { p 4 }$ of $D$ .lunanensis shows some other variations:one mandible of $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 3 1$ has a much weaker cristid obliqua and relatively wider talonid than in the other two specimens.

Huang and Wang (2oo1） reported a mandible with $\mathrm { m } 1 { - } 2$ (IVPPV 12471) from the Yuanqu Basin (Fig. 4B) and tentatively assigned it to Teleolophus cf. T. xiangshanensis based mainly on the small size and bilophodonty. However, CT images show that tooth germs are present beneath the teeth,indicating a mandible with dp3-dp4 rather than m1-2.The p3-4 are not complete,and the p4 is deformed with the occlusal surface somewhat towards the lingual side (Fig. 4B3). The preserved part of the p3 (Fig. 4C-D) has a well-developed protolophid and hypolophid,a high cristid obliqua joining the protoconid,a distinct paralophid, and a short posthypocristid. The preserved p4 (Fig.4D-E) also has a well-developed protolophid and hypolophid, but differs from the p3 in having more rounded angles at the protoconid,a lower cristid obliqua descending towards the protolophid,and a longer, more distinct posthypocristid. The p3-4 of V 12471 shows some similarities with that of V 9901,but differs from that of $D$

Note:Measurements of lower teeth are indicated by the asterisks after specimen numbers.The measurements of D.xiangshanensis are from dp3-dp4 and $\mathrm { m } 1 { - } 2$ ；numbers with superscript“#"mean approximate values.GMCV31 and V713 were remeasured,whileother measurementsofspecimensare from Zdansky(193o),Young(1937),Dingetal.(1977), Shi (1989) and Zong et al. (1996).

Ding et al. (1977) reported a fragmentary lower jaw with left p3-4 and m3 (IVPP V 5103) of Diplolophodon cf.D. similis from the Dongjun Formation of the Bose Basin, Guangxi. Ding et al. (1977) pointed out that the size and morphology of V 5103 are similar to those of $D$ 、similis from Shilin, but the former has relatively narrower teeth and slightly more distinct posterior cingulids on p3-4. The posterior cingulid on p3-4 is too damaged to confirm its condition.In addition, p3-4 of $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 5 1 0 3$ is similar to that of $D$ ，similis in having a relatively distinct paralophid and cristid obliqua,a high cristid obliqua on the p3,and a more lingually extended cristid obliqua on the p4. Thus, I suggest assigning $\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 5 1 0 3$ to $D$ similis.

Shi (1989) reported a new species Diplolophodon qufuensis based on a mandible with $\mathsf { p 4 - m 3 }$ (Fig. 5) from the Huangzhuang Formation in Qufu of Shandong. According to Shi (1989), $D$ qufuensis was diagnosed by its large size, the straight lower border of the horizontal ramus,a parallel protolophid and hypolophid, relatively narrow check teeth,a complete hypolophid on the $\mathfrak { p } 4$ ，and the absence of labial and lingual cingulids on the lower molars. However,many of these characters are common in Diplolophodon,and only two characters seem valid: a large size and relatively narrow check teeth. The size of $D$ qufuensis is close to that of $D$ 、similis (V 9904 and V 5103),and its $\mathrm { m } 2$ length-width ratio is 1.38,which is slightly greater than that of $D$ .similis.In addition, the p4 has an anterolingually directed cristid obliqua and a crestiform protostylid as in $D$ ，similis.Diplolophodon qufuensis is therefore considered to be a junior synonym of $D$ ，similis as proposed by Zong et al. (1996).

DiagnosisSmall Diplolophodon (ml length $1 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ); weak labial cingulids on lower molars; lower molar relatively narrower than in $D$ lunanensis.

Discussion Zong et al. (1996) erected a new species Teleolophus xiangshanensis based on a mandible (IVPP V 9903) that preserves three lower teeth interpreted as $\mathrm { d } { \mathsf { p } } 4 { \mathsf { - m } } 2$ (Fig. 6AD),although Zong et al. (1996) mentioned that no teeth are discernable in the socket. Zong et al.(1996) assigned the species to Teleolophus based on its small size, a weak labial cingulid on the lower molars,and the presence of cement. The CT image shows that beneath the teeth there are no tooth germs (Fig. 6E). However, the roots are relatively open between the tips (beyond the anterior and posterior borders of crown) in the anterior two teeth indicating that these teeth are deciduous. Furthermore, the preserved ultimate tooth is nearly unworn, whereas the anterior two teeth are moderately worn to a similar degree. Thus,the preserved ultimate tooth erupted later than the anterior two teeth, which suggests that the three preserved teeth are more reasonably interpreted as dp3-dp4 and the m1. In addition, the preserved anterior most tooth is rather elongated with three transverse lophids,which is a feature of the dp3 in some tapiroids (Radinsky, 1965).Thus,the teeth of this mandible are actually $\mathrm { d } \mathsf { p } 3 \mathrm { - } \mathsf { m } 1$ instead of $\mathrm { d p 4 - m } 2$ . The dp4 is completely molarized, and its morphology is the same as that of the m1 in having a transversely extended, parallel protolophid and hypolophid. In addition, cement is present in the talonids of dp3-4,while it is lacking in the talonid of the m1. Considering that the bilophodont $\mathrm { m } 1 { - } 2$ are relatively small size, the mandible is more reasonably assigned to Diplolophodon than to Teleolophus.The holotype of $D$ 、xiangshanensis differs from mandibles of the other two species of Diplolophdon in having a smaller size,relatively narrower lower cheek teeth (compared to $D$ 、 lunanensis),cement in the talonids of dp3-4,and incomplete labial cingulids on the lower molars.Huang and Wang (2oo1) reported a mandible with $\mathrm { d p } 3 { - } 4$ instead of $\mathrm { m } 1 { - } 2$ (IVPP V 12471) from the Yuanqu Basin and tentatively assigned it to Teleolophus cf. T. xiangshanensis based mainly on the small size and bilophodonty. This specimen differs from $D$ . xiangshanensis in its lack of cement on $\mathrm { d p } 3 { - } 4$ and has been assigned to $D$ .similis as discussed above.

# 4 The age of Lijiang Fauna

Zong et al.(1996) and Huang (1999) correlated the Lijiang Fauna to the corresponding faunas from the upper part of Lumeiyi Formation of Shilin,the Rencun member of Hedi Formation of Yuanqu,and the Huangzhuang Formation of Qufu. The age of Lijiang Fauna is considered to be ranging from Irdinmanhan to Sharamurunian Asian Land Mammal Ages (Zong et al.,1996; Wang et al., 2021). In terms of revised perissodactyls from the Lijiang Fauna, they are comparable to those from the Rencun member of the Hedi Formation. Four species and two genera are shared between the two faunas: Diplolophodon similis,Prohyracodon meridionale,

Eomoropus minimus, Grangeria canina, Breviodon and Lunania (Huang and Wang, 2001; Huang et al., 20o1; Huang,2Oo2). Three species of the Lijiang Fauna are also reported from the Lumeiyi Formation with certainty: Lunania youngi from the lower part discovered from the nearby locality of Shilin and Diplolophodon similis,Prohyracodon meridionale from the upper part of the localities south of Banqiao (Zhang et al.,1978; Zheng et al.,1978; Russell and Zhai, 1987). Only two species are shared between the Lijiang Fauna and Huangzhuang Fauna: Diplolophodon similis and Eomoropus minimus (Shi, 1989). Here,it is proposed that the age of Lijiang Fauna be restricted to Sharamurunian based on the following evidence: 1) Specimens of Lophialetes and Teleolophus from the Lijiang Fauna, which are typical elements of Irdinmanhan fauna,are considered to be misidentified and reassigned to Diplolophodon; only the genus Breviodon is shared with Irdinmanhan mammals (Bai et al.,2O18); 2) The premolars of Diplolophodon from the Lijiang Fauna has a high molariform degree as seen in Deperetella,which is a typical element of Sharamurunian fauna; 3） The perissodactyls from Lijiang are comparable to those from the Rencun Member of the Hedi Formation,which is considered to be Sharamurunian based on an abundance of small mammal fossils.

摘要：云南西部丽江盆地中始新世丽江组中的哺乳动物群以奇蹄类占据优势，之前已经报道了13个种，丽江动物群的时代被认为从伊尔丁曼哈期延续到沙拉木伦期。重新研究了丽江盆地的部分奇蹄类化石，认为Rhodopagusyunnanensis是Lijiangiazhangi的次同物异名，而后者具有和Lophiohippus相似的特征，所以将Lijiangia置于古兽科(Palaeotheriidae)的Anchilophini,而不是最初有疑问地归入的蹄齿犀科(Hyracodontidae)。Lunania也代表了一类和Paranchilophus相似的古兽而不是爪兽；如果Lophiohippus的正型标本代表了Lunania的上白齿，那么Lophiohippus是Lunania的次同物异名。通过对戴氏模科(Deperetellidae) Diplolophodon的厘定，认为该属包括了3个种：D.similis,D.lunanensis 和D.xiangshanensis(新组合),其中丽江盆地的Teleolophusxiangshanensis应归入到Diplolophodonxiangshanensis。丽江盆地的奇蹄类化石组合和垣曲盆地河堤组任村段的奇蹄类化石相似性最高，且丽江动物群的时代应限于中始新世沙拉木伦期。
