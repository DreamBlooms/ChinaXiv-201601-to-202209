Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cels (MSCs)area reliable cellsourcefortissue regeneration.However,the molecular mechanisms underlying the directed diferentiationof MSCs remainunclear;thus,theiruse is limited.Here,we investigate HOXB7function in theosteogenic diferentiation potentials of MSCs using stemcels fromapical papilla (SCAPs)and bone marrow stem cels (BMSCs).The HOXB7 gene is highly expressed in BMSCs compared with dental tissue-derived MSCs.We found that,in vitro,over-expression of HOXB7in SCAPs enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP)activity and mineralization.HOXB7 over-expresson affected the mRNA expresson of osteonectin (ON),collagenalpha-2(l) chain (COL1A2),bone sialoprotein (BSP),and osteocalcin(OCN),ledto the expressionof the key transcription factor,runt-relatedtranscription factor2(RUNX2),and promoted SCAPosteogenicdifferentiationin vitro.The knock-downofHXB7inhbitedALPactivity,mineralization,andtheexpressionofON,BSP,COLA2,OCN, and RUNX2 in BMSCs in vitro.In addition,transplant experiments in nude mice confirmed that SCAP osteogenesis was triggeredwhen HOXB7wasactivated.Furthermore,Over-expressionof HOXB7significantlyincreased the levels of HOXB7associated withthe BSP promoter by ChIP assays.Taken together,these results indicate that HOXB7 enhances SCAP osteogenic diferentiation by up-regulating RUNX2and directlyactivating transcriptof BSP.Thus,the activation of HOXB7 signaling might improve tissue regeneration mediated by MSCs.These results provide insight into the mechanism underlying the directed differentiation of MSCs.

# Introduction

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipo tent cells that were originally isolated from bone marrow.They can differentiate intoa variety of cell types，including osteoblasts,chondrocytes,myocytes,andadipocytes.Increasing evidence indicates that MsCs are also present in non-bone marrow tissues [1-3]. Recently,a new population of MSCs was isolated from dentaland craniofacial tissuesonthebasis of their stem cell properties.This population included stem cells from the periodontal ligament (PDLSCs), from dental pulp (DPSCs), from apical papilla (SCAPs),and from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) [4-8].These isolated cells were multipotent,exhibited osteo/dentinogenic differentiation，and could self-renew. When transplanted into mice or miniature pigs, they generated bone/dentin-like mineralized tissue,and they were capable of repairing tooth defects [8-1O].MSCsarea reliable resource for tissue regeneration,but the molecular mechanisms underlying their directed differentiation remain unclear; thus,theiruseis limited.

Homeobox genes (HOX) are characterized by a conserved 18O bp DNA sequence coding for a 60aa DNA-binding homeodomain,and themasterregulators in determining patterning,specification，and differentiation during embryonic development [11-13].Homeodomain proteins are transcription factors that can activate or inhibit transcription of downstreamgenes through the DNA binding. Recent studies show that homeobox genes play crucially regulatory roles in the process of maxillofacial and dental development.In Pbx1-deficient mice,absence of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox proteins 1 (Pbx1) caused precocious endochondral ossification and abnormal bone formation by perturbing chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation [14]. HOXA1O could mediate chromatin hyperacetylation and trimethyl histone K4 (H3K4) methylation，induceexpressionof osteogenic genes through activation of RUNX2, or directly regulate other osteoblastic phenotypic genes，and contribute to the onset of osteogenesis and subsequent bone formation [15].More importantly，recent studies have showed that homeobox gene，such as DLX2, DLX5 and HOXC6 as key regulators in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [16-18], indicating that homeobox genes play essential roles in the differentiation of stem cells.Among these homeobox genes,HoxB7 was attracted, since its downregulation in aged MSC was preliminarily observed [19]. HOXB7 regulates several genes playing a significant role in cell proliferation and differentiation[2O-23]. Some researchers found that HOXB7shighly expressed in non-dental tissue-derived MSCs [24],a forced HOxB7 expression was associated with an improved cell growth,a reduction of senescence and an improved osteogenesis [25].However，at present，functional role of HOXB7 in differentiation of human MSCs,especially,the dental tissue derived MSCs,haven't been reported.

Based on those previous findings,we hypothesized that HOxB7 might have an effect on human MSCs.In the present study,we studied human SCAPs and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) to investigate the effects of HOXB7 and the mechanisms underlying these effects. OurresultsindicatedthatHOxB7 could enhance the osteogenic differentiation potential in SCAPs and BMSCs by up-regulating the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and directly activating transcript of bone sialoprotein (BSP).This finding may have practical implications in terms of enhancingthe directeddifferentiation ofMSCsfortissue regenerationapplications.

# Materialsandmethods

# Cell cultures

Tooth tissues were obtained according to approved guidelines set by Beijing Friendship

Hospital, Capital Medical University. Informed patient consent was obtained.

Wisdomteethweredisinfectedwith $7 5 \%$ ethanol and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).SCAPs were gently separated from the apical papilla of the root,PDLSCs were separated from the periodontal ligament in the middle one-third of the root，while DPSCs were separated from crown pulp.Subsequently, the MSCs were digested in a solution of $3 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ collagenase type I (Worthington Biochemical Corp.，Lakewood,NJ,USA) and $4 \ m g / \mathsf { m L }$ dispase (Roche Diagnostics Corp.， Indianapolis, IN,USA) for $^ { 1 \mathfrak { h } }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } .$ .The digested tissues were passed through a $7 0 \ – \mu \mathrm { m }$ strainer (Falcon, BD Labware,Franklin Lakes,NJ, USA) to obtain isolated cell suspensions.Human BMSCs were obtainedfromScienCellResearchLaboratories (Carlsbad,CA，USA).MSCs were grown in a humidified incubator under $5 \% \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ in DMEMalphamodifiedEagle'smedium (Invitrogen,Carlsbad,CA,USA),supplemented with $1 5 \%$ fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 2 mmol/l glutamine, $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m l }$ penicillin,and $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \xi } / { \ m } |$ streptomycin (Invitrogen). The culture medium was changed every 3 days.Cells from passages 2-4 were used in further experiments.

Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK 293T) (American Type Culture Collection,Manassas, VA，USA)cellsweremaintained in complete DMEM medium with $10 \%$ FBS (Invitrogen),100 $\mathsf { U } / \mathsf { m L }$ penicillin,and $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m L } }$ streptomycin (Invitrogen).These cells were utilized for packagingviral constructs.

# Plasmid constructionand viral infection

The plasmids were constructed according to standardmethods,andall constructswereverified with the appropriate restriction digestion analysis and/or sequencing.Human full-length HOXB7 cDNA was obtained by isolating total RNA from cultured BMSCs,then performing reverse-transcriptionandPCRamplification (RT-PCR). Next, the HOXB7 cDNA sequence was fused to a Flag-tag sequence (Flag-HOXB7), with Agel and EcoR1 restriction sites,and subcloned into theT-easy vector(Promega, Madison,WI, USA). The final sequence was confirmed with DNA sequencing. Next, the FlagHOXB7 was subcloned into the pQCXIN retroviralvector(BD Clontech，Mountain View,CA, USA)with the Agel and EcoR1 restriction sites,

HOXB7 enhances MSC osteogenic differentiation and that sequence was also confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)with sequences complementary to those of the target genes were subcloned into the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Addgene,Cambridge,MA,USA).Viral packaging was performed,according to the manufacturer's protocol，with HEK 293T cells (BD Clontech).For viral infections,SCAPs were plated overnight,and then，infected with retroviruses or lentiviruses in the presence of polybrene ( $6 ~ \mu \xi / \mu \nu L$ ，Sigma-Aldrich,St.Louis,MO, USA) for $6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ After $4 8 { \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，infected cellswere selected with the appropriate antibiotics. BMSCs were infected with lentiviruses expressing SMAD4 shRNA (SMAD4sh)，expreSsed HOXB7 shRNA(HOXB7sh)or Scramsh，and selected with $2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathsf { m L }$ puromycin for 7 days. SCAPs were infected with a retrovirus that carried the wild type HOXB7 fused to a Flag-tag or an empty vector,and selected with $6 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / } }$ mL G418 for 1O days. The target sequences for the shRNAs were as follows: HOxB7shRNA (HOxB7sh), 5'-gaggaagagacatgagaaa-3'. A scrambled shRNA (Scramsh) was used as a control (Addgene).The PCR primers used for cloning the HOxB7 gene were as follows: HOXB7Forward， 5'-tcgaaccggtatggattacaaggacgacgatgacaagatgagttcattgtattatgc-3';and HOXB7 Reverse，5'-acgtgaattctcactcttcctcttcctcct-3'.

# Results

HOXB7 over-expression enhanced osteogenic differentiationpotentialin SCAPsinvitro

We used real-time RT-PCR to test the HOXB7 mRNA levels in BMSCs and dental tissuederived MSCs.We found higher HOXB7 expression in BMSCs than in SCAPs，DPSCs，and PDLSCs (Figure 1A).Then we investigated the function of HOXB7 in SCAPs with HOXB7 overexpression.First,we inserted the Flag-HOXB7 sequence into a retroviral vector.This construct induced overexpression of ectopic HOXB7 when transduced into SCAPs via retroviral infection.Ectopic HOxB7 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure 1B). Next,SCAPs transduced with the Flag-HOXB7 orwith the empty vector alone (controls) were cultured in osteogenic-inducing medium to determine the osteogenic differentiation potential.The results indicated that over-expression of HOXB7 strongly increased ALP activity,one of the earliest markers of osteogenic differentiation in SCAPs (Figure 1C,1D).Accordingly, Alizarin Red staining and quantitative calcium measurements showed that mineralization was markedly enhanced in SCAPs infected with Flag-HOXB7 compared to control-infected cells (Figure 1E，1F).Consistent with this finding, real-time RT-PCR results showed that the osteogenicmarker genes，whichencodes extracellular matrix proteins in bone and dentin tissues were changed.The results showed that the overexpression of Flag-HOxB7 in SCAPs was associated with elevated expression of osteonectin (ON) and collagen alpha-2(l) chain (COL1A2) at 7 days (Figure 2A,2D),and bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin (OcN) at 3, 7,and14 days after induction (Figure 2B,2C).

Next,we examined the expression of key transcription factors that regulate osteogenic differentiation，including runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osterix (OSX).We found that the mRNA level of RUNX2 was significantly increasedat3,7,and14 daysafter induction in Flag-HOxB7 overexpressed SCAPs compared to SCAP-Vector cells (Figure 2E). However, the expression levels of OSX were not significantly different between these cell groups (data not shown).

Next,we investigated whether the overexpression of HOXB7 would affect SCAP osteogenesis in vivo.We transplanted control or Flag-HOXB7 SCAPs subcutaneously into nude mice.Eight weeks aftertransplantation,thetransplanted tissues were harvested. The H&E staining revealed that more bone-like mineralized tissuewas present in tissues transplanted with

Flag-HOXB7 SCAPs compared to tissues transplanted with control SCAPs(Figure3A). Qualitativemeasurements of themineralization showed much more mineral in tissues transplanted with Flag-HOXB7 than those transplanted with control SCAPs (Figure 3B).

These transplantation experiments demonstrated that Flag-HOXB7 SCAPs generated more bone-like mineralized tissue than control SCAPs in vivo.Taken together, these results showed that HOXB7 expression substantially triggered osteogenic differentiationin SCAPs.

HOXB7 depletion inhibited the osteogenic differentiationpotentialofBMSCsinvitro

Tofurther elucidate the function of HOxB7in MSCs，we designed a shRNA to target and inhibit HOxB7 expression.We introduced this shRNA (BMSC-HOXB7sh) ora Scramble control shRNA(BMSC-Scramsh) into BMSCs by lentiviralinfection.Afterantibioticselectionof infected BMSCs,we determined that the knockdown efficiency in BMSC-HOXB7sh cells was $70 \%$ with real-time RT-PCR (Figure 4A).To determine whether HOXB7 intrinsicallyaffected osteogenesis in BMSCs，we cultured these transgenic BMSCs in osteogenic-inducing medium.We found that ALP activity was reduced in BMSCHOXB7sh cells compared to BMSC-Scramsh cells (Figure 4B).Two weeks after induction, Alizarin Red staining and quantitative calcium measurementsrevealedthatmineralization was also significantly lower in BMSC-HOXB7sh cells compared to BMSC-Scramsh cells (Figure 4C,4D). Consistent with this finding,real-time RT-PCR results showed that the osteogenic marker genes， ON was down-regulatedin HOXB7-depleted cells at 3,7,and 14 21 days after induction (Figure 5A); BSP was down-regulated in HOxB7-depleted cells at 7,and 14 days after induction(Figure 5B);OCN was strongly inhibited in HOXB7-depleted cells at O, 3,7,and 14 days after induction (Figure 5C); COL1A2 was inhibited in HOXB7-depleted cells at 3,and 14 days after induction (Figure 5D). Next,we examined the expression of key transcription factor that regulate osteogenic differentiation，RUNX2.We found that the mRNA level of RUNX2 was significantly lower at 3,7, and14 days after induction in BMSC-HOXB7sh cells compared to BMSC-Scramsh cells(Figure 5E).

# Discussion

MSCs can differentiate into several cell types, including osteoblasts.The molecular mechanismsunderlyingdirecteddifferentiation remainunclear.HOxB7isa critical member of homeobox genes and plays a key role in regulatingcellfate.Evidenceforthepotentialfunction of HOXB7 in controlling differentiation of stemcellsinvolvedinitscriticalrolesinosteogenesis and age of stem cells [19,25]. Here,we present evidence to extend the functions of HOXB7 to be a critical regulator in maintaining osteogenic differentiation of human post-natal MSCs.

In this study，we investigated the function of HOXB7in the differentiation of MSCs derived from human dental tissues and bone marrow. First，we found that HOXB7 enhanced ALP activity and mineralization in vitro.Moreover, HOXB7 overexpression enhanced osteogenesis in vivo.These findings indicated that HOXB7 might bea keytranscription factor that controls the osteogenic differentiationpotentialof MSCs.

The commitment of MSCs to an osteogenic lineage requires coordinated inhibition of differentiation toward other lineages.Thus, the activation of multiple transcription factors is associated with MSC differentiation [29,3O].Two of the keytranscription factors,RUNX2and OSX, arenecessary for osteogenic differentiation [31-33]. RUNX2 directs the differentiation of MSCs into an osteoblastic lineage,and inhibits them from differentiating into adipocytic and chondrocytic lineages.After differentiating into preosteoblasts,OSX and RUNX2 can drive the cells to become immature osteoblastsand produce bone matrix.As a downstream gene of RUNX2,OSX is a second transcription factor thatis essential for osteogenic differentiation; it is specifically expressed in all developing bones [31-34].Previous study showed that HOXA1O was markedly stimulated in osteoblasts after BMP2 treatment,coincident with the robust expression ofRUNx2[35].Also,we

showed that HOXB7 evoked the significant upregulation of RUNX2，but didn't affect OSX expression,indicating that regulation of HOXB7 onosteogenesismediatedbyRUNX2. Furthermore,HOxB7 induced expression of the ON，COL1A2，BSP，and OCN genes，which encode extracellular matrix proteins.These results suggested that HOxB7 isa key enhancerof osteogenic differentiation.

Inaddition，compared with other osteogenic marker genes,BSPwas significantly induced by HOXB7 after osteogenic induction，suggested HOXB7 might regulated BSP transcript directly. We analysis the promoter of BSP,and identified the specific sequence for HOXB7 binding(tcaattaa)in the BSP promoter.Furthermore,Overexpression of HOXB7 significantly increased the levels of HOXB7 associated with the BSP promoterby ChlP assays at3 days after osteogenic induction.These results indicated that HOXB7 could directly bind with the promoter of BSP and promote its transcript.

In conclusion, this study found that HOXB7 was a positive effector for the osteogenic differentiation ofMSCs via up-regulation of RUNX2 and directly activating transcript of BSP. These results suggested that activation of HOXB7 signalingmight improve tissue regeneration mediatedby MSCs.These results have provided insights into the mechanism underlying directed differentiation of MSCs.
