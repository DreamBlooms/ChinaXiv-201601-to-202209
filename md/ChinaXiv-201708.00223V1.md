# Introduction

Gas sensors haveatracted much atention fordetectingand monitoring flammable,explosive,ortoxic gasesasaresult of the increasingconcern over theeffectsof worseninggas polution on health and safety.Among these gassensors,metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)sensorsarewidelyinvestigated becauseof theirhighsensitivity,lowcost,andeasymaintenance.Seiyama et al.initiallyproposedtheprincipleofgassensingin1962.Consequentlyarious indsofMOShavebeenexploredas gasssors. Samples of $n$ -type metal oxides are $Z \mathrm { n O }$ $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ,In2O3, $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ ，and ${ \bf W } { \bf O } _ { 3 }$ . Several samples of $p$ -type metal oxides are CuO, NiO, $\mathrm { C o } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ ,and $\mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ .3 Among candidate gas sensor nanomaterials, $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ has been extensively investigated given its high conductivity, good stabilityandiologicalfriendliness4However,sveraldrawbacks,suchashighoperating temperature,owssitivityd selectivity,still limit the application of bulk $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ as gas sensor. Numerous studies have been conducted to improve the gas sensing performance of $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ by designing different $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ nanostructures with large surface areas to increase active sites, such as nanocactus,6 porous nanoflakes,8and flower-likestructures.910 Combining noble metalnanoparticles(NPs)(i.e.,，Au,Ag,orPtwith $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ to formhybrid nanostructures isanother eficientstrategytoacquiredesirablesensingperformance.1-14Twotypes ofnoble metalNP $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ hybrid nanostructures,namely,surface modifiedandencapsulated,arecurentlyemployednd generallydesignedtoprove the sensing performance.15-21 The gas sensing performance of sensors can be enhanced bysurface modification becauseof the catalytic effectsofthenoble metalNPsinthedissociationof molecularoxygen(chemicalsensitization）andelectronic interaction for the formation of Schottky junctions between noble metal NPs and $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ (electronic sensitization). However, this approach is still limitedbyseveralissues.Coagulationandchemicalpoisoningofnoble metalNPsoccrathigh working temperature,resultingin thelossofcatalyticactivity.l.2Bycontrast,encapsulatednoble etalNPsare morstabletanthatontesurfacebecausef the protectionofthe surroundingZnOshell.Moreover,theareasofSchottyjunctions inencapsulatedNPs werealsolargerthanthat in surface- modified NPs because of the whole surface contact of Au with the $Z \mathrm { n O }$ shell.However,the catalytic effects of noble metal NPs would inevitably decline and even disappear in some cases.24 Therefore,specific noble metal $\mathrm { \bf N P - Z n O }$ hybrid nanostructuresshouldbedesignedsuchthat thesehybridnanostructures willpossesstheadvantages ofbothchemicalandelectronic sensitization while preserving the stability of noble metal NPs under severe working conditions.

In this paper, we introduce the preparation of novel Au-decorated $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ nanospheres (Au-ZnO NSs) with many small Au NPs encapsulated in $Z \mathrm { n O }$ NSs and relatively larger Au NPs decorated on the surface of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs using laser irradiation of liquids.The Au-ZnONS-basedsensors,asesingaterial,possesstheombinedchemicalandelectronicsensitation.Tesessorseited higher sensitivity and lower working temperature towards ethanol molecules than pure $z _ { \mathrm { n O } }$ NS-based sensors.

# Experimental section

Chemicalsandmaterials

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., while Au $( 9 9 . 9 9 \% )$ andZ $\mathrm { ~ \ i n ~ } ( 9 9 . 9 9 \% )$ metal plateswerepurchased from Beijing GoodwillMetalTechnologyCo.Ltd.(Beijing,China).Ultrapure water wasprepared using a Milli-Q-Plus system.

# Preparation of Au-ZnO NSs

First, the Au colloidal solution was obtained by ablating a piece of Au plate for $3 \mathrm { m i n }$ in an aqueous solution of $1 \ \mathrm { m M } \ \mathrm { N a O H }$ using focused laser of $1 0 6 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ wavelength with energy density of $8 0 \mathrm { m J }$ /pulse (Fig.1). Then, the precursor of colloidal solution containing Au and $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NPs was synthesized by immersing the $Z \mathbf { n }$ plate in $1 8 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of as-prepared Au colloidal solution. The plate was ablated for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ using focused laser of $1 0 6 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ wavelength with an energy density of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m J } } ,$ /pulse. Subsequently, the mixed Au and $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ colloidal solution was further irradiated byunfocused laser with $3 5 5 \mathrm { n m }$ wavelength and energy density of $4 0 \ \mathrm { m J }$ /pulseunder continuous stirring for $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The color of the colloidal solution changed from brown to deep purple after irradiation. Pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs were prepared by similar processes. $Z \mathbf { n }$ colloidal solution was prepared by ablating $Z \mathrm { n }$ plate for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ in an aqueous solution of $1 \ \mathrm { m M } \ \mathrm { N a O H }$ using focused laser of $1 0 6 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ wavelength.Then,the as-prepared $Z \mathbf { n }$ colloidal solution was irradiated with unfocused laser of $3 5 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ wavelength under the same condition.The samples were washed several times with deionized water by centrifugation. Then, the products were collcted and annealed in a muffle furnace at $4 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ for characterization and gas sensing measurements.

# Characterization

The morphologyand structureof theproducts were investigated using field-emisionscaning electron microscopy (SU8020)and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, Japan). The $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { X } }$ -ray diffraction (XRD） patterns of all samples were recorded using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (G2234) with $\mathrm { { C u - K a } }$ radiation $( \lambda { = } 0 . 1 5 4 1 9 \ \mathrm { \ n m } )$ .Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed with afluorescence spectrophotometer (F-460o,Hitachi).A Keithley6487 Source/Measure Unit (SMU) was used to record the change in current and provide a power source during testing of sensor performance.

# Gas sensing Test

The gas sensors were fabricated by dispersing the Au-ZnO NSs (or pure $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs) powders in ethanol or directly coating the powders onthe surfaceofceramic tubes.Gassensing measurement was conductedby injectingacertain volumeof target gas (e.g,ethanol) into the chamber usingamicrosyringe.The target gases inthe chamber werereleased after completionof thegas sensing measurements byflowingfreshdriedairintothechamber.Aconstantvoltage (3V)wasappliedonto thesensor,andthentheurrent was measured and acquired via SMU. The response of the sensor was calculated as folows: Response $= I _ { \mathrm { g } } / I _ { \mathrm { a } }$ ,where $I _ { \mathrm { a } }$ and $I _ { \mathrm { { g } } }$ are the electric currents of the sensor in air and target gas,respectively.

Typical scanning electron micrographs (Fig.2a) and size distribution histogram (inset of Fig.2a) show pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ spherical morphology with an average size of $6 9 \mathrm { n m }$ . Decoration with Au NPs resulted in spherical Au-ZnO NSs (Fig.2b) with average size of $7 3 \ \mathrm { n m }$ (inset of Fig. 2b),which is close to that of pure $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs. The transmission electron micrographs in Figs.2c and d clearly indicated thatAu-ZnONSswere decorated with afew large Au NPsatthe edgeof the surfaces and encapsulated with manysmal Au NPs.Thecoresponding high-resolutiontransmisionelectronmicrograph (Fig.e)oftheareamarkedwithwhitedottedsquare in Fig.2d reveals the highly crystalline nature of the $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs. The clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacing s of O.26 and 0.24 nm correspond to the (Oo2) crystalline plane of hexagonal wurtzite $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ and the(111) crystalline plane of face-centered cubic Au, respectively.Relatedselected-area electron difractionpattrn (Fig.S1)alsoindicated thesingle-crystalinecharacteristicof $z _ { \mathrm { n O } }$ NSs.Furthermore,compared withtheproducts withoutannealing treatment (Fig.S2),teAu-ZnONSsremained spherical,andno coagulationofthe smallAuNPs was found,therebysuggesting thattheAu-ZnONSswere very stable athigh temperature.

The phase structures of as-prepared Zn colloidal NPs,pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs,and $\mathtt { A u - Z n O }$ NSs were further identified by XRD characterization. The diraction patterns in Fig.3a indicate that all three samples contained $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ in hexagonal structure (JCPDS card No. 01-076-0704). By contrast, XRD pattern of $Z \mathbf { n }$ colloids shows broadened peaks of $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ ,indicating small size of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NPs, and three extra peaks with weak diffraction intensity belonging to metallc Zn. Additionally,the peaks at $3 8 . 2 ^ { \circ }$ $4 4 . 4 ^ { \circ }$ ,and $6 4 . 6 ^ { \circ }$ in thedifractiopateofu-ZnONSswereidexed tothe(11),(2O0),and(2)planesofcubic metallcAu(JCPDScadNo.0 004-0784),respectively. The room temperature PL spectrum (Fig. 3b) of pure $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs displays a PL emission peak at $3 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ (3.26 eV)，which could be ascribed to the band edge emission of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ semiconductor.However, the emission intensity declined dramatically when the Au NPs were decorated onto $Z \mathrm { n O }$ . The significant decrease in the PL emission intensity of Au-ZnO NSs should be attributed to the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from $Z \mathrm { n O }$ to Au. This phenomenon suggests that significant electronic interactions occurred between Au and $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$

The products obtained at different irradiation times (O,5, 20,and $4 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ ） were analyzed by TEM to investigate the growth mechanism involved in the synthesis of Au-ZnO NSs (Fig. 4). The product was composed of short $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ nanorods with average diameter of $1 1 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and length of $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ prior to laser irradiation (Fig. 4a). The high-resolution transmission electron micrograph in Fig. 4e displays the clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of O.25 and $0 . 2 4 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ，corresponding to the（1O1）plane of hexagonal wurtzite $Z \mathrm { n O }$ and the(111) plane of cubic Au,respectively. A few irregular spherical NPs with an average size of $4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ was observed after irradiation for $5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ (Fig.4b). The high-resolution transmission micrographs in Figs. 4f and S3 reveal the polycrystaline structure of these irregular spherical aggregates, which comprised many small rod-like $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ and a few Au NPs, as indicated by white arrows. Increasing the irradiation time to $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ resulted in the transformation of the irregular aggregates to NSs with average size of $6 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ (Fig. 4c), which had already exhibited the Au-ZnO hybrid nanostructures (Fig. $\mathrm { 4 g \dot { } }$ ).Further increase in irradiation time to $4 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ resulted in the complete consumption of rod-like $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ nanocrystallines (Fig. 4d), instead of the formation of $\mathrm { z n O }$ NSs (Fig. 4h). However, no obvious increase in the size of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs was found compared with that of the product obtained at $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . This result suggests that the size of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs reached the maximum value under the certain input laser fluence of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m J } .$ /pulse.Thisfindingcouldbereasonably explained byEquation(1),which quantitativelydefines the maximum sizeof particle at certain fluence.25,26

$$
\mathcal { Q } _ { \mathrm { a b s } } ^ { } = J \sigma _ { \mathrm { a b s } } ^ { \lambda } \left( d _ { \mathbf { p } } \right) = \rho _ { \mathbf { p } } \left( \frac { \pi d _ { \mathbf { p } } ^ { 3 } } { 6 } \right) \left\{ C _ { \mathbf { p } } ^ { s } \left( T _ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { } - T _ { 0 } ^ { } \right) + \Delta H _ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { } + C _ { \mathbf { p } } ^ { 1 } \left( T _ { \mathrm { b } } ^ { } - T _ { 0 } ^ { } \right) + \Delta H _ { \mathrm { b } } ^ { } \right\} ,
$$

where $J$ is the laser fluence,and $\sigma _ { \mathrm { \ a b s } } ^ { \lambda }$ is the absorption cross-section.Thus, the required laser fluence $J ^ { * }$ that will heat a particle with diameter of $d _ { \mathrm { P } }$ from room temperature $( T _ { 0 } )$ to the melting temperature ( $\mathrm { \Delta } T _ { \mathrm { m } } )$ and to boiling temperature $( T _ { \mathfrak { b } } )$ could be determined. The density $\rho _ { \mathrm { { p } } }$ ,heat capacities $C _ { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { p } } } ^ { \mathrm { ~ s ~ } }$ for solids and $C _ { \mathfrak { p } } ^ { 1 }$ for liquids, melting heat $\Delta H _ { \mathrm { m } }$ ,and boiling heat $\Delta H _ { \mathrm { b } }$ are physical and thermodynamic constants adopted from Perry.27

The physical heating-melting-evaporating mechanism wasconsidered to beresponsible for the formationof the Au-ZnO NSs, similar to the report of Wang et al.26. $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NPs dispersed in liquids were melted under appropriate input laser fluence. Neighboring melted NPs fusedtogetherandthenremelted into larger NPs because of Brownian movement.Arapid cooling processcaused by surrounding liquids occurred after pulsed laser heating (within 7 ns),leading to the formation of $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs. Some Au NPs were also melted and encapsulated inside $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs during the melting and remelting processes, whereas others were decorated on the surface of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs.

The synergetic effects of Au NPs on gas sensing performance of $z _ { \mathrm { n O } }$ were explored by performing gas sensor experiments using pure $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs and Au-ZnO NSsResponse properties of MOS are highly dependent on its operating temperature.The response of pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs under increasing operating temperature,reached a maximum value of 75 at $3 6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，but the optimum operating temperature of Au-ZnO NSs was $3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，which was lower than that of pure $Z \mathrm { n O }$ NSs (Fig. 5a). The corresponding response value was 3.4 times higher than that of pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs. Figure 5b shows the real-time responses of $_ \mathrm { A u - Z n O }$ NS-based or pure $Z \mathrm { n O }$ NSbased sensor toward different concentrations $( 1 0 { - } 2 0 0 \ \mathrm { p p m } )$ of ethanol at $3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,respectively.We clearly found that the response values of both sensors were almost the same at low concentration $( \leq 2 0 ~ \mathrm { p p m } )$ of ethanol. However, the response of Au$Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NS-based sensor increased rapidly and exhibited 2-4 times more than that of pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NS-based sensor when the concentration of ethanol exceeded $2 0 \mathrm { p p m }$ .The plots of the response value versus concentration of ethanol (Fig.5c) of the pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NS-based or Au-ZnONS-based sensorrevealed that theresponses of both sensors presentedapproximate linear corelation with the concentrationsof ethanol.The stabilityof thegassensor wasalsoconsideredas animportant parameter.Figure5dshows thatthe response of the $\mathtt { A u - Z n O }$ NS-based sensor did not decline and remained constant after six cycled measurements,indicating the excellent stability of the Au-ZnO NS-based gas sensor.

Fig.6Selectivityofpure ZnONS-basedandAu-ZnONS-based sensors onsuccesive exposure to10Oppmof various gasesat $3 6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Selectivity of gas sensor materials is highly significant in practical application.The selectivity of the pure $z _ { \mathrm { n O } }$ NS-based or AuZnO NS-based sensor toward ethanol was evaluated bytesting thesensorsagainst various toxic gases，namely，methanol, formaldehyde,acetone,diethyl ether,benzene,toluene,and chlorobenzene.The responses of both sensors towards $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p p m }$ of different gases at $3 6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ are shown in Fig.6. The Au-ZnO NS-based sensor exhibited enhanced responses compared with the pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NS-based sensor for all gases.Both sensors show good selectivity to ethanol.The Au-ZnO NS-based sensor showeddiveseesposstrtassfllo:metanol,9.5;fadee,4;coe,2.5;ethr 10.4;toluene,19.6;andchorobenzene,0.9.Remarkably,thehghestresponsevalueof52wasobtainedforethanol,dicating that Au-ZnONSs has good selectivityto ethanol.Diferent morphologies with various exposed crystal planes were believed to influencegas sensingand photocatalytic behaviorof metal oxidesbecauseofthe diversechemisorptionabiltiesofthediferent exposed faces.28 The morphology of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ could affect the selectivity of the pure $Z \mathrm { n O }$ -based sensor. Hamedani et al. investigated the responses of $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ with three different morphologies (NP,nanorod,and flower-like) to CO,ethanol and methane.The NP sensor had goodseletivitytoetanol.29Therefor,improvedselectivitytoethanoloftheAu-ZnONS-basedsensorcouldbeatributedtothe spherical morphology of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ and decorated Au NPs.

Thus,we propose the posible gassensing mechanism ofour Au-ZnONS-based sensorbyconsideringthe electronic sensitization and chemical catalytic effects (Fig.7).For pure $Z \mathrm { n O }$ ，the oxygen in air could adsorb on its surface and form oxygen anions by capturing the electrons from its conduction band. This process would lead to high air resistance of $Z \mathrm { n O }$ sensor because of the formation of depletion layer on $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ surface.30.31 However, the presence of Au NPs in Au-ZnO NSs would change the energy band structure of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ as a result of the formation of Schottky barriers.The work function of Au metal $( 5 . 1 \ \mathrm { e V } )$ was larger than that of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ 0 $4 . 6 5 \ \mathrm { e V } )$ . Thus, the conduction band electrons of $Z \mathrm { n O }$ would transfer into Au NPs to form depletion layers between the $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ shell and Au NPs.For Au-ZnO NSs prepared inour experiments,Au NPs were not only decorated on the surface of $Z \mathrm { n O }$ ,but also encapsulated inside.Au NPs under surface decoration could increase the width of depletion layer in $Z \mathrm { n O }$ ,which was caused by oxygen absorption.By contrast, numerous smaler Au NPs would bring numerous depletion layers around them in $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ during encapsulation.Fig.7aillustrates thatthesedepletion layers mightconnect with each otherand wouldevidently increase theair resistance of Au-ZnO NS-based sensor.This result agreed well with the experimentresults in which the airresistance of $\mathbf { A u } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { Z n O }$ （204 NS-based sensor $( 2 . 1 ~ \mathrm { M } \Omega )$ was larger than that of pure $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NS-based sensor $( 1 . 7 \ \mathrm { M } \Omega )$ .This characteristic implies that $\mathbf { A u } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { Z n O }$ NSs could display better sensitivity than pure $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs, which is consistent with the aforementioned results of sensing performance. Inaditiontoelectronicsesitzaton,AuNisosideredasagoodcatalystodisociatemolecularoxygenbecauseoftssllover effect.32-34 Therefore, more molecular oxygen could be absorbed on the surface of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ after the decoration of Au NPs on the surface.

The chemisorbed oxygen anions could react with ethanol molecules to release electrons back to the conduction band of $z _ { \mathrm { n O } }$ when $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ is exposed to reducing gas,such as ethanol (Fig.7b). This process willead to the decrease in the resistance of $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ sensor. Thehigher the amountofchemisorbed oxygen anions,the larger would bethe decreaseinresistance.Thus,compared with pure $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NS-based sensor,theimproved sensitivityof Au-ZnONS-based sensortowards ethanolcould beatributedto both electronic and chemical sensitization.

# Conclusion

We presented the preparation of novel Au-ZnO NSs with many small Au NPs encapsulated in $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs and relatively larger Au NPs decorated on the surface of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs using a laser irradiation of liquid approach. The Au- $. Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs showed perfect structural stability against annealing at $4 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ . The heating-melting-evaporating mechanism was responsible for the disappearance of $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ nanorods and formation of Au $. Z _ { \mathrm { n O } }$ NSs. The Au-ZnO NS-based sensor benefited from the structural stability as a gas sensing material.Thus,this sensor displayed good reproducibility,with unchanged response value during six cycled measurements. $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs sensor showed the highest response value of 75 at the working temperature of $3 6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ However,Au-ZnO NSs sensor showed reduced working temperature of $3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and enhanced sensitivity with the response value of 252 towards ethanol of $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { p p m }$ after the decoration of Au NPs onto the $z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs.Additionally, the $\mathtt { A u - Z n O }$ NSs sensor also displayed high selectivity towards ethanol. This improvedsensingperformancecouldbeatributedtothecatalyticeffectsof thesurface-decoratedAuNPsandtheformation of depletion layers induced by the encapsulated Au NPs.Thus,such stable and hybrid nanostructure Au- $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSs could be candidates for gas sensing materials.
