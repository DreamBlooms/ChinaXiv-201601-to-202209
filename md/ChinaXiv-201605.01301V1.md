# SUMMARY

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent subtype of liver cancer,and it is characterized bya high rate of recurrenceandheterogeneity.Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) may well contribute to both ofthese pathological properties，but the mechanisms underlying theirself-renewal and maintenance are poorly understood. Here，using transcriptome microarray analysis,we identified a long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) termed IncTCF7 that is highly expressed in HCC tumors and liver CSCs.LncTCF7 is required for liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation.Mechanistically, IncTCF7 recruits the SWI/ SNF complex to the promoter of TCF7 to regulate its expression, leading to activation of Wnt signaling. Our data suggest that IncTCF7-mediated Wnt signaling primes liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation.In sum，therefore，we have identified an IncRNA-based Wnt signaling regulatory circuit that promotes tumorigenic activity in liver cancer stem cells,highlighting the role that IncRNAs can play in tumor growth and propagation.

# INTRODUCTION

Liver cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer death in men worldwide (Jemal etal.,2011). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the major histological subtype,accounting for ${ \sim } 7 0 \% { \sim } 8 5 \%$ of cases of primary liver cancer.Unfortunately, the 5-yearsurvival rate of HCC subjects remains poor，and more than 750,000 HCC subjects die each year.Although previous studies identified manyaberrantly expressed protein-coding genes in HCC,novel molecular markers that can help in early diagnosis and risk assessmentare still urgently needed (Ji etal.,20o9; Yamashita and Wang,2013).New therapeutic approaches are likely to derive froman improved understanding of the molecular basis of HCC.

The high rate of recurrence and heterogeneity are the two major featuresof HCC (Visvader，2011).Recent studies have suggested that heterogeneity isa result of the hierarchical organization of tumor cells bya subset of cellswith stem/progenitor cellfeaturesknownas cancerstemcells (CSCs) (Easwaranetal., 2014).These CSCs within tumor bulk display the capacity to selfrenew,differentiate,and give rise to a new tumor (Visvader and Lindeman，2012),accounting fora hierarchical organization of heterogeneous cancer cels and a high rate of cancerous recurrence.Liver CSCscanbeenrichedwithseveraldefinedsurface markers,including epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CD133,CD13,CD90,CD44,CD24,and calcium channel $\alpha 2 \delta 1$ subunit, among others (Haraguchi et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2007; Zhao et al.,2013). However, how liver CSCs sustain their self-renewal remains largely unknown.

Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) are defined as transcripts longer than 2oo nucleotides (nt) thatare $5 ^ { \prime }$ capped and $3 ^ { \prime }$ polyadenylated,yet this class of transcripts has limited coding potential.LncRNAs function in a wide range of biological processes and can regulate gene expression in cis or in trans by diverse mechanisms (Batista and Chang，2013； Cech and Steitz, 2014; Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013). LncRNA-mediated biology has been implicated in many cellular processes (Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013).In cancer, IncRNAs have been reported to act as a prominent layer of transcriptional regulation,often by collaborating with chromatin remodeling complexes (Gupta et al., 2010; Prensner et al.， 2013; Yang et al.， 2013; Yuan et al.， 2014). The SWI/SNF complex is an evolutionally conserved multisubunit complex that mobilizes nucleosomes and remodels chromatin using the energy of ATP hydrolysis (Helming et al., 2014; Wilson and Roberts,2011).The SWI/SNF complexassociateswith transcription factors,coactivators,or coexpressors to regulate gene expression (Tolstorukov et al., 2013; You et al., 2013). Inactivating mutations in several SWl/SNF subunits have been identified invarious human cancers (Jones et al.， 2010;Kadoch et al., 2013;Li et al., 2011), suggesting that mutations of some individual subunits promote tumorigenesis.Additionally, the SWl/SNF complex has been implicated in being involved in controlling mammalian stem cell self-renewal and differentiation (Eroglu et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2013; Zeng et al., 2013). However, how the SWl/SNF complex functions in CSCs remains elusive.In this study,we found that IncTCF7 is required for the self-renewal maintenance of liver CSCs.LncTCF7 recruits the SWI/SNF complex to trigger TCF7 expression, leading to activation of Wnt signaling for priming liver CSC self-renewal.

# RESULTS

# LncTCF7IsHighly Expressed in LiverCSCs

Although CD13 (Haraguchi et al.， 2010) and CD133 (Ma et al., 2007)have been widely used as liver CSC surface markers, CD133 or CD13 alone could enrich more cell populations in HCC cell lines or HCC primary samples (Figures S1A and S1B). Haraguchi et al. (201O) demonstrated that the $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cell fraction exhibited slow growth compared with theircounterpart CD $1 1 3 ^ { - } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { - }$ cells.Moreover,the $\mathtt { C D 1 3 ^ { + } C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ cell fractionwas highly resistant to chemical drug treatments compared with their $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { - } C D 1 3 3 ^ { - } }$ subset. Notably,we observed that the $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cell subsets were successfully enriched in seven cell linesoutofnine HCCcelllineswe testedand in over $90 \%$ of $3 0 { \mathsf { H C C } }$ primary samples we examined (Figure S1B). Thus,we combined CD13 and CD133 to enrich the $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cell fraction and thereby identify themas hepatic CSCs in this study.

We then sorted $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cells，presumptively liver CSCs，from Hep3B，Huh7，and PLC/PRF/5 HCC cell lines. Actually, the $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ subset derived from Hep3B cells significantly enhanced oncosphere formation compared to $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { - } C D 1 3 3 ^ { - } }$ cells ( $1 0 . 3 \% \pm 1 . 3 \%$ versus $2 . 6 \% \pm 0 . 3 \%$ ${ \mathsf p } =$ 0.003) (Figure S1C).In addition，the tumor sphere formation frequencies of $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ and $\mathtt { C D 1 3 ^ { + } C D 1 3 3 ^ { - } }$ subsets of Hep3B cells were $1 0 . 3 \% \pm 1 . 3 \%$ versus $6 . 1 \% \pm 1 . 1 \%$ $( { \mathsf p } =$ 0.0253)； $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ versus $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { - } C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ fractionsof Hep3B cells were $1 0 . 3 \% \pm 1 . 3 \%$ to $5 . 2 \% \pm 1 . 3 \%$ $( \mathsf { p } = 0 . 0 2 2 6 )$ (Figure S1C).Similar observations were obtained using Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Figure S1C). Consistently, the tumor-initiating ability of the $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ subset derived from Hep3B cells was significantly higher than that of $\mathtt { C D 1 3 ^ { + } }$ or $\mathsf { C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ cells alone (Figures S1Dand S1E).Similar resultswereachieved with Huh7 cells.We concluded that the tumorigenic capacity of $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cells was much higher than that of ${ \mathsf { C D } } 1 3 ^ { + }$ or $\mathsf { C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ cells alone.Of note, there was no significant difference in the proliferative capacity between $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cells and $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { - } C D 1 3 3 ^ { - } }$ cells through cell-cycle analysis (Figure S1F). To identify IncRNAs involved in liver CSCs,we conducted transcriptomemicroarrayanalysis of $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { + } C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ cells (hereafter called liver CSCs) and $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { - } C D 1 3 3 ^ { - } }$ cells (hereafter referred to as non-CSCs) sorted from the three above mentioned HCC cell lines.286 noncoding RNA transcripts were aberrantly expressed in liver CSCs compared with non-CSCs (Figure 1A), with some of those differential IncRNAs validated in liver CSCs when we detected ten randomly selected IncRNAs (Figure S1G).

Since IncRNAs can act in cis to regulate expression of neighboring genes or in trans by diverse mechanisms(Rinn and Chang, 2012),we concentrated on intergenic IncRNAs,which were highlyexpressed in liver CSCs and located in the nearbystem transcription factors and coding genes related to stem signaling pathways.Among these highly expressed intergenic IncRNAs, we focused on an uncharacterized IncRNA,termed IncTCF7 (gene symbol TCONS_00009511-XLOC_004555).LncTCF7 is one of the most highly expressed IncRNAs in liver CSCs (Figure1Aand Figure S1G), residing on chromosome 5 in humans between the heat shock70 kDa protein 4(HSPA4) andT cell factor 7 (TCF7) genes (Figure 1B).LncTCF7 was composed of three exonsand spanned nearly 3.6 kilobases (kb),identifying itasa modestlyconserved locus.We further confirmed that IncTCF7 was highly expressed in liver CSCs (Figure 1C),as wellas in oncosphere cells derived from HCC cell lines and HCC primary samples (Figures 1D and 1E).We next examined a cohort of 37 paired HCC tumor and peri-tumor tissues,along with 14 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected liver cirrhotic tissuesand8 normal liver tissues (Table S1).We observed that /ncTCF7was significantly highly expressed in HCC tumors (Figure 1F and Figure S1H) and HCC cell lines (Figure S1l),whereas it was almost undetectable in liver cirrhosis samples and healthy liver tissues (Figure 1F and FigureS1H).Inaddition, IncTCF7wasnotdetectable in some other normal primary tissues we examined (Figure S1J),suggesting a more restricted fashion of IncTCF7 expression.

We further examined the transcripts of IncTCF7 in liver CSCs bynorthern blot.Only one transcriptvariant of IncTCF7was in liver CSCs,with a length between 500 to 1,0o0 bases (Figure 1G). However, IncTCF7 expression was much lower in non-CSCs.A totallength of 683nt of IncTCF7transcriptwasdetermined by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) assay (Figure S1K), which displayed no coding potentiality (Figures S1L and S1M). Furthermore,IncTCF7was localized in the nuclei of HCC tumor cells through RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNAFISH) and cellular fractionation assays (Figures 1H and 1l). LncTCF7 was highly expressed in oncosphere cells,but it was poorly expressed in non-sphere tumor cells.These data indicate that IncTCF7,as an IncRNA,was highly expressed in HCC tumor tissues and liver CSCs.

# LncTCF7IsRequiredforSelf-RenewalMaintenanceof Liver CSCs

Todetermine the role of IncTCF7in liver CSC self-renewal,we silenced IncTCF7 against either exon 1 or 3 in liver CSCs using lentivirus-mediated short hairpins RNAs (shRNAs) (Figure 2A). shRNA-2 (against exon 3) achieved more effective knockdown efficiency.Notably，IncTCF7depletionsignificantlyreduced the expression of pluripotent transcription factors $\mathsf { S o x } 2$ ,Nanog, and Oct4 compared with scrambled control (shCtrl) cells (Figure 2B). By contrast, IncTCF7 knockdown did not affect cMyc expression.Actually,c-Myc was highly expressed in both IncTCF7 silenced and shCtrl liver CSCs，whose expression was not significantly altered in loss-of-function experiments (Figure2B).Additionally, IncTCF7knockdownremarkably impaired generation of the fraction of $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { + } C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ cells (CSCs) (Figure 2C). Importantly， IncTCF7 depletion dramatically reduced primary(1st),secondary (2nd),and tertiary (3rd) oncosphere formation of HCC cellines and HCC primary cells (Figure 2D).

Consistently, IncTCF7 silencing also impaired 2nd and 3rd oncosphere formation derived from their primary oncosphere cells Similar observations were obtained in IncTCF7 silenced PLC/ PRF/5 cells (data not shown).Consequently, IncTCF7 depletion in HCC primary tumor cells significantly reduced the expression of $S o x 2$ and Nanog (Figure 2E). More importantly,we conducted 2nd and 3rd generation xenograft tumor growth for the $\mathsf { C D 1 3 ^ { + } C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ cell subsets derived from HCC cellines and primary samples.We noticed that $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cell populations (A) Geometricmean-centered,hierarchical cluster heat map from microarray data.286 annotated noncoding RNAs $( \mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ wererepresented in liver CSC $( \mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + } )$ compared with nonCSC $( \mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { - } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { - } )$ cells sorted from HCC cell lines,Hep3B,Huh7,and PLC/PRF/5 (PLC).Black arrowheaddenotes IncTCF7.

were still enriched from the 2nd and 3rd generation xenograft tumors (data not shown).The C $\mathtt { D 1 3 ^ { + } C D 1 3 3 ^ { + } }$ cell populations from the 2nd and 3rd generation displayed stronger tumor-initiating capacities (Figure S2A) and oncosphere forming abilities (Figure S2B)，indicating a long-term self-renewal capacity of the $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ cell population. Moreover，Ki67 signals were not apparently altered in liver CSCs compared with non-CSCs (Figure S2C). However, the amount of Sox2 was significantly increased in liver CSCs，but not in non-CSCs.By contrast, IncTCF7 overexpression remarkably enhanced Sox2 signals in liver CSCs,whereas Ki67 was not altered in IncTCF7-overexpressing CSCs compared to empty-vector-treated cells (Figure S2D).Similarobservations were obtained in xenograft tumors (Figure S2E)，suggesting IncTCF7-mediated tumorigenicity in liver cancer is mainly caused by the self-renewal capacity of CSCs.

We next explored the role of IncTCF7 in tumor-initiating formation.We performed subcutaneous injection of BALB/c nude mice with stable knockdown of IncTCF7 and shCtrl cells. LncTCF7 depletion resulted in a much weaker tumor presence compared with shCtrl primary tumor cells as assessed bya limiting dilution xenograft analysis (Figure 2F),suggesting that IncTCF7 knockdown reduced tumor initiating capacity.Moreover， IncTCF7 depletion significantly suppressed xenograft

Overall, IncTCF7 silencing abrogates the tumorigenic capacity of liver CSCs.

factors (Figure 3B)．Notably， IncTCF7 overexpression significantly enhanced oncosphere formation and tumor-initiating capacity (Figures 3C and 3D). Consequently, IncTCF7 overexpression dramaticallyaugmented xenograft tumor growth (Fig ure 3E) and tumorigenic cell frequency (Figure 3F).We tested atleast six HCC primary samples and achieved similar observations.Similar results were also observed in IncTCF7-overexpressed HCC cell lines such as Hep3B and Huh7 cells (Figure S3).All together, these data indicate that IncTCF7 playsa critical role in the self-renewal maintenance of liver CSCs.

# LncTCF7 Triggers TCF7 Expression to Activate Wnt Signaling

Toexplore the target genes of IncTCF7,we established IncTCF7- silenced HCC primary CSC cells and conducted transcriptome microarrayanalysis.LncTCF7knockdown resulted indifferential expression of 2,491 genes (Figure S4A),suggesting that IncTCF7 regulates many genes that relate to important signaling processes including the Wnt signaling pathway (Figure S4B). Notably， IncTCF7knockdown significantly reduced its nearby protein-coding gene TCF7and some major Wntsignaling targets (Figure 4A). By contrast, HSPA4 and the other neighboring genes displayedno significant changes.We then validated these observations in HCC cell lines (Hep3B,Huh7,and PLC) or HCC primary cells (at least six samples). Consistently, IncTCF7 silencing remarkably reduced the expressionofTCF7and majorWnt targets in HCC cell lines and HCC primary cells we examined (Figures 4B and 4C and Figures S4C and S4D). In contrast, IncTCF7 depletion did not alter the expression of HSPA4 and the other neighboring genes (Figures S4C and S4E). In addition, IncTCF7 overexpression in HCC cell lines or HCC primarycells remarkablyenhancedtheexpressionof TCF7andmajorWnttargets (Figure S4F).These data suggest that IncTCF7 activates the Wnt signaling pathway in HCC.

We further tested the expression levels of IncTCF7 and TCF7 in HCC subjects by quantitative real-time PCR.We noticed that IncTCF7 expression was positively correlated with the expression of TCF7 (Pearson correlation coefficient $\mathsf { r } = 0 . 6 9 3$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \cdot }$ (Figure 4D).To determinewhether IncTCF7 functions upstream of TCF7 in the regulation of liver CSC self-renewal, we rescued TCF7 expression in IncTCF7-silenced HCC cells (Figure4E). Interestingly,TCF7 restoration rescued the oncosphere formation ability reduced by IncTCF7 depletion (Figure 4F). Additionally,TCF7 restorationalso rescued IncTCF7-depletionreduced tumor-initiating capacityand xenograft tumor growth (data not shown). LncTCF7 silencing dramatically downregulated expression of some major Wnt molecules，including Wnt7a，Wnt4,and Wnt2b (Figures 4A and 4B).Among these threeWntmolecules,IncTCF7depletion reduced expression of Wnt7a the most.To further validate whether Wnt7a is a downstream effectorof IncTCF7，weincubated IncTCF7-silenced HCC primary CSCs with recombinant Wnt7a for a sphere formationassay.We found thatWnt7a rescued the oncosphere formation ability reduced by IncTCF7 depletion (Figure S4G). Additionally，Wnt7a also restored the expression levels of TCF7，Sox2，and Nanog in IncTCF7-depleted HCC primary CSCs (Figure S4H). DKK1 (Dickkopf-related protein 1) was reported to be an extracellular inhibitor of Wnt signaling (Cui et al.,2013).The presence of DKK1 was able to abolish the oncosphere formationabilityenabledby IncTCF7overexpression (Figure S4l).Consistently，DKK1 treatment also impeded the expression levelsofTCF7,Sox2,andNanog in IncTCF7-overexpressing HCC primary CSC cells (Figure S4J).These data suggest that IncTCF7 sustains the self-renewal of liver CSCs upstream of TCF7.

To further explore the clinical implications of TCF7 in HCC,we analyzed the expressionof TCF7 in HCC tumorand peri-tumor tissues.We observed thatTCF7 was highly expressed in HCC tumors (Figure 4G). Additionally，TCF7 was mainly localized in the nuclei of HCC oncosphere cells,whereas itwas almost undetectable in non-sphere cells (Figure 4H).High expression ofTCF7 in HCC samples was further confirmed by immunohistochemistrystaining (Figure 4l).Importantly,high expression of TCF7 predicteda lower rate of 5-year survival in members of a cohort analyzed by Hoshida et al. (20o9) (Figure 4J). Next, we silenced TCF7 in HCC cells and established stably silenced cell lines (Figure 4K).Notably, TCF7 depletion suppressed Sox2 expression.We observed that TCF7 silencing dramatically impaired oncosphere formation, tumor initiating capacity,and xenograft growth in HCC cell lines and primary cells (Figures 4L-4N,and data not shown). In sum, IncTCF7 initiates TCF7 expression to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to priming of liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation.

# LncTCF7 Recruits the SWI/SNF Complex

LncRNAs are considered to exert their functions through RNAinteractingproteins that regulate geneexpression byvarious mechanisms (Geisler and Coller,2013).Therefore,we performed anRNA pull-downassaywith biotin-labeled IncTCF7 to search forpotential IncTCF7-associated proteins.BRG1, BAF170,and SNF5,three core subunits of the SWl/SNF complex,were identified to bind IncTCF7 in liver CSCs (Figures 5A and 5B and Figures S5A-S5C).The interactionof IncTCF7with the three SWI/ SNF components was further validated by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) (Figure 5C and Figure S5D).However， IncTCF7 depletion did not influence expression levels of BAF170, BRG1,and SNF5 (Figure 5D), suggesting that IncTCF7 was not involved in the post-translational regulation of the SWl/SNF complex.Moreover，IncTCF7 colocalized with BAF170 in the nuclei of HCC oncosphere cells,whereas IncTCF7 was poorly expressed in the nuclei of non-sphere cells (Figure 5E). These dataindicate that IncTCF7 associateswith the SWl/SNF complex in the nuclei of liver CSCs.

We next constructed a series of IncTCF7truncations to map its binding fragment with the SWl/SNF complex.We found that the $3 ^ { \prime }$ -end fragment of IncTCF7 (nt 468 to 683) was sufficient to bind BAF170, BRG1,and SNF5 (Figure 5F). A stable stem-loop structure of the $3 ^ { \prime }$ -end fragment was predicted by RNA folding analysis (Figure S5E). The binding of the $3 ^ { \prime }$ -endregionof IncTCF7 with BAF170 was further confirmed by an RNA electrical mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Figures 5G and 5H).Unlabeled IncTCF7 probes competitivelydisrupted this bindingcapacity.Additionally,IncTCF7showed high bindingaffinity(dissociationconstant [Kd] $3 6 . 2 4 ~ \mathsf { n M } )$ (Figure 5l).These data indicate that IncTCF7 directly binds to the SWl/SNF complex with high affinity.

# LncTCF7 Triggers TCF7 Expression to Activate Wnt Signaling

Given that the SWl/SNF complex regulates gene transcription by binding to promoter loci and refoldingchromatin (Robertsand Orkin，2004)，we then detected whether IncTCF7 influenced BAF170 occupancy of the promoter locus of the TCF7 gene. Weanalyzeda3kb locus upstream from the transcription start sites(TSSs) of the TCF7 gene.We found that IncTCF7 depletion abrogated the binding capacityof BAF170with (approximately)a -1,160 to -1,048 bp segment of TCF7 promoter (Figure 6A), suggesting that this segment was the binding site for IncTCF7. Through luciferase reporter assays，we identified (approximately)a -1,200 to -1,100 bp segment of TCF7 promoter asasufficient binding site for BAF170 (Figures 6B-6D).Finally, we observed via a DNase 丨 digestion assay that IncTCF7 or BAF170 knockdown significantly impaired the chromatin accessibility of the TCF7 locus (Figure 4E).By contrast,BAF170was not recruited on the promoters of the stem pluripotent factors, asassessed throughchromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) analyses (Figures S6A-S6D),suggesting that BAF170 had an indirect effect on the expression of stem pluripotent factors.These data suggest that IncTCF7 recruits the SWI/SNF complex to the TCF7 promoter, thereby leading to its activation.

Notably,the SWl/SNF complex was highly expressed in HCC tumors and liver CSCs (Figure 6F and data not shown), suggesting that the SWl/SNF complexmay be implicated in the regulation of liver CSC self-renewal. Consequently, BAF170 depletion dramatically reduced expression of TCF7 and Nanog (Figure 6G)，as well as Wnt downstream targets such as Sox2, CCND1,and CCND2.Additionally,BAF170 knockdown significantly impaired the ability of oncosphere formation derived from HCC cellines and HCC primary cells (Figure 6H). Finally, BAF170 knockdown also remarkably reduced tumor-initiating capacityand xenograft tumor growth (Figures 6l-6K).Similar results were observed by depleting SNF5 and BRG1 (data not shown)．All together，our data show that IncTCF7 triggers TCF7 expression through recruitment of the SWl/SNF complex, leading to priming of the self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumor initiation.

# DISCUSSION

Recently，CSCs have been identified in many solid tumors, including breast, lung,liver,brain,colon,prostate,and bladder cancers (Haraguchi et al., 2010; O'Brien et al.， 2007;Visvader andLindeman,2012).CSCs have stemcharacteristics such as self-renewal and differentiation.CSCs may account for cancer relapse and metastasis due to their invasive and drug-resistant capacities (Gupta et al.,20o9).Several surface markers have beenidentified in liver CSCs.However，details of liver CSC biology remain largely unknown.In this study,we isolated the $\mathsf { C D } 1 3 ^ { + } \mathsf { C D } 1 3 3 ^ { + }$ subpopulation of cells from HCC cell lines and HCC primary cells and identified themas liver CSCs.Through transcriptome microarray analysis,we identified 286 differentially expressed noncoding RNAs in liver CSCs.Among these highly expressed IncRNAs in liver CSCs,we defined an IncRNA termed IncTCF7 that plays a critical role in priming the selfrenewal of liver CSCs.

LncRNAs have been reported to play widespread roles in gene regulation and other cellular processes (Batista and Chang, 2013; Flynn and Chang，2014).LncRNAs exert their functions via diverse mechanisms,including cotranscriptional regulation, modulation of gene expression, scaffolding of nuclear or cytoplasmic complexes,and pairing with other RNAs (Ulitsky and Bartel，2013)．Notably，accumulating evidence shows that IncRNAs modulate gene expression as epigenetic modifiers (Kaneko et al., 2014; Klattenhoff et al., 2013; Prensner et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2013). Here we found that IncTCF7 activates TCF7 expression in cis through recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex. TCF7 expression triggers Wnt signaling to initiate self-renewal of liver CSCs.Although IncTCF7 isexpressed in the antisense direction,it fails to form an IncTCF7- TCF7 mRNA complex for the regulation of TCF7 expression. The Wntsignalingplaysapivotal role inself-renewal and differentiation of CSCs (Hoffmeyer et al., 2012; Myant et al., 2013). Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is implicated in liver cancer and other chronic liver diseases (Huch et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2013a).Here we show that depletion of TCF7 and Wnt downstream target genes impairs the self-renewal of liver CSCs and their tumor-initiating capacity,suggesting that TCF7-mediated

Wntsignaling is critical forsustaining liver CSC self-renewal and tumorigenicity.

CSCs harbor the stem cell properties of self-renewal and differentiation (Visvader and Lindeman,2012).In this study，we found that there wasno significant difference in the proliferative capacity between liver CSCs and non-CSCs,as assessed by cell-cycle analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Actually, CSCs exist mainly in the G1/G0 phase or G0 phase with dormant or slow-growing properties (Haraguchi et al.,201O). As such, it might be hard to distinguish the proliferation differences between liver CSCs and non-CSCs via Ki67 staining or DNA contentsassayed by propidium iodide (Pl).Also,the self-renewal properties of different cancer typesmay have different proliferation characteristics.The maintenance of self-renewal isan extremely complicatedbiological process，which is controlled byepigenetic states,pluoripotent transcription factors,epigenetic complexes，and many developmental pathways (Boumahdi et al., 2014; Ohnishi et al., 2014; Visvader and Lindeman, 2012).Our data support the idea that IncTCF7-mediated Wnt signaling activation in hepatic CSCs plays a critical role in the regulation of liver CSC self-renewal.

TCF7,as a T cell factor,is best known for its function in T lymphocyte development and multipotential hematopoietic cell self-renewal (Weberet al.，2011).TCF7 can initiate the Wnt signaling cascade as an upstream trigger (Cui et al., 2013; Weber et al., 2011). $T C F 7 ^ { - / - }$ mice developed intestinal and mammary adenomas,implying a role for TCF7 in tumor suppression (Yu et al.，2012). In this study，we demonstrate thatTCF7 is required for the self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumor propagation and acts as a tumor promoter.TCF7 is regulated by IncTCF7 in liver CSCs to trigger the Wnt signaling pathway，which primes the self-renewal of liver CSCs.A recentstudy reported thatTCF7 functionsasatumorenhancer intumorigenesis after ocular transplantation of embryonic stem cell-derived retinal progenitor cells (Cui et al.，2013). Consistently，our findings reveal that IncTCF7mediated TCF7 expression,which initiates the Wnt signaling cascade to prime self-renewal of liver CSCs and hepatic tumorigenicity as a tumor promoter.CSCs are analogous to tissue-specific stem cells in that they contribute to long-term growth and are responsible for the maintenance and growth of tumors (Beck and Blanpain， 2013)． Transcriptional regulationis oneof the key regulatory mechanisms determining cell fate, which includes cis-regulatory elements and transacting factors. Amongall transacting factors,chromatin remodeling regulation plays a pivotal role in gene transcription (Krasteva et al., 2012; Narlikar et al., 2013),which depends on ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes.The SWl/SNF complex is composed of 12-15 subunits containing one of the two catalyticATPase subunits，SMARCA4/BRG1 or SMARCA2/BRM, and several core components such as SMARCB1/SNF5, BAF170,and BAF155 (Helming et al., 2014; Wilson and Roberts,2011).The SWI/SNF complex regulates gene expression through mobilizing nucleosomes and remodeling chromatin using the energy of ATP hydrolysis,suggesting its critical role in gene expression. Inactivating mutations in several SWl/SNF subunits cause various human cancers (Helming et al.,2014; Jones et al.，2010； Kadoch et al.，2013)，suggesting that some components act as tumor suppressors.A recent study reported that the long noncoding RNA SChLAP1 associates with the SNF5 subunit to promote prostate cancer progress by antagonizing the function of the SWl/SNF complex (Prensner et al.,2013),which implies that SNF5 functions as a tumor suppressor.Here we found that IncTCF7 can recruit the SWI/SNF complex to trigger TCF7 expression, leading to priming of liver CSC self-renewal.Additionally，we observed that BAF170,BRG1,and SNF5 are highly expressed in HCC specimens and liver CSCs,whose depletion impairs tumor-initiating capacity and tumor propagation (Figure 6,and data not shown), suggesting that these three components act as tumor promoters.Therefore，how the SWI/SNF complex components function in tumorigenesis remains to be further investigated.

In conclusion, IncTCF7 can promote liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation through activation of Wnt signaling by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to the TCF7 promoter. Our findings reveal that IncRNAs may represent an additional layer of regulation of oncogenesis.

# EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

# Northern Blot Analysis

Total RNA,extracted as described (Wang et al.,2013b) from human CSC oncospheres and control cells,was subjected to northern blot assays.An IncTCF7-specific DNA sequence (nt320-683) was cloned into pcDNA4/mychis B Vector.Radioactive RNA probe with a length of 363 nt was generated using [α- $^ { 3 2 } \mathsf { P l }$ CTP (Perkin Elmer) and the Riboprobe in vitro transcription labeling system (Promega).

# RNA-FISH

Fluorescence-conjugated IncTCF7 probes were used for RNA-FISH. RNA-FISH was performed as previously described (Wang et al.，2014). Hybridization was carried out using DNA probe sets (Biosearch Technologies)according to the protocol of Biosearch Technologies.Oncosphere and control cells were observed with a FV1oo0 confocal laser microscope (Olympus).

# RNA Pull-down and Mass Spectrometry Assay

RNA pull-down was performed as described (Klattenhoff et al., 2013). In vitro biotin-labeled RNAs (IncTCF7,itsantisense RNA,and two control RNAs from two introns of IncTCF7)were transcribed with the biotin RNA labeling mix (Roche) and T7 RNA polymerase (Roche) treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) and purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (QlAGEN).Biotinylated RNA was incubated with HCC oncosphere cell nuclear extracts,and pull-down proteins were run on SDS-PAGE gels as described (Xia et al.,2013).Mass spectrometry followed.

# RNA-EMSA Assay

EMSA experiments were performed using a LightShift Chemiluminescent RNA EMSA Kit (Thermo Scientific).The shifted signals were quantified and plotted against the amount of BAF170 protein with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad).

# Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed with a double-sided Student's t test using the SPSS13.0 software and GraphPad Prism 6.Tumorigenic cellfrequency was calculated based on extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/ software/elda/). $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ was considered statistically significant.For other methods see the Supplemental Information.
