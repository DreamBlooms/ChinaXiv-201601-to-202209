# Introduction

Low temperature (less than $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ）heat as factory exhaust heat or hot spring heat is almost all thrown away. Most of the low temperature heat energy is not used at present.More than 3ooo hot spring resorts with accommodation[1] exist in Japan.Although the electric power generation by using the binary cycle [2] or the thermoelectric conversion element [3] is beginning to be tried at some places, but the construction of equipment involves large costs. The installation of expensive large equipment is needed to gain the output from the low temperature heat energy. Enlarging of equipment is brought by expansion in the heat exchange part and so on. The long generated electric output selling period is needed for cost recovery.

The final purpose of this research is the development of low temperature difference drive engine supposing use in a hot spring resort as a motor for small electric power generation. In order that travelers can enjoy seeing it, the number of rotations of the engine is established at low speed.An engine cycle of this study is aimed at the Stirling cycle which can maintain high efficiency also in small size. This kind of engine has simple structure,it brings low cost,and it is easy to perform maintenance. However, it is difficult to obtain enough output by this type of engine,because of its low temperature difference. Authors found out the increasing effect of engine output byadding a little phase change material which has the boiling point between the source of high temperature and the source of low temperature in a work-fluid [4]. This paper deals with increasing of engine cycle output by using work-fluid including phase change material. The work-fluid is flown into the heating or cooling surface from the narrow path on cycle process.Some researches [5-7] on heat transfer evaluation of a work-fluid have been published, but these studies were examined by using a single phase gas as work-fluid.In order to increase the cycle output, a little amount of Diethylether $( \mathrm { C _ { 4 } H _ { 1 0 } O }$ molecular weight $7 4 . 1 2 ~ \mathrm { g / m o L }$ ， density $0 . 7 1 3 4 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ on liquid phase,boiling point $3 4 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,colorless liquid),as a phase change material, is added to base work-fluid (air).

# ExperimentalProcedure

# Experimental apparatus

Fig.1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus of this study. The experimental apparatus consists of a test section,an actuator,a data logger and the 2 set of constant temperature bathes.The test section is made of the clear acrylic resin,and thermal insulation panels $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in thickness have been stuck on the internal surface.The inner size of the test section is $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in height, $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in width and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in length.The upper surface and the bottom surface of the test section are made of copper plate $3 \ \mathrm { m m }$ in thickness,and are a cooling area and a heating side, respectively. The cooling and heating surface temperature are measured by 6 points of K type thermocouples that have $0 . 1 8 \ \mathrm { m m }$ diameter. The heating and cooling surface temperature are controlled within $\pm 0 . 2 \mathrm { K }$ of the experimental condition. The pressure change in the experiment is measured by the pressure sensor (Keyence AP-43,range $0 { \sim } + 1 . 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { M P a }$ resolution $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { k P a }$ ，response time 1 ms) that is attaching to the acrylic test section wall.Putting the phase change material into the test section is performed using digital burette (Continuous $\mathrm { ~ E ~ } 2 . 5 \mathrm { \ m L / r e v . }$ ,minimum scale 0.01 $\mathrm { m L }$ ，accuracy $\pm 0 . 2 \%$ ).A displacer piston that is set in the test section is connected to an actuator (Misumi single axis robot RSD2 position accuracy $\pm 0 . 0 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，maximum load $2 5 ~ \mathrm { k g }$ ，stroke $5 0 ^ { - } 3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ）through a SUS seal rod 中 $3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in diameter),and is moved up and down by computer control. The increasing of pressure in the test section is caused by moving of displacer piston to upper side The upper side work-fluid is flowed to bottom side by raise of displacer piston. The pressure of the test section is increased by heat exchange between work-fluid and hot heat transfer surface.The decreasing of pressure is brought by moving of displacer piston to bottom side. The heat exchange cycle experiment is carried out on each condition.Work-fluid is passed through $3 \ \mathrm { m m }$ gaps (length of $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ）of side wall by up-and-down motion of a displacer piston. The process distance of a displacer piston is $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ：

# Thermophysical properties of test work-fluid

The work-fluid of this study is air or air-diethylether mixture.Diethylether is selected as the phase change material which has the boiling point in temperature range between heating and cooling surface temperature.Table 1 shows the thermophysical properties of air and diethylether. For example, the quantity of $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { m a s s ^ { 0 } / 0 }$ addition at $2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ of diethylether is $0 . 1 1 1 4 \mathrm { m L }$ or $\boldsymbol { 0 . 0 7 9 5 3 \mathrm { g } }$

# Experimental procedures

The heat exchange cycle experiment is performed by the following procedures.

(1)Exhaust the work-fluid which remains to test section by vacuum pump.

(2)Air as a work-fluid of the temperature of $2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and pressure $1 0 1 . 3 \ \mathrm { k P a }$ (absolute humidity at this time is $0 . 0 1 1 2 \pm 0 . 0 0 0 7 ~ \mathrm { k g / k g ^ { * } } )$ is introduced into test section. Diethylether of specified quantity is thrown into test section by using digital burette.

(3)A cooling surface and a heating surface are set to the experimental condition temperature.

(4) The displacer piston starts to move to the upper side from the bottom side.The heat exchange cycle is continued. Then，the pressure variation reaches to the stable cycle.At this time,the pressure,heat transfer surface temperature,and work-fluid temperature of test section are measured, and it collects in a data logger.

# Experimental conditions

Table 2 indicates the experimental conditions of this study.Temperature differenceofheat source is setas $5 5 -$ 70K containing the boiling point of phase change material.The high temperature heat source is set ${ < } 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ that aims as source temperature of hot spring. The low temperature heat source is maintained $1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .The speed of a displacer piston is set as low-speed rotation $N = 5 { - } 2 0$ $\mathbf { r } / \mathrm { m i n }$ 1 $( u _ { m c } = 0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 0 . 9 ~ \mathrm { m / s } )$ ). The mixed rate to the workfluid (air) of PCM(diethylether) is evaluated in $A _ { d d } = 0 \sim$ $4 \mathrm { m a s s \% }$

Fig.2 indicates the time history of displacer piston position and velocity at this experimental condition.The position of a displacer piston is decided by the rotation angle regardless of number of revolutions. Sine wave operation is performed in the cycle process of a displacer piston, because a displacer piston on the actual engine is controlled by rotation angle. The displacer piston operates by the computer controlled actuator. The heating process times are 1.5 seconds at $2 0 ~ \mathrm { r / m i n }$ ,3.0 seconds at $1 0 ~ \mathrm { r / m i n }$ and 6.0 seconds at $5 \mathrm { r / m i n }$

The cycle output is examined by using the cycle mean velocity on each number of rotations.The cycle mean velocity $u _ { \mathrm { m c } }$ is calculated by the following equations.

$$
H = S t \times \sin \theta
$$

$$
u = \frac { N } { 6 0 } \frac { \Delta H \times W _ { D P } \times D _ { D P } } { 2 \times H \times D _ { D P } }
$$

$$
u _ { m c } = \frac { 1 } { t _ { p r } } \int _ { - 0 . 5 \pi } ^ { 0 . 5 \pi } \ u d \theta \ \quad ( t _ { p r } \equiv 0 . 1 \mathrm { s e c } )
$$

Fig.3 indicates the variation of the cycle mean velocity on the heat transfer surface with number of revolutions. The cycle mean velocity is related linearly to the number of rotations.

Fig.3Variation of cycle mean velocity with number of revolutions.

The cycle mean velocity is estimated by the following equations as Reynolds number $R e$ (using an averaged flow velocity of the process on each number of rotations). The characteristic length is set to 1/2( $\mathrm { \Delta } L = 0 . 1 5 \mathrm { \ m } )$ ofheat transfer surface width, because the work-fluid flows into the center from both ends.The amount of additional phase change material is very little,so that the dynamic viscosity ofair is used for calculation.

$$
R e = \frac { u _ { m c } L } { \nu _ { a i r } }
$$

The quantity of heat which a work-fluid receives in heat exchange process is calculated by the following equation with the application of a constant-volume change.

$$
q = G _ { w } C _ { w } { \biggl ( } { \small P _ { 0 } } _ { } T _ { i } - T _ { i - 1 } { \biggr ) }
$$

In which, $C _ { w }$ and $G _ { w }$ are the specific heat at constant volume and the mass of work-fluid. These values are calculated by using the thermophysical properties of composition.

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { C _ { w } = C { \nu } _ { a i r } G _ { a i r } + C { \nu } _ { d } G _ { d } } } \\ { { G _ { w } = \left( 1 - A d d \right) \times G _ { a i r } + A d d \times G _ { d } } } \end{array}
$$

The quantity of heat in a cycle which a work-fluid receives is calculated by next integral equation.The obtained heat amount equals output per cycle.

$$
\mathcal { Q } = \oint _ { } ^ { } q d \theta = W
$$

The output improvement effect by the PCM addition is estimated by the output ratio.The output ratio is defined by next equation.

$$
{ W ^ { \ast } = W _ { A d d } / W _ { a i c } }
$$

The temperature difference ratio is calculated by the following equation using PCM boiling point.

$$
T ^ { * } { = } \big ( T _ { 1 } { - } T _ { 2 } \big ) / \big ( T _ { b } { - } T _ { 2 } \big )
$$

The experimental data are indicated by the plots in this figure.The curved lines show the approximation values that are obtained from experimental data. Output reaches the stable value by driving for more than 8O seconds in spite of the condition.Therefore the data of drive time after 120 seconds as the stable cycle are used in this study.

Fig.6 shows the variation of the output per cycle with the number of revolutions at $A _ { d d } = 0 ~ \mathrm { m a s s \% }$ (air). Cycle output decreases with the increasing of the number of rotations.Because the decreasing of heat exchange time is brought by the increasing of number of rotations.
