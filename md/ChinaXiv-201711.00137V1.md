1 INTRODUCTION

In recent decades,transition-metal complexes have obtained long-lasting attention owing to their special structures and extensive applications in catalysis,adsorption,electric conducting materials,magnetic and optical materials,and so on[1-4].Among transition metals,copper is an important element in coordination chemistry,catalysis chemistryand amicroelement necessaryto lifel[5-8].Its flexible coordination modes makeit easy to form mononuclear, dinuclear and multinuclear complexes[9,iol. Pyrazole carboxylates as a kind of multifunctional ligands play an important role in generating excellent architectures because of some advantages: firstly，the multidentate organic ligands possess potential coordination nodes and the strong coordination ability,and they exhibit diverse chelating and bridging modes;secondly,pyrazole carboxylates also act as the multiple proton donors and acceptors,and may build high-dimensional supramolecular frameworks by hydrogen-bonding or $\pi { - } \pi$ stacking interactions.However, few examples are reported with the transition-metal complexes based on $1 H \cdot$ -pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid owning to only one carboxyl group in the ligand1-31. And it remains a significant challenge to synthesize such pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid complexes and develop their catalytic activities in some organic reactions.

Herein, we report the syntheses and structural characterizations of the mononuclear copper complex 1 and dinuclear copper complex 2, which were obtained by the room temperature conditions or hydrothermal method. The two copper complexes have been fully characterized by SXRD,PXRD,elemental analyses,TGA and FT-IR spectroscopy. Complexes 1 and 2 were further investigated as catalysts for the oxidation of alkylbenzenes with TBHP as an oxidant.

# 2.4Procedure for the catalytic oxidation of alkylbenzenes

Alkylbenzenes ( $\mathrm { 0 . 2 5 \ m m o l }$ ),copper complex( $( 5 \mathrm { m o l } \%$ ), $70 \%$ TBHP (0.625 mmol) and benzonitrile (2 mL) were added to a $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ flask,and the catalytic reaction was performed at $7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .After the reaction was completed, the resulting mixture was analyzed by GC-MS and GC.

# 2.5 Reuse experiments

The reuse experiments were carried out for the oxidation of diphenylmethane under the optimum conditions. After the reaction was completed, the catalyst was retrieved by filtration ( ${ 5 . 8 } \mathrm { m g }$ $9 6 \%$ recovery), washed with MeOH (ca. $3 ^ { * } 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ),and air-dried prior to being used for the reuse experiment.The PXRD spectrum of the retrieved catalyst was identical to that of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 6). In addition,the retrieved catalyst could be reused for the second run of oxidation of diphenylmethane. After the second run reaction was completed, the catalyst was retrieved by filtration ( ${ 5 . 5 } ~ \mathrm { m g }$ $9 5 \%$ recovery),washed with MeOH (ca. $3 ^ { * }$ （204号 5mL),and air-dried prior to being used for the third run experiment.The experiment of the third run was prepared in the same way as that for the second run,and finally the $9 5 . 7 \%$ conversion of diphenylmethane was also determined by GC.The PXRD spectrum of the third run retrieved catalyst was identical to that of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 6).

# 2.6 Structure determination

Single-crystal $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { X }$ -ray diffraction data for complexes 1 and 2 were performed with MoKa radiation $\langle \lambda =$

0.71073 A） on a Bruker-AXS CCD diffractometer equipped with multi-scan technique at 296 K. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined through full-matrix least-squares techniques method on $F ^ { 2 }$ using the SHELXTL 97 crystalographic software packagel14,15]. The final refinements included anisotropic displacement parameters for allatoms.The selected bond lengths,bond angles and hydrogen bond parameters of 1 and 2 are shown in Tables 1 and 2,respectively.

# 3 RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

# 3.1Structure description of $\mathbf { C u } ( \mathbf { H p c a } ) _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } ) _ { 2 } { \cdot } 2 \mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ (1)

The single-crystal $\mathrm { \Delta } X$ -ray difraction reveals that complex 1 contains one crystallographically independent $\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + }$ ion,one Hpca anion and one coordination water molecule. As shown in Fig.la, the ${ \mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ ion is surrounded by two oxygen atoms, two nitrogen atoms (O(1), O(1A), N(1) and N(1A) from two Hpca anions,and two oxygen atoms (O(3)， O(3A)） from two coordinated water molecules,and it exhibits a distorted $\{ \mathrm { C u O } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \}$ ：octahedral geometry. The bond distances of the $\mathrm { C u - O }$ and $\mathrm { { C u - N } }$ are $1 . 9 9 0 1 ( 1 9 ) \sim$ 2.508(2) and 1.976(2) $\mathring \mathbf { A }$ ,respectively, which are similar with those of reported copper complexes[16]. The bond angles around $\mathrm { C u ^ { 2 + } }$ ion are in the range of $8 1 . 4 4 ( 8 ) { \sim } 1 8 0 . 0 . 0 0 ( 5 ) ^ { \circ }$ . The $\mathrm { { H p c a } ^ { - } }$ anion adopts a chelate coordination mode: one oxygen atom and one nitrogen atom of $\mathrm { { H p c a } ^ { - } }$ anion act as coordination atoms connecting the adjacent $\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + }$ ions, forming a five-membered ring. The adjacent mononuclear structures are connected by two kinds of hydrogen bonding interactions to form a 1D supramolecular chain, in which the first hydrogen bonding interaction is formed by the oxygen atoms (O(3))of coordinated water molecules and the carboxylic oxygen atoms (O(1)) of Hpca anions with the O(3)-H(3C).:O(1) distance of 2.737(5)A,and the second hydrogen bonding interaction is formed by oxygen atoms (O(3)） and nitrogen atoms (N(2) of pyrazole rings from Hpca anions with the $\mathrm { N } ( 2 ) { \mathrm { - H } } ( 2 ) { \cdot } \cdot \cdot \mathrm { O } ( 3 )$ distance of 2.733(4) A (Fig. 1b). The coordinated water molecules and carboxylic oxygen atoms (O(2)) of the adjacent supramolecular chains are linked by the O(3)-H(3D).O(2) (2.687(0) A） hydrogen bonding interactions to construct a 2D supramolecular layer (Fig.1c). It is noteworthy that there are 1D water chains formed by O(4)-H(4D)?O(4) (2.814(3）A） hydrogen bonding interactions. Theexistence of hydrogen-bonding interactions (O(4)-H(4C)..O(2), 2.888(7) A) between carboxylic oxygen atoms (O(2)) of the 2D supramolecular layers and the 1D water chains which further stabilize the whole structure leads to a 3D supramolecular structure (Fig. 1d).

# 3.2Crystal structure of $\mathbf { C u } _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { p c a } ) _ { 2 } ( \mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } ) _ { 4 }$ (2)

The single-crystal X-ray data reveal the asymmetric unit of 2 consists of one ${ \mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ cation,one pca²- anion and two coordination water molecules (Fig. 2a). The ${ \mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ ion is five-coordinated by one oxygen atom (O(1)) and one nitrogen atom (N(1)) from one $\mathrm { p c a } ^ { 2 - }$ anion, one nitrogen atom (N2) from the other pca²- anion and two coordination water molecules (O(3), O(4) to give the $\{ \mathrm { C u O } _ { 3 } \mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \}$ tetragonal pyramidal geometry. The bond distances of $\mathrm { C u - O }$ and $\mathrm { { C u - N } }$ are $1 . 9 6 8 4 ( 1 7 ) { \sim } 2 . 3 6 2 4 ( 1 8 )$ and $1 . 9 5 2 1 ( 1 9 ) { \sim } 1 . 9 6 2 8 ( 1 9 ) \mathrm { ~ \AA }$ ,respectively. The bond angles around $\mathrm { C u ^ { 2 + } }$ ion are in the range of $8 1 . 9 8 ( 7 ) \sim 1 7 2 . 5 2 ( 8 ) ^ { \circ }$ .The $\mathrm { p c a } ^ { 2 - }$ anion adopts the monodentate-chelating coordination mode connecting $\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + }$ ions to generate the dinuclear structure, in which two pyrazole rings from the adjacent $\mathrm { p c a } ^ { 2 - }$ anion are parallel with a dihedral angle of $0 ^ { \circ }$ ，and the distance of $\mathrm { { C u } \cdots \mathrm { { C u } } }$ is $3 . 9 0 6 0 \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ . Four pyrazole nitrogen atoms and two $\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + }$ ions almost locate in a plane and construct a six-membered ring.The dinuclear structures are further connected to form a 1D supramolecular chain by the O-H…O hydrogen bonding interactions，which occur between the oxygen atoms (O(3)） from coordination water molecules and the carboxyl oxygen atoms (O(1)) from $\mathrm { p c a } ^ { 2 - }$ anions with the distance of 2.720(2) $\mathring \mathbf { A }$ (Fig. 2b).The final 3D supramolecular architecture is formed through O(4)-H(8)..O(3), O(3)-H(6).·O(2) and O(4)-H(7)..O(2) hydrogen bonding interactions between the neighboring 1D supramolecular chains with the distances of 2.729(2), 2.749(2) and 2.736(3) A,respectively (Fig. 2c).

# 3.3 PXRD analysis

The experimental and simulated PXRD paterns of complexes 1 and 2 are shown in Fig.3. Their peak positions were in good agreement with each other,indicating the phase purity of complexes 1 and 2.

# 3.4Thermal stability analysis

In order to study the thermal stabilities of complexes 1 and 2, their TGA were performed. The TGA curves of complexes 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 4.For 1,the weight loss from room temperature to $1 0 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is $1 9 . 9 8 \%$ (calculated $2 0 . 1 2 \%$ ),which corresponds to the loss of latice water and coordinated water molecules. Then the network began to decompose totally at $4 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,and the residual is CuO.Complex 2 displayed the first weight loss of $1 6 . 6 9 \%$ at the temperature of $9 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (calculated $1 7 . 1 7 \%$ ),which was due to the departure of coordinated water molecules,and then it kept stable until $2 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . When the temperature was above $3 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,the framework collapsed totally.

# 3.5Selective oxidation of alkylbenzenes catalyzed by complexes 1 and 2

The oxidation of $\mathrm { C ^ { - } H }$ bonds of alkylbenzenes,for instance, is a powerful tool to generate high value chemical feedstock from less expensive raw materials such as alkyl aromatics,and great efforts have been made in exploring new catalysts[17]. In this regard,the means to convert benzylic hydrocarbons into valuable compounds have received considerable attention in recent years[18]. Herein，we report the oxidation of alkylbenzenes with TBHP as the oxidant using two copper complexes as catalysts.

To investigate the effectivenessof complexes 1 and 2 in the oxidation of alkylbenzenes,the oxidation of diphenylmethane was first examined as a standard substrate with $70 \%$ TBHP in benzonitrile at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ (Scheme 1). The conversion and selectivity of each reaction were summarized and illustrated in Fig.5.After the preliminary optimization,we noted that complex 2 was active and more selective for the oxidation of diphenylmethane than other catalysts tested.

As the excellnt performance, complex 2 was selected to examine the long-term stability in a heterogeneous system. After completion of the oxidation reaction, the catalyst can easily be separated from the reaction mixture by filtration. The recovered catalyst was re-activated by washing with methanol and further reused directly in the subsequent oxidation reactions.The experiment results displayed that after three runs no obvious loss of activity (Conv. $9 6 . 2 \%$ (1st), $9 6 . 0 \%$ (2nd), $9 5 . 7 \%$ (3rd)) was observed (Fig. 5).The PXRD spectra of 2 collected before and after the catalytic reactions indicated that the structure was maintained under turnover conditions (Fig. 6).

The mild reaction conditions，excellent stability，and high yield for the transformationof diphenylmethane to benzophenone prompted us to extend the scope of 2 as heterogeneous catalyst for other benzylic hydrocarbons. As shown in Table 3,complex 2 exhibits excelent catalytic activity for oxidation of diphenylmethane, 9H-xanthenes, fluorene and derivates of fluorene to the corresponding aryl ketones with up to $9 7 . 6 \%$ yield (Table 3, entries 1-5). By comparison with previous reports, we found that 2 outperformed some heterogeneous catalysts, such as polyoxometalates[19],， MOFs[20] in the oxidation of diphenylmethane, fluorene and 9H-xanthene (Table 3).

# 4 CONCLUSION

In summary, by controlling the reaction conditions, we have synthesized two pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid complexes 1 and 2. The introduction of $\mathrm { C u } ^ { 2 + }$ cations make 1 and 2 more stable and can be used as heterogeneous catalysts in the selective oxidation of alkylbenzenes with high catalytic activities. Specifically, complex 2 can convert alkylbenzenes to corresponding aromatic ketones eficiently and can be reused by filtration without the loss of itsactivity.Investigations on the use of thesecomplexes for other potential catalytic reactions are in progress.

Two new copper complexes based on pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid ligand, $\mathrm { C u ( H p c a ) _ { 2 } ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 2 } } { \cdot } 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ (1), $\mathrm { { C u } _ { 2 } ( p c a ) _ { 2 } ( H _ { 2 } O ) _ { 4 } }$ (2), have been synthesized and further studied as catalyst in the oxidation of alkylbenzenes TBHP as the oxidant. The results showed that they exhibited excellent catalytic performances (Conv. up to $9 8 . 9 \%$ , Sele. up to $9 8 . 7 \%$ ）
