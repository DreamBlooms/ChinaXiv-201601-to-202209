Abstract: From August 25 to 29,2014,the project team carred out the experiment of Antarctic krilltrawl in the Beihai Bayof the South China Sea.In orderto understand the flow field of the network model in the course of the experiment,itis necessary to record the speed of the shipand to grasp the flow field of the ocean.Therefore, the ocean velocity is measured during the experiment. The flow rate in this experiment was measured using an acoustic Doppler flowmeter(Vectrino Plus,Nortek, Norway). In order to compensate for the flow rate error caused by ship drift, the drift condition of the ship was also measured by the positioning device (Snapdragon MSM8274AB, Qualcomm, USA) used in the flow rate measurement.The results show that the actual velocity of the target sea area is in the range of $0 . 0 6 { - } 0 . 4 9 \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ s and the direction is 216.17-351.70. And compared with the previous research, the influencing factors were analyzed.This study proves that it is feasible to use point Doppler flowmeter for velocity study in trawl model experiment.

# 1.1 Flow rate measurement

The flow rate in this experiment was measured using an acoustic Doppler flowmeter(Vectrino Plus,Nortek, Norway) with a system sound of $1 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ and an accuracy of $\pm 0 . 5 \%$ of the measured value, belonging to a high-precision three-dimensional instrument. It uses the principle of acoustic Doppler measurement to measure the flow rate with the Doppler shift of the acoustic wave in the flow field.The main components of the device 4-arm flat-panel sensor installed in the $4 0 \mathrm { c m }$ long rod-type fixed fixed probe probe,there are four focus beam, the probe

size is small greatly reducing their impact on the flow field.No moving parts, no friction and hysteresis, measurement of induction time fast, you can $2 0 0 \mathrm { H z }$ sampling rate to measure the flow field velocity. The measurement data is read by the software (Vectrino $+ 1 . 1 4$ ,Nortek),which monitors and records the change in flow rate over time.

In the measurement, the probe of the flowmeter is fixed at $2 \mathrm { m }$ below the water level of the ship side.The X axis is aligned with the direction of the bow, the $Z$ axis is perpendicular and the Y axis is perpendicular to the X axis and the direction is perpendicularto the ship's side.Flow rate measurement data acquisition interface and data output as shown in Figure 1,a total of 2O,from the data can be read in the sensor measurement data correlation coefficient were 98,97,97,96,in general screening correlation coefficient greater than 70 Data,this groupof data quality is good.X,Y,Z in the directionof the flow rate were -0.147,-0.026,0.O11. Data analysis,flow rate size, direction calculation and other basic statistical analysis and steady-state,corelation,spectrum analysis and other analysis in the flow rate analysis software (ExploreV Pro 1.58, Nortek AS,Norway).

According to the ocean hydrological observation GB, the flow rate measurement time is $3 \mathrm { m i n }$ . The flow velocity in the experimentis basedon the velocity in the three directions.According to the distribution of he flow direction in the whole measurement process,the direction of the flow velocity is the most instantaneous velocity direction,asshown inFig.2,when the flow velocitydirection is -151°.The directionof the direction of the bow is O, the vertical ship is $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ outward, the stern direction is $1 8 0 ^ { \circ }$ ,and the vertical ship's side is $- 9 0 ^ { \circ }$

# 1.2 Experimental ship motion measurement

According to the provisions of the National Standard Ocean Survey (Part 2: Ocean Hydrological Observations (GB/T12763.2-2O07) (hereinafter referred to as the national standard for marine hydrology observation),the ship needs to be anchored when measuring the ocean flow velocity,but this test Conditions can not be related to he restrictions.Inorder to compensate fortheflow rate eror causedbyshipdrift,the drift condition of the ship was also measured by the positioning device (Snapdragon MSM8274AB, Qualcomm, USA) used in the flow rate measurement.The output of the positioning data is the NMEAO183 standard format developed by the National Ocean Electronics Association.It is a string of ASCI codes.Each setof data has two kinds of statements.GPGGA, GPRMC, for example, a set of data is as follows:

$\$ 5$ GPGGA,15334,1954.2826,N10930.4979,E,1,27,3,-10 M,0000 \* 3A $\$ 5$ GPRMC,15334,A,1954.2826 N,10930.4979,E,0.6,292.7,290814, \*02

It can be seen that the location of the positioning equipment is single point positioning,the number of satelites is 27,the horizontal accuracy factor is 3, the experimental ship drift movement rate is $0 . 6 \mathrm { k n }$ , the direction of motion is 292.7, the relevant data in the ocean data view application software ODV 4.5.6,AWI, German), the trajectoryof the experimental ship drift is shown inFig.2. Generaly speaking,the drift of the experimental ship can be considered as a uniform motion,and the whole of the drift trajectory can be obtained Drift displacement of the ship during flow measurement. Combined with the time of the whole processto obtain the speed of the ship drift.

# 1.3 actual ocean velocity calculation

The actual velocity of the ship is superimposed on the velocity of the ship and the actual ocean velocity is obtained.According to the ocean hydrological observation of the national standard,continuous observation of the current at least once per hour observation.In order to maintain the consistencyof the experimental conditions in the whole group of experiments,the flow rate measurement is carried out before the start of each experiment,and the actual ocean velocity is obtained as the ocean velocity in the experiment.

For the experimental waters and roughly the same time,2006-2Oo7 Xiamen University, China Ocean University, South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, South China Sea Institute of Ocean through 9O8 special (908-01-ST09) had Qiongzhou Strait west of the acoustic Doppler(ADCP,Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers) measured the flow rate[1l,its position as shown in Figure 4 M3,and the experimental area is similar.

The site's velocity profile began on July 23,2O06,and finally on August 24 of August.The observed results show that the flow field of the site is stronger in August (Figure 3).During the period from 3 August to 21 August, the M3 was basically eastward, with the exception of August 5,10,11 and 14.In the August 21 to24,M3 and turn to the west to the flow, which 21 and 24,the entire vertical water are west,but 22 and 23 of the West flow mainly in the upper $7 \mathrm { m }$ of water.

4.2Abrief analysis of the influencing factors

In general,there are three factors,such as tidal and Qiongzhou Strait, which are afected by the velocity of the experimental sea.According to Li Shuhua et al.l2],the numerical simulation of the North Bay tidal wave system is carried out. The experimental waters may be normal tide Tidal opposite,for the irregular day trend; Qiongzhou Strait on the northern Gulf of water supply flux and vorticity of the northern part of the northern part of the circulation also plays a keyrole; the other in the northeastern part ofthe northern partof the circulation and the monsoon higher corrlation ,There are significant seasonal changes in the characteristics of the North Bay is mainly controlled by the East Asian monsoon system,summer for the southwest wind,and winter for the northeast wind.
