# ABSTRACT

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of nanoparticle dispersion on surface morphological changes and degradation process in polymeric coatings during exposure to ultraviolet(UV) radiation.Three types of nano-titanium dioxide(nano $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ ）were selected and dispersed into acrylic urethane (AU) coating to generate degrees of nanoparticle dispersion states.Two accelerated exposure conditions:wet ( $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ and $7 5 \%$ relative humidity(RH))and dry( $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ and $0 \%$ RH),were selected. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was used to monitor surface chemical degradation.Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was used to characterize nanoparticle dispersion and surface/subsurface morphological changes in the AU coatings during UV exposure.For a given nanoparticle,similar surface morphological changes of the coatings indicated the similardegradation processes under the wet and dry conditions,but the degradation was faster under the wet condition.Surface morphological changes were closely related to the nanoparticle dispersion in three coatings,and the heterogeneity in nanoparticle dispersion significantly affects the degradation process and dominates the degradation patterns.

# 1.Introduction

In recent years,nanoparticles have been added to polymer matrices to enhance their mechanical and appearance properties in automotive,aerospace,infrastructure,and manufacturing applications [1-3]. It is well-known that the surface properties of polymeric systems differ greatly from their bulk properties and that the surface is the first target in any degradation process initiated by ultraviolet (UV）radiation，mechanical stress (via scratch and abrasion),temperature,and/or moisture[4,5].Surface damage causes changes in optical and morphological properties, suchas gloss loss,yellowing,chalkingand cracking,which significantly affect the long-term performance of these complex materials.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of surface and subsurface heterogeneity in nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ filled polymeric coatings on the surface degradation process under the exposure of

UV radiation and moisture.A nano-titanium dioxide $\mathrm { ( T i O _ { 2 } ) }$ filled acrylic urethane (AU) coating was chosen due to its wide use.Three types of commercial nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ were selected for this study to generate different degrees of filler dispersion and microstructural heterogeneity.

$\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ isa photoreactive material,with level of photoreactivity dependent on the crystal type,size,and surface treatment. Preferably,aseriesofnano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ particles with the same size,crystal formand photoreactivity,but different surface functionality would be the best to generate different dispersion state.However,it is difficult to obtain commercial nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ particles of similar crystal size,form and photoreactivity.In this study, three types of nano$\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ with similar crystal size but varying levels of photoreactivity were selected:ananatase form,a rutile form,and amixed crystal form of anatase and rutile.According to the reported studies [6-12],an anatase form is generally more photo-active thana rutile form,and a mixed crystal form of them possesses a higher photoreactivity thanananatase form due to a possible synergetic effect. In this study,itis highly expected that the varyinglevels of photoreactivity of the nanoparticlesmay have varying effects on the photodegradation of the coatings.And with photodegradation progressing，the dispersion effect of nanoparticles on polymer degradation process could be displayed.

Some studies have been carried out to investigate the efect of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ on the photodegradation of polymeric composites [13-17]. Clerici et al. [13] investigated the effect of pigmentary $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ dispersion on the durability of epoxy coatings.Dispersant was employed toprepare“well dispersed”and“poorly dispersed" specimens.They found that difference in dispersion state played a significant role in polymer degradation.Wang et al.[14] investigated the effect of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ pigment type in terms of surface treatment, particle size and dispersion on the photodegradation of filled coatings.In their study,nanosize $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ with high photoreactivity and micron size $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ with low photoreactivitywere used.It was found that both particle dispersion and photoreactivity had a significant effect on the degradation of the polymeric coatings.However,in their study,two exposure conditions selected were an ambient,dry condition $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $0 \%$ relative humidity (RH)] and a hightemperature,wet condition( $. 5 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $7 5 \%$ RH),where the effect of humidity and temperature on photodegradation were not separated.Moreover,nanosize and micron size $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ were used, instead of onlya series of nanosize or micro size $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ .Based on the previous study[17],compared to micro size $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ ,the nanosize $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ shows higher photoreactivity due to its much larger surface area. Also,the dispersion of nanosize $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ in coatings is expected to be different compared to that of its micron size counterpart.In this study,a seriesof nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ were selected to study the effect of nanoparticle dispersion on the degradation process of polymeric coatings,which has not thoroughlyunderstood so far.

The objective of the present work was to study the effect of heterogeneityinnano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ dispersion on the UV-initiated surface degradation process in three nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ filled AU coatings with moisture.Two accelerated exposure experiments:wet ( $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ and $7 5 \%$ relative humidity(RH)) and dry ( $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ and $0 \%$ RH),were carried out using the NIST SPHERE(Simulated Photodegradation via High Energy Radiant Exposure） [18,19].Laser scanning confocal microscopy（LSCM）was used to characterize the nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ dispersion and monitor the surface and subsurface morphological changes in the polymeric coatings during UV exposure.Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATRFTIR）was used to monitor surface chemical degradation.To quantify the degradation rate, the changes in the peak intensity of some IR bands as a function of UV exposure time were calculated.It was found that nanoparticle dispersion dominated the surface morphological changes during UV radiation and significantly affected the degradation process of the filled coatings.

# 2.1.Materials and sample preparation

lThe three commercial nano $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ used in this study are designated as $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ 0 $\mathsf { P _ { B } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ The crystal type,average crystal size,surface treatment,and relative photostability[11] of these materials are listedin Table1.

The preparation of nano $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ /AU films isas follows:(1）Nanoparticles were added slowly into acrylic resin (Joncryl 588,BASF) and stirred using a high speed mechanical mixer (Dispermat - BYK Gardner) at $5 2 . 4 ~ \mathrm { { r a d } } / s$ for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ; followed by continuous mixing at $3 6 6 . 5 \ r a { \bf d } / s$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ；(2) isocyanate(DesmdurN32oo,Bayer) was added to the mixture at a 65/35 acrylic/isocyanate mass ratio and mixed at $3 6 6 . 5 ~ \mathrm { r a d } / s$ for anadditional $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ; (3) the mixture was degassed for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ in a vacuum oven;(4) the mixture was applied to release paperusinga drawdown technique;(5) film samples were cured at room temperature overnight,and then post-cured at $1 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The thickness of dry film was approximately $1 1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ measured by micrometer. The same loading of particle volume concentration (PVC） was kept constant of $5 \%$ for all samples.

Table 1 Nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ particles were labeled as $\mathrm { { P } _ { A } , \mathrm { { P } _ { B } , } }$ and $\mathrm { P _ { C } }$ Crystal type,average crystal size, and surface treatment were provided by manufacturers.The relative photostability was measured by a spin trap method using electric paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements [11].A higher value represented a higher photostability and thereby a lower photoreactivity level.

# 2.2.UV exposure experiments

Film specimens were mounted in a sample holder and exposed using an advanced accelerated UV weathering chamber, the NIST SPHERE [18,19].The SPHERE generates high intensity UV radiation and allows accelerated photodegradation of exposed specimens to be carried out. The SPHERE is equipped with environmental chambers in which temperature,humidity,and UV spectral irradiance can be individually controlled.In this study, two exposure conditions were selected:a wet condition ( $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ and $7 5 \%$ RH)and a drycondition ( $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $0 \%$ RH).Surface chemical and morphological changes in the nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ filled coatings were characterized atsequential intervalsusing ATR-FTIR and LSCM.

# 2.3.Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR)

ATR-FTIR analysis was performed using a Nexus 67O(Thermo Nicolet) with an MCT detector and an ATR accessory with a diamond crystal (Durascope). Each specimen was sampled at three different locations,and 128 spectra with $4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ resolution were collected at each location.A background scan was collected before each new sample.A custom software package was used to normalize,baseline correctand analyze the data.Note that the ATR results are strongly affected by the surface roughness of the overall contact area.

# 2.4.Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM)

A Zeiss model LSM510 reflection laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM）was employed to characterize nanoparticle dispersion and the surface/subsurface morphology in AU coatings. A detailed description of LSCM can be found in the literature [20,21].The laser wavelength was $5 4 3 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and imageswere taken at amagnification of $1 5 0 \times$ ,withoptical slice( $z$ -step)of $0 . 1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ for AU coatings containing $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ or $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { B } }$ and $0 . 2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ containing $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ To eliminate the strong reflection from polymer surface,an oil lens withamagnificationof $1 0 0 \times$ and a numerical aperture of1.3O was used to image the particle dispersion inside the coatings.LSCM graphs shown here were two dimensional (2D) projection images in xy plane and in xz plane,and a single frame depth - profile image in xyplane ataz-depth of $3 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ 2D(xy) projection image in the xy plane (512 pixel $\times 5 1 2$ pixel) was formed by summing the stacks of the image in the $z$ direction of the coatings,while the 2D (xz) side projection image was projected in lateral xz plane in the $y$ direction.The depth- profile wasa single layer selected from the stack of the image,which displayed the microstructure and nanoparticle agglomerate distribution in the subsurface of polymeric coatings.Pixel intensity level represented the total amount of backscattered light.Lighter areas represented regions that scatter more light than darker areas.

The morphology change of AU coatings under UV exposure was also characterized using LSCM equipped with a custom-designed stage to reproducibly image the same location in the specimen each time.In this way,morphology evolution at the same location can be monitored asa function of exposure time.The root mean square (RMS)[14] surface roughness, $R _ { \mathfrak { q } }$ ,was calculated to quantify the morphology changes in surface and subsurface of coatings during the UV exposure. Eqs.(1) and (2) were used to calculate $R _ { \mathfrak { q } }$ fromthe 3D topographical images:

$$
R _ { \mathrm { q } } = \sqrt { \frac { 1 } { N _ { x } \cdot N _ { y } } \cdot \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N _ { x } } \cdot \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { N _ { y } } \cdot { [ z ( x _ { i } , y _ { i } ) - R _ { \mathrm { c } } ] } ^ { 2 } }
$$

$$
R _ { c } = \frac { 1 } { N _ { x } \cdot N _ { y } } \cdot \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N _ { x } } \cdot \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { N _ { y } } \cdot z ( x _ { i } , y _ { i } )
$$

where $N _ { x }$ and $N _ { y }$ are the number of pixels in the $\mathbf { X - }$ or $y$ -direction. An automatic plane fit along with a numerical filter $( 3 \times 3 )$ was used in this case.The $R _ { \mathfrak { q } }$ values presented here were the averaged RMS surface roughness values obtained at 4 measurements from eachscannedareaof $5 6 . 1 \mu \mathrm { m } \times 5 6 . 1 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .The error bar represented the standard deviation froma mean value.

# 3.Results and discussion

# 3.1.Nanoparticledispersion andheterogeneousmicrostructure

Fig.1 displays 2D (xy and xz） LScM projections and depthprofile images at $3 . 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ below polymer surface for all AU nano$\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ coatings.Since the refractive index of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ particlesishigher than that of the polymer matrix,the bright spots represent $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanoparticles on or near the surface while dark regions are associated with the polymer matrix.The backscattered intensity ofa particle agglomerate depends strongly on the size of agglomerate ${ \bar { ( I \propto \mathsf { s i z e } } ^ { 6 } ) }$ and the packing of the nanoparticles in the agglomerate. Larger agglomerates appear much brighter than the smaller ones.

The 2D (xy) projection images (Fig.1a) of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ and $\mathsf { A U - P _ { B } }$ showed small bright spots uniformly distributed.However,there were very few bright spotson the surface of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ This implies that most of $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } } \mathtt { T i O } _ { 2 }$ particles were buried deep into the polymer matrix.This observation is confirmed by the 2D $( \mathbf { x } z )$ side projection images (Fig.1b). For $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ ，the particles were distributed uniformlyand tightlypacked near the surface.However,for AU- $\cdot \mathrm { P } _ { \mathsf { C } } ,$ the particle agglomerates were loosely packed and the Z-depth was larger. Z-depth,defined as the total scanning or laser penetration depth in the $z$ direction(shown in Fig.1b）was around $8 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ for $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } } , 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ for $\mathsf { A U - P _ { B } }$ and $2 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ for $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ Tomore closely investigate the nanoparticle dispersion (particle shape and size) inside the film,depth profiling was carried out at $3 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ below the polymer surface,as shown in Fig.1c. $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ agglomerates were smaller than $5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and uniformly distributed in the AU coating,most of the $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ agglomerates were spherical in shape and had diameters as large as $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and $\mathsf { P _ { B } }$ agglomerates were elliptical and randomly distributed throughout the AU coating with sizes intermediate between $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ agglomerates.

Fig.2.Illustration of laser penetration in coatings (a) with small and densely packed particles,and (b)with large and a fewer particles.Z indicated laser penetration depth. The green boxes showed the clear layer regions in both cases.(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Asmentioned above,the Z depth is larger in $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ than in $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ (asshown in Fig.1b),and the result can be illustrated in Fig.2,which is more comprehensible.Fig.2a illustrates a smaller penetration depth in coatings containing densely packed,small particles(similar to $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } } )$ ,while Fig.2b shows a larger penetration depth with fewer,larger particles (similar to $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P c } )$ Because the smaller $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ agglomerates were uniformly distributed and densely packed near the surface layers,they scattered most of the incident laser light near the surface,preventing the laser from penetrating deeper;consequently,Z depth was smaller for coatings formulated with $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ In comparison,fewer and larger $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ agglomerates were buried deep inside the films.Less lightwas scattered near the polymer surface,while instead,it penetrated deeper and was reflected back by larger particle agglomerates,and thereby,Zdepth was larger.

It was observed that most of the large $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ particle agglomerates sank to the bottom of the wet coating after the drawdown application and were buried deep inside the cured film.This resulted ina much thicker clear layer for coatings formulated with $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ than with $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ and $\mathsf { P _ { B } }$ (asillustratedin Fig.2b).A clearlayer was defined as a layer of unpigmented (or pigment-poor） medium formed at the surface of a pigmented coating [22].As the $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ or $\mathsf { P _ { B } }$ particle agglomerateswere distributed densely on the surface and subsurface layers,the clearlayer wasquite thin;in comparison, the clear layer was much thicker for coatings formulated with $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ Clericietal.[13]also observed the clear layerin their study,and a thinner clear layer was formed in the“well dispersed"specimen, while a thicker one in the“poorly dispersed"specimen.

To achieve a better dispersion measurement,a high numerical aperture oil lens with index match oils was used to eliminate the light scattered from polymer surface.Fig.3a shows 2DLSCM images of AU coatings containing $\mathrm { { P } _ { A } , \mathrm { { P } _ { B } , } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ ,respectively,obtained using an oil lens( ${ \bf \langle 1 0 0 \times } / 1 . 3 0 )$ .Clearly,the distribution of $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ in AU was more uniform than that of $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { B } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ ,and the agglomerate sizes of $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ were larger than those of $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { B } }$ Toquantify the size distribution of agglomerates,the freeware ImageJ[23] was used to process image threshold and analyze agglomerate size.Fig.3b displays the corresponding threshold images of the 2D LSCMimagesin Fig.3a.The size distributions of $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ $\mathsf { P _ { B } }$ $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ agglomeratesare listed in Table 2.Noticeably, the majority ofagglomerate size was ${ \leq } 0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (atresolution limit at this magnification) in all three cases. However, $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ agglomerates had a narrower size distribution than that of $\mathsf { P _ { B } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ agglomerates.The degree of dispersion,DoD,(or polydispersity index) can be calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm { D o D } = { \frac { d _ { \mathrm { w } } } { d _ { \mathrm { n } } } }
$$

where $d _ { \mathrm { n } } = \left( \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } n _ { i } \cdot d _ { i } \right) / \left( \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } n _ { i } \right)$ and $\begin{array} { r } { d _ { \mathrm { w } } = \left( \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } { n _ { i } \cdot d _ { i } ^ { 2 } } \right) \bigg / } \end{array}$ $\left( \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } { n _ { i } \cdot d _ { i } } \right)$ are the number and weight averaged agglomerate sizes, respectively.The values of $d _ { \mathrm { n } } , d _ { \mathrm { w } }$ and DoD for each of the AU systems are listed in Table 3. $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ had the lowest DoD of 1.12,followed by $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { B } }$ with a DoD of 1.27,and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ with the highest of 1.98.Asa lower DoD corresponds to better dispersion,the best AU nanoparticle dispersion among the three types of nanoparticles was found in the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ coating,while the worst was in the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating. Visual heterogeneity in terms of particle size and distribution was also the most obvious in the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating.Itis claimed that the nanoparticles used in this study were in the states as they were commercially supplied, without any further surface modification to adjust the dispersion. Thereby, the various nanoparticle dispersion states presented in this study were what they were formed.

The confocal image obtained using an oil lens is consistent with that obtained using regular lens.However, the oil lens method is a contact measurement and provides no information on surface morphology. For the purpose of monitoring surface/subsurface degradation,the LSCM images presented laterin this paper were generated using $1 5 0 \times / 0 . 9 5$ regular lens.As discussed above, different degrees of nanoparticle dispersion were obtained with the different type of nano $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ .The heterogeneity in microstructure and dispersion was expected to impact the surface degradation of polymeric coatingsunder UV exposure.Thereby, the remainder of the paper will focus on the effect of nanoparticle dispersion on morphological changes in AU coatings under wet and dry conditions with UV exposure.

# 3.2.UV exposure under wet condition

Fig.4 shows the surface morphology changes initiated by UV exposure under the wet condition for the three nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ filled AU coatings.The images were obtained at the same location on each sample.For the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ coating,a network-like degradation pattern was observed on the surface around week 2.It appeared that the polymer degraded around the uniformly distributed $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ agglomerates,and then the eroded areas connected,forming a network-like pattern.Gradually, the network-like pattern became coarser as the degradation progressed.And the darker regions,corresponding to the eroded sections,became larger and larger.In comparison, the surface morphology of the unfilled AU coating (not shown here) exhibited no significant changes after a 6- week period of UV exposure,and no distinguishable surface features were formed. This result implies that the incorporation of $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ nanoparticles in AU coatings affected the surface morphology change during UV exposure.However，for the AU - $\mathsf { P _ { B } }$ coating，no significant morphology changes were observed during the 6 - week UV exposure.For the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating,uniform erosion of the clear layer was the first step of degradation on polymer surface,and then some degradation featuresappeared.The size of these features increased and some of them merged and increased in size after week 4.It was observed that once after the clear layer was eroded and the nanoparticles appeared onto polymer surface,the polymer surface degradation was not a uniform process any more.The polymer degradation kept progressing in the polymer-rich regions (or the nanoparticle-poor regions),while severe degradation was found in the vicinity of large particle agglomerates originally buried deep inside the films.Thereby,after the nanoparticles appeared onto polymer surface,the polymer degradation process became quite inhomogeneous for $\mathsf { A U \mathrm { ~ - ~ } P _ { C } }$ coating due to its ununiformed nanoparticle dispersion.

By comparison of the polymer degradation in Fig.4,dramatic difference of surface morphological changes was observed between $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ $( \mathrm { D o D } = 1 . 1 2 ) \$ and $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { B } }$ $( \mathrm { D o D } = 1 . 1 7 ,$ ),whichwasmuch more obvious than that of the dispersion of the two samples.It is probably attributed to the higher photoreactivity of $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ .For photoreactive $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ ，when it absorbs UV radiation,free electrons are promoted from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving positively charged holes in the valence band.Both the electrons and the holes are capable of participating in photooxidation and therebyaccelerate degradation of polymeric materials [1O,14]. It is shown in Table 1 that the photoreactivity of the three nanoparticles is ranked as $P _ { \mathrm { { A } } } > > P _ { \mathrm { { C } } } > P _ { \mathrm { { B } } }$ 、Consequently,photodegradation was faster for $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ relative to $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ and $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { B } }$ A parallel experiment without UV radiation under wet condition ( $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ $7 5 \%$ RH) was carried out on the coatings containing photoreactive fillers of $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ (not shown here).No significant surface morphological changes were observed up to 12 weeks.Similar result was also reported in our previous work carried out at NISTabout EVA systems,and no visible chemical or morphological changes were observed for specimens exposed to condition without UV radiation [24]. It implies that UV radiation Was the primary factor in initiating the polymer degradation,relative to photoreactivity of the nanoparticles and humidity. As prominent photodegradation was observed in AU coatings containing $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ and $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ rather than ${ \mathrm { P } } _ { \mathrm { B } } ,$ it indicates that the photocatalytic effectof the nanoparticles played a prodegradant role during the photodegradation of the polymers, consistent with the previous literature [25].

Other than the effect of photoreactivity, Fig.4 also demonstrates the effect of the nanoparticle dispersion on the degradation of the AU coatings.As it was described earlier in this section,uniform network-like degradation patterns were observed for $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } } ,$ （20 while inhomogeneous degradation for $\mathsf { A U } \mathrm { ~ - ~ } \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } } ,$ with severer degradation occurring surrounding particle agglomerates than in the bulk matrix without fillers.The different surface morphological changes were closely related to the dispersion of photoreactive nanoparticles in the polymeric coatings.It hasalready been discussed that the nanoparticle dispersion in ${ \sf A U } - { \sf P c }$ coating was very poor,with big agglomerates and small ones distributing in the matrix.As the interfacial area around a big nanoparticle agglomerate was larger thana small one,the polymer degradationwas thereby much more prominent. Consequently， thephotodegradation for the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P c }$ coating was quite inhomogeneous. Moreover, the degradationof AU-Pc seemed slower for the first 4 weeks,and after the nanoparticles appeared on the polymer surface,its degradation seemed to have speeded up.Itis believed that the thicker clear layer in $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ was the possible cause for the slower surface degradation before week 4(Fig.2b).The polymer photodegradation might not be accelerated by the photocatalytic effect of the nanoparticles until they were exposed onto surface by erosion of the clear layer. To summarize,nanoparticle dispersion wasa significant factor contributing to the different degradation patterns between $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ and $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ system had the worst nanoparticle dispersion $( \mathrm { D o D } = 1 . 9 8 \$ ),andprovidedwith exposure to UV radiation,it definitely displayed prominent localized degradationaround the large nanoparticle clusters,which was consistent with the reported study[14].The result implies that the effect of nanoparticle dispersion plays a significant role in the degradation process.

# 3.3.UV exposure under dry condition

The morphology change of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ and $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ during UV exposure under the dry condition is shown in Fig.5.For both samples,the patterns of morphological changes under the dry condition appeared to be similar to those observed under the wet condition,but the degradation was much slower.For example,the localized degradation around large nanoparticle agglomerates in the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating became visible around week12 under the dry condition,compared to week 4 under the wet condition. It implies that surface degradation was accelerated at higher humidity at a certain temperature.Previous literatures have interpreted that under UV radiation,photoexcited $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ would produce electrons and positive holes,which would react with water and oxygen (existing in the experimental conditions) to form OH·.The hydroxyl radical would attack polymeric materials,resulting in accelerated polymer photodegradation[17,26,27]. Other studies also reported that water could be absorbed in coatings [28],higher humidity accelerated photodegradation of polymer films [24,29] and that prolonged exposure to moisture promoted more severe degradation in polymer coatings [3o].In summary, the moisture/humidity playsa role in accelerating the photodegradation of polymer coatings containing high photoreactive nanoparticles under UV radiation.

# 3.4.Rate of UV degradation

One of the methods to quantify UV degradation rate is to measure chemical changes in the degraded polymers,e.g.using data obtained from ATR-FTIR measurements as a function of exposure time[21,31,32].In this study,changes in two infrared (IR) bands were monitored: the decrease in ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathrm { - } } { \mathsf { H } }$ stretch band $( 2 9 3 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } .$ ） attributed to mass loss of the polymer,and the increase of the carbonyl $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { C } } = 0$ stretch band ( $\cdot 1 7 2 4 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } .$ ),attributed to oxidation of the polymer matrix.The relative change in the intensity of the ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathrm { - } } { \mathsf { H } }$ stretch band at exposure time $t$ was normalized by the absorbance of the band at $2 9 3 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ in the unexposed specimen (at exposure time $t = 0$ ).Eq. (4) was used to calculate the relative change:

![](images/bc40be8e4d9f29cd24947ecdfb89829b99617f1539a40f9c7cd45eaa79ee0b0d.jpg)  
Fig.5.2D LSCM images of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ and $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ at different exposure times under the dry condition.The scale bar was $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ Each image sizewas 5 $\mathsf { 6 . 1 ~ \mu m } \times 5 6 . 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$

$$
{ \mathfrak { O } } 2 9 3 3 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 } = 1 0 0 ^ { * } \left( { \frac { A _ { t , 2 9 3 3 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 } } } { A _ { 0 , 2 9 3 3 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 } } } } - 1 \right)
$$

where $A _ { 0 , 2 9 3 3 }$ and $A _ { \mathfrak { t } , 2 9 3 3 }$ are the IR absorbance values at $2 9 3 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for each specimen at O and t weeks of UV exposure.Formation of oxidation products was measured by the relative change in $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { C } } = 0$ stretch absorbance.The relative change in the $1 7 2 4 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - \bar { 1 } }$ band was calculated by normalization to the IR absorbance at $2 9 3 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and the difference from the ratio of the unexposed specimen as shown in Eq. (5):

where A0,2933,At,2933,Ao,1724,and $A _ { \mathrm { t } , 1 7 2 4 }$ are the IR absorbance values at $2 9 3 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and $1 7 2 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ determined for each specimen at O and t weeks of UV exposure.

Fig.6displays the relative changes in the absorbance of IRbands at(6a) $2 9 3 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and (6b) $1 7 2 4 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ under the wet condition,and (6c) $2 9 3 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and (6d) $1 7 2 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ under the dry condition. The relative loss in intensity of $2 9 3 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was larger than $80 \%$ for AU$\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ and AU- $\cdot \mathrm { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ systems at week 4under the wet conditionand larger than $60 \%$ at week 8 under the dry condition.It indicates that the mass loss was accelerated under the wet condition,consistent with the surface morphological changes.However, the uncertainty increased and the measurements became unreliable with long exposure times due to the severe increase in surface roughness.The relative intensity change for $1 7 2 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was increased under both wetand dry conditions,and the increase wasa little bit faster for the former than the latter condition at the early stage.In comparison, the change in the $1 7 2 4 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ band was surprising lower, with an increase around $2 0 \ \% - 3 0 \ \%$ as compared to $80 \%$ loss in the relative changes observed in $2 9 3 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ band.It probably indicates that part of the polymers was oxidized and major part was degraded under UV exposure.

Overall,in terms of relative changes in IR absorbance bands, $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ had the largest degradation rate in the earlier stages of degradation,followed by $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } } ,$ （204 $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { B } }$ and unfilled AU,as illustrated in Fig.6a and b.Note that the unfilled AU did degrade under UV exposure.However,as its degradation was probably a homogeneous reduction in thickness, no significant surface morphological changes were observed within the experimental range,which might be the same phenomenon as the degradation in the clear layer.A previous study[21] indicates that mass loss corresponding to the changes in the ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathrm { - } } { \mathsf { H } }$ stretch band at $2 9 3 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ is only correlated to the film thickness changes in the early stage of the degradation process,during which coating surfaces remain relatively smooth.When the surface pits or protuberances grow larger,theuncertainties in the IRdataalso increase.Therefore,ATRFTIR results cannot truly reflect the surface chemical degradation for the samples undergone a long-term UV exposure.Non-contact IR techniques such as photoacoustic IR spectroscopy will be utilized for further studies.

# 3.5.Degradationprocessaffectedbynanoparticledispersion

ATR-FTIR turns out to be only feasible to study the early-stage degradation process fornanoparticle filled coatings,while LSCM is usually applied to investigate the morphological changes during a long-term degradation process as the measurements are noncontact and non-invasive.LSCM images provide detailed information on surface degradation,and can be used to monitor the surface morphological changes and surface roughness during UV exposure. Fig.7a displays theaverage RMS roughnessvaluesasa function of UV exposure time for the unfilled AU and three filled AU coatings under the wet condition.The unexposed (week 0) $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating showed the largest surface roughness value,followed by $\mathsf { A U - P _ { B } } ,$ （204号 then $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ and finally unfilled AU,in the same sequence as the nanoparticle dispersion heterogeneity.During UV degradation, roughness of the unfilled AU and $\mathsf { A U - P _ { B } }$ coatings did not change significantly,as no noticeable surface featureswere formed in these two coatings.In comparison, for $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ ,asharp increase in RMS roughness was observed between week1and week2,which was related to the network-like structure formation (Fig.4,left column).

For $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } } ,$ little change in roughness was observed before week 2 due to the lack of topographical changes during the erosion of the clear layer.Roughness began to increase at around week3,which arose from the appearance of localized degradation features (Fig.4, right column).The degradation features grew much larger after week 5 for $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating,and the corresponding RMS roughness value increased sharply as well,eventually surpassing that of AU - $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ coating.

As discussed previously, similar morphological changes were observed under the wet and dry conditions for AU coatings containing the same nanoparticle.Fig.7b displays RMS data for $\mathsf { A U - P _ { A } }$ and $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ as a function of exposure time under both conditions. For better comparison,all curves were normalized to the initial roughness value of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ under the wet condition $( \mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P c } -$ wet)at time zero.The roughness of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ and $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ under the wet condition increased much faster compared to their counterparts under the dry condition.To understand the correlation between the surface roughness and nanoparticle dispersion in the degraded coatings,the degradation process can be divided into three stages,similaras dividing it into three regions reported in the literature studying the relation between film thickness changesand chemical changes during UV degradation [21].For example,for AU $- \mathsf { P _ { A } }$ under the wet condition (indicated as dashed lines in Fig.7a), no significant changes in roughness were observed in the first stage (before $t _ { 1 }$ ):thisisdueto theerosion of the thin clearlayer.In the second stage (between $t _ { 1 }$ and $t _ { 2 , }$ ),roughnessincreaseddramatically due to the development of a network-like structure formed during polymer degradation around particle agglomerates.In the third stage (after $t _ { 2 } \mathrm { . }$ ),theroughness increased slowly,probablydue to a very slight change in topographical structure.It might be related to the shielding effect of the densely and uniformly distributed $\mathsf { P _ { A } }$ nanoparticles on the surface.For latex 一 $\mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating under the wet condition (indicated as dotted lines in Fig.7a),the RMS roughness curve can also be divided into three stages.In the first stage (before $t _ { 1 } ^ { \prime } { \overset { \cdot } { , } }$ ,no obvious changes were observed,due to the erosion of the thicker clear layer.In the second stage (between $t _ { 1 } ^ { \prime }$ and $t _ { 2 } ^ { \prime }$ )，the roughness increased slowly,due to the formation of some pits around the particle clusters.In the third stage (after $t _ { 2 } ^ { \prime } \dot { . }$ )，the roughness increased dramatically,due to growing and merging of the pits and the severe degradation around the large particle clusters.

Noticeably, the time frame for stage1was longerin $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ than in $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ underboththewet and dryconditions,due toathicker clear layer observed in the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating. For $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating under both wet and dry conditions,the slopes of the roughness curves increased much faster after the nanoparticle agglomerates appeared on polymer surface,as the severe localized degradation around large particle agglomerates contributed to the dramatic increase in surface roughness.However, the slopes of the roughness curves of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coatings did not reach the third stage of the $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ within the experimental range.It might be due to the different degradation processes in the two coatings,as evidenced by the different degradation patterns.The degradation of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ coating was a very inhomogeneous process,attributed from the severe localized degradationaround the poorly-dispersed particle agglomerates combined with slower degradation in unfilled polymer matrix.Whereas,the degradation of $\mathsf { A U } - \mathsf { P } _ { \mathsf { A } }$ coating wasprogressing around many uniformly distributed small agglomerates.Note that RMS data were obtained from averages of many large areas and the RMS surface roughness curve was closely correlated with the surface morphological changes.In summary, the surface roughness changes were not only well-correlated with the surface morphological changes,but more importantly, theyalso reflected the nanoparticle dispersion in the coatings.

# 4. Concluding remarks

In this study,the effect of heterogeneity of nanoparticle dispersion on the surface photodegradation was studied for the nano- $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ filled AU coatings under both wet and dry conditions exposed with UV radiation. It was found that UV radiation is the primary and the most important factor in initiatingphotodegradation.Photoreactivity(or photocatalytic effect） of nanoparticles and humidity/moisture are as significant factorsas prodegradants in accelerating photodegradation.The dispersion of photoreactive nanoparticles dominates the surface photodegradation patternsand thereby significantlyaffects the degradation process of the polymer coatings.

Without UV radiation, nano $\cdot \mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ could not be photoexcited,and no chain scission would occur in polymer coatings,and thereby, photooxidation and photodegradation could not happen.Without higher relative humidity (moisture),the photodegradation would beslower,as fewer high reactive radicals would be formed to initiate the polymer degradation.Without higher photoreactive nanoparticles,the degradationwould also be slower,as photostable $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ could notbe photoexcited byUV radiation to participate in the subsequent photooxidation.Provided with the aforementioned factors (UV radiation,moisture，photoreactivity)，the effect of nanoparticle dispersion on degradation process could be demonstrated during the photodegradation.Based on the results in this study, the heterogeneity of the nanoparticle dispersion plays a significant role in affecting the degradation process and dominating the surface morphological evolution.
