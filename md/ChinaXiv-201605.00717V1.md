Cyclic GMP-AMPsynthase (cGAS)sensescytosolicDNAduringviralinfectionandcatalyzes synthesisof thedinucleotidecGAMP, whichactivates theadaptorSTINGto initiateantiviralresponses.Herewefound thatdeficiencyinthecarboxypeptidase CCP5 or CCP6 led to susceptibilitytoDNA viruses.CCP5and CCP6 were required foractivationof the transcription factor IRF3 andinterferons.PolyglutamylationofcGASbytheenzymeTTLL6impededitsDNA-bindingabilitywhereasTTLL4-mediated monoglutamylationofcGASblockeditssynthaseactivity.Conversely,CCP6removedthepolyglutamylationofcGAS,whereas CCP5 hydrolyzedthemonoglutamylationofcGAS,whichtogetherled totheactivationofGAS.Therefore,glutamylationand deglutamylation of cGAS tightly modulate immune responses to infection with DNA viruses.

The innate immune system uses pattern-recognition receptors to detect microbial signatures (microbe-associated molecular patterns) or cellular damage (damage-associated molecular patterns)1,2.Given that nucleic acids are central to the replication and propagation of pathogens,the recognition of aberrant RNA and DNA serves as a fundamental mechanism of host defense'.The activation of cytosolic nucleic acid receptors initiates the production of type Iinterferons and other cytokines and leads to the activation of adaptive immunity and restriction of infection4-6.

Several DNA sensors,including Sox2 (ref.7),TLR9 (ref.8), AIM2 (ref.9),DAI10,IFI16 (ref.11)and DDX41 (ref.12),have been reported to monitor pathogenic DNA that induces the secretion of type Iinterferons and proinflammatory cytokines.The cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase cGAS has been defined as a key sensor of cytosolic DNA13-15. After binding DNA,cGAS catalyzes the synthesis ofcGAMP,which in turnassociateswithandactivates the adaptor STING and then elicits innate immune responses1,16,17. However, it is still unknown how the activity of cGAS is regulated during host defense.

Post-translational modifications of proteins,such as phosphorylation,acetylation,ubiquitination and glycosylation,have important roles in regulating the activity of the target proteins during immune responses18,19. Glutamylation adds glutamate side chains onto the $\gamma \cdot$ carboxyl groups of glutamic acid residues in the sequence of target proteins20,21. Glutamylation is catalyzed by glutamylases,such as TTLL ('tubulin tyrosine ligase-like'） enzymes22,23. Glutamylation is a reversible modification akin to phosphorylation,whereby glutamates can be removed bya family of cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs)21.Polyglutamylation of tubulins,the wellknown targets of glutamylation,modulates the interaction between microtubules and their partners,which regulates microtubulerelated processes such as ciliary motility and neurite outgrowth21,24. Glutamylation of the spindle-checkpoint protein Mad2 has a pivotal role in the development of megakaryocytes25.Here we identified differential glutamylation of cGAS that regulated its activity in antiviral defense.

# RESULTS Susceptibility of CCP5-or CCP6-deficient mice to DNA viruses

Mice deficient in the gene encoding the cytosolic carboxypeptidase CCP6 (Agbl4; calld 'Ccp6' here) display underdevelopment of megakaryocytes and abnormal thrombocytosis25.We therefore sought to explorewhether glutamylationwas involved in the regulation of host defense against viral infection.In addition to mouse strains deficient in CCP1 (Agtpbpl;called‘CcpI'here) and Ccp6 studied before25, we generated mouse strains deficient in the genes encoding CCP2 (Agbl2; called‘Ccp2' here),CCP3 (Agbl3; called ‘Ccp3' here), CCP4(Agbl1;called Ccp4'here) or CCP5(Agbl5;called‘Ccp5'here) via genome-editing approached based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats(CRISPR)and the endonuclease Cas9(Supplementary Fig.la) and further verified deletion of these genes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Fig.la).We infected all six mutant mouse strains withDNAviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and vaccinia virus (VACV).We noted that mice deficient in Ccp5 $( C c p 5 ^ { - / - } )$ or Ccp6( $C c p 6 ^ { - / - } )$ were more vulnerable to HSV and VACA infection than were the other mutant mice (Fig.1b and SupplementaryFig.1b).Moreover, $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ mice had lower concentrations of type Iinterferons in serum than did their wild type littermates,after infection with HSV (Fig.1c,d).In contrast, mice deficient in Ccp1,Ccp2,Ccp3 or Ccp4 had concentrations of

typeIinterferons in serum similar to those of their wild-type littermates after infection with HSV(Fig.le,f).Consistent with that,after infection with HSV,viral titers were much higher in Ccp5-or Ccp6- deficient mouse brains than in their wild-type counterparts (Fig.lg). At the same time,after infection with HSV,viral titers in mice deficient in Ccp1,Ccp2,Ccp3 or Ccp4 were similar to those of their wild-type counterparts (Supplementary Fig.lc).Similar results were obtained by infection with VACV (Supplementary Fig.1d-f).

We then assessed interferon-encoding mRNA in Ccp5- or Ccp6 deficient cells of the innate immune system following viral infection. As expected,after infection with HSV,Ccp5-or Ccp6-deficient cells had much lower expression of Ifnb mRNA (encoding interferon- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \beta }$ (IFN- $\cdot \{ \beta \} ,$ ) than did their wild-type counterparts after infection with HSV(Fig.1h-j).In contrast,cells of the innate immune system from mice deficient in Ccp1,Ccp2,Ccp3 or Ccp4 had expression of Ifnb mRNA similar to that of their wild-type counterparts after infection with HSV (Supplementary Fig.lg-i). Similar observations were obtained with VACV-infected Ccp5-or Ccp6-deficient cells (data not shown).These results indicated involvement of CCP5 and CCP6 in regulating immune responses to DNAviruses.

# Requirement for CCP5 and CCP6 in Ifnb induction

We next sought to assess the innate immune responses of BMDMs to viral challenge by analyzing the activation of the transcription factor IRF3,which undergoes homodimerization after it is phosphorylated26.We observed that Ccp5-or Ccp6-deficient BMDMs failed to trigger activation (homodimerization) of IRF3 or production of IFN- $\beta$ following infection with a DNA virus (Fig.2a).However, afterchallenge with an RNA virus,Ccp5-or Ccp6-deficient BMDMs were able to induce IRF3 activation and IFN- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \beta }$ secretion (Fig. 2a). Consistent with that,transfection of herring testis DNA or Escherichia coli DNA did not induce activation of IRF3 in or secretion of IFN- $\beta$ from Ccp5- or Ccp6-deficient BMDMs (Supplementary Fig.2a). As expected,the synthetic RNA duplex poly(I:C) triggered IRF3 activation and IFN- $\beta$ production in $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs (Supplementary Fig.2a).These data confirmed the proposal that CCP5 and CCP6 were specifically involved in the regulation of immune responses to DNA viruses but not those to RNA viruses.

To determine whether the enzymatic activity of CCP5 and CCP6 was required for the activation of IRF3,we generated enzymatically inactive mutants of CCP5(CCP5-mut; with the substitutions H252S and $\mathrm { E } 2 5 5 \mathrm { Q } ) ^ { 2 1 }$ and CCP6(CCP6-mut; with the substitutions H230S and $\mathrm { E } 2 3 3 \mathrm { Q } ) ^ { 2 5 }$ .We then restored expression of CCP5 in $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs via wild-type CCP5 or CCP5-mut.We found that restoration with CCP5-mut resulted in no activation ofIRF3 after infection with HSV,whereas wild-type CCP5 triggered IRF3 activation (Fig.2b). In parallel,restoration of the expression of CCP6 in $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs via CCP6-mut resulted in no activation of IRF3 after infection with HSV (Supplementary Fig.2b).Consequently, similar restoration via CCP5-mut or CCP6-mut did not induce Ifnb expression after challenge with HSV,whereas similar restoration with wild-type CCP5 or wild-type CCP6 did initiate elevated expression of Ifnb after challenge with HSV (Fig.2c).Restoration via CCP5-mut and CCP6-mut did not eradicate HSV infection(Fig.2d,e and Supplementary Fig.2c). Tofurther define the direct effectof CCP5 and CCP6 on IRF3 activation and interferon production,we overexpressed CCP5 or CCP6 in wild-type BMDMs.As expected,overexpression of CCP5 or CCP6 augmented IRF3 activation and IFN- $\beta$ expression after challenge with HSV(Fig. $^ { 2 \mathbf { f } , \mathbf { g } }$ ),and promoted restriction of HSV propagation (Supplementary Fig.2d).These results indicated that the deglutamylation hydrolysis activity of CCP5 and CCP6 was required for the induction of IRF3 activation and IFN- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \beta }$ production during infection with a DNA virus.

$\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ is an agonist for carboxypeptidases²7,and phenanthroline serves as an inhibitor of carboxypeptidases²1.We noted that after infection with HSV,treatment with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ substantially enhanced IRF3 activation in wild-type BMDMs,whereas such IRF3 activation was abrogated in $\displaystyle C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ cells infected with HSV and treated with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ (Fig.2h).Conversely, treatment with phenanthroline hindered the activation of IRF3 in wild-type BMDMs (Fig.2i).Consequently,after challenge with HSV, treatment with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ increased Ifnb expression and antiviral activity in wild-type BMDMs but not in $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs (Fig.2j,k and Supplementary Fig.2e,f).In contrast, treatment with phenanthroline decreased Ifnb expression and antiviral activity in wild-type BMDMs but not in $\displaystyle C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs (Fig. 2j,k and Supplementary Fig.2e,f). In addition, treatment with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ or phenanthroline did not affect Ifnb expressionafter infection of wild-type BMDMs or even $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs with vesicular stomatits virus (Supplementary Fig.2g).This confirmed the proposal that CCP5- or CCP6-mediated deglutamylation participated in the regulation of antiviral responses to DNA viruses.

# cGAS asa substrate for CCP5 and CCP6

We next sought to identify candidate substrates for deglutamylation during antiviral responses to DNA viruses.The antibody GT335 specifically recognizes the branch points of glutamate side chains and detects all glutamylated forms of target proteins21.After immunoblot analysis,two bands of around 58 kilodaltons (kDa)and $5 0 \mathrm { k D a }$ appeared in the lanes for lysates of BMDMs and dendritic cells (DCs) from CCP5-deficient mice (Fig.3a).The upper band ( $\langle 5 8 \mathrm { \ k D a } \rangle$ was undetectable and the lower band $( 5 0 \mathrm { k D a } )$ had diminished intensity in the corresponding lanes for lysates of BMDMs and DCs from their wild-type littermates (Fig.3a).Thus,these two bands might have represented proteins that could be potential substrates for CCP5.We next generated wild-type CCP5 and CCP5-mut and immobilized them on affinity resin for neutral or basic proteins,for passage through BMDM lysates by affinitychromatography.The eluted fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE,followed by silver staining(Fig.3b).These two bands were present in the gel analyzing CCP5-mut and were cut for mass spectrometry. The lower, 50-kDa band was identified as $\alpha$ -tubulin (data not shown),a reported CCP5 substrate21.The upper, 58-kDa band was identified as cGAS (Supplementary Fig.3a),a previously unknowncandidate substratefor CCP5.

CCP5-mut was able to precipitate cGAS from BMDMlysates (Fig.3c) Colocalization ofcGAS with CCP5 in the cytoplasmof BMDMs was visualized byconfocal microscopy(Fig.3d).Moreover, the colocalization ofcGAS with CCP5 did not overlay with microtubular structures (Fig.3d).Staining of cGAS displayed punctate structures (Fig.3d), as previously observed15.Moreover, the CCP inhibitor phenanthroline augmented the association between CCP5 and cGAS,whereas treatment with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ abrogated this association (Fig.3e).Notably, deletion of CCP5's enzymatic domain (residues 160-424) abolished the interaction between CCP5 and cGAS (Supplementary Fig.3b), which suggested that the interaction of CCP5 with cGAS required the enzymatic activity of CCP5.As noted for CCP5,the interaction of CCP6 with cGAS was also verified (Fig.3f and Supplementary Fig. 3c,d).The interaction of CCP6 with cGAS was also dependent on its enzymatic activity(Supplementary Fig.3e).Collectively,these results indicated that the associationof cGAS with CCP5 or CCP6 required the enzymatic activity of CCP5 or CCP6,which suggested that cGAS might bea potential substrate for CCP5 and CCP6.

Notably,recombinant CCP5-mut or CCP6-mut did not precipitate together with recombinant cGAS (data not shown),whereas CCP5-mut or CCP6-mut bound to endogenous cGAS (Fig.3c,f).These results suggested that CCP5 or CCP6 might need to bind to glutamylated cGAS for their hydrolysis.Indeed,cGAS was glutamylated in BMDMs (Fig.3g).Moreover, treatment with the CCP inhibitor phenanthroline substantially enhanced the glutamylation of cGAS, whereas the CCP agonist $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ rendered the glutamylation ofcGAS undetectable (Fig.3g).More notably,more glutamylation of cGAS was observed in $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ and $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs than in wild-type cells (Fig.3h).In contrast,overexpression of CCP5 or CCP6 decreased the glutamylation of cGAS (Fig.3i).Additionally, CCP1, CCP2, CCP3 and CCP4 failed to precipitate togetherwith cGAS in BMDMlysates (data not shown).Finally,deficiency in Ccp1,Ccp2,Ccp3 or Ccp4 did notaffect the glutamylation ofcGAS (data not shown).Therefore,in these conditions,cGAS was a substrate for both CCP5 and CCP6 but not for other CCPs.

# Deglutamylation of cGAS by CCP5 and CCP6

Glutamylationis the ATP-dependent addition of glutamates catalyzed by glutamylases of the TTLL family, either singly or sequentially20. As noted above,the antibody GT335 can recognize branch-point glutamates,while the polyglutamylation-specific antibody polyE is able to detect three or more consecutive branched glutamates21. On the basis of amino acid mapping and structural prediction of cGAS,we identified two putative glutamylation site on mouse cGAS (Supplementary Fig.3f-h).We then substituted alanine for the glutamic acid at positions 272 (E272A) and 302 (E302A),separately or together,and transfected vector encoding these mutants into BMDMs.We found that cGAS(E272A) had branched glutamates that were detected onlyby GT335,whereas cGAS(E302A) had branched glutamates that were detected by both GT335 and polyE (Fig.3j). Moreover, the double mutantcGAS(E272A,E302A) lacked branched glutamates (Fig.3j).These results suggested that cGAS had three or more glutamates added at Glu272 and two or fewer glutamates at Glu302.

We next investigated how cGAS was deglutamylated by CCP5 and CCP6.We cotransfected BMDMs with vector encoding cGAS(E272A) orcGAS(E302A),together with vector encoding CCP5 or CCP6, and assessed the cells by immunoblot analysis.We observed that overexpression of CCP5 abolished the GT335 signals for BMDMs transfected to express cGAS(E272A) but not in those transfected to express cGAS(E302A)(Supplementary Fig.4a).In contrast, overexpression of CCP6 eliminated the GT335 signals for BMDMs transfected to express cGAS(E302A） but not those transfected to express cGAS(E272A）(Supplementary Fig.4b).Moreover, Ccp5-deficient BMDMs overexpressing cGAS(E272A) displayed stronger GT335 signals than those in similarly transfected wild-type cells,whereas overexpression of cGAS(E302A) had no such effect (SupplementaryFig.4c).Inaddition,overexpression of cGAS(E302A) in Ccp6-deficient cells resulted in stronger GT335 and polyE signals than those of similarly transfected wild-type cells,while overexpression of cGAS(E272A) did not influence GT335 signals of immunoprecipitated cGAS (SupplementaryFig.4d).As expected,CCP5-mut associated with cGAS(E272A) but not with cGAS(E302A) in lysates of wild-type BMDMs transfected to express these (Supplementary Fig.4e).In contrast,CCP6-mut interacted with cGAS(E302A) but not withcGAS(E272A) in lysates of wild-type BMDMs transfected to express these (SupplementaryFig.4f).Therefore,CCP5 was responsible for hydrolyzing the glutamate chain of cGAS at E302,and CCP6 removed the glutamate chain ofcGAS at Glu272.

# Differential glutamylation of cGAS byTTLL4 and TTLL6

To further determine how the glutamylases catalyzed the glutamylation of cGAS,we screened nine glutamylases for their interactions withcGAS.We found thatonly TTLL4 and TTLL6 associated with

cGAS (Fig.4a).Furthermore,TTLL4 and TTLL6 showed high constitutive expression in cells of the mouse innate immune system, such as BMDMs,DCs and fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig.4g). The interaction of cGAS with TTLL4 and TTLL6 was verified by a precipitationassay(Fig.4b,c).cGAS localized togetherwith TTLL4 and TTLL6 in the cytoplasm of BMDMs,and this colocalization did not overlay with microtubular structures (Fig.4d,e).These observations suggested that TTLL4- and TTLL6-mediated modifications of cGAS were not restricted to microtubular structures.It has been reported that TTLL4 is a monoglutamylase and that TTLL6 polyglutamates tubulins²3.After incubation with TTLL4 in an invitro glutamylation system,GT335 (glutamate) signals appeared (by immunoblot analysis）only for samples containing wild-type cGAS or cGAS(E272A)，not those containing cGAS(E302A) (Fig.4f),which suggested that cGAS was monoglutamylated by TTLL4 at $\mathrm { G l u } 3 0 2$ In contrast,following incubation with TTLL6,both GT335 and polyE signals were present (by immunoblot analysis) for samples containing wild-type cGAS or cGAS(E302A) but not those containingcGAS(E272A) (Fig.4g),which indicated that cGAS was polyglutamylatedby TTLL6 atGlu272.

Through domain mapping,we found that TTLL4 interacted with a fragment consisting of residues 280-320 of cGAS,whereas TTLL6 associated with a fragment consisting of residues 240-280 of cGAS (Supplementary Fig.4h).Additionally, TTLL4 and TTLL6 associated with wild-type cGAS or either cGAS mutant (Supplementary Fig.4i,j),which suggested that the interaction of cGAS with TTLL4 and TTLL6 was independent of the glutamylation of cGAS.We next generated Ttll4- orTtll6-deficient mice via CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Supplementary Fig.4k).We noted that the GT335 signals for immunoprecipitated cGAS were substantiallydiminished in $T t l l { 4 ^ { - / - } }$ BMDMs,whereas polyE signals were unchanged, relative to those in wild-type cells,as detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig.4h).In contrast,polyE signals forimmunoprecipitated cGAS were undetectable and GT335 signals were substantially diminished in $T t l l { \epsilon } ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs, relative to those in wild-type cells,as detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig.4i).Finally,restoration of $T t l l { 4 } ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs with cGAS(E272A)

did not result in GT335 signals,whereas $T t l l { 4 } ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs restored with cGAS(E302A) displayed GT335 signals,as detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig.4j).In parallel,restoration of Ttll6-/-BMDMs with cGAS(E272A) resulted in GT335 signals of cGAS but a lack of polyE signals,whereas restoration of Ttll6-/-BMDMs with cGAS(E302A) impaired both GT335 signals and polyE signals of cGAS,as detected byimmunoblot analysis (Fig.4k).cGAS was therefore glutamylated differentially by TTLL4 and TTLL6.

# cGAS polyglutamylation suppresses its DNA-bindingability

Afterbinding DNA,cGAS undergoes aconformational change to catalyze cGAMP synthesis28,29.To investigate whether glutamylation of cGAS affected its DNA-binding ability,we performed a DNA-precipitation assayusing cell lysates pretreated with the CCP agonist $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ or the inhibitor phenanthroline.After treatment with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ ,more cGAS associated with double-stranded DNA(dsDNA) (Fig.5a).In contrast,after treatment with phenanthroline,less cGAS was precipitated by dsDNA (Fig.5a).To further analyze the DNA-binding ability of cGAS in vivo,we transfected dsDNA into BMDMs,followed by incubation of the cells with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ or phenanthroline.Consistent with the results reported above,in the presence of phenanthroline,cGAS associated with less dsDNAin BMDMs,whereas it bound much more dsDNA in the presence of $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ (Fig.5b).These results suggested that glutamylation of cGAS impeded its DNA-binding ability.

We next sought to determine which glutamic acid's glutamylation affected the DNA-bindingability of cGAS.We transfected dsDNA,

along with vector encoding wild-type cGAS or either of the two cGAS mutants,into BMDMs for precipitation assays.More cGAS(E272A) than wild-type cGAS bound dsDNA,whereas cGAS(E302A) and wildtype cGAS bound dsDNA to a similar degree (Fig.5c).These data suggested that glutamylation ofGlu272 hindered the binding of DNA to cGAS.Additionally, cGAS did not bind dsDNA in $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs (Fig.5d,e).However,similar amounts of cGAS bound dsDNA in $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ and wild-type BMDMs (Fig.5d and Supplementary Fig.5a). Accordingly,cGAS(E302A) overexpressed in $C C P 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs failed to bind dsDNA(Fig.5f),whereas cGAS(E272A) overexpressed in

$C C P 5 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs bound the same amount of dsDNA as in $C C P 5 ^ { + / + }$ cells (Supplementary Fig.5b). The polyglutamylation of cGAS at Glu272,therefore,suppressed its DNA-binding ability.

Given that TTLL6 catalyzed the polyglutamylation of cGAS at Glu272, we used $T t l l { 6 } ^ { - / - }$ cells to further investigate the dsDNA-binding ability mediated by the polyglutamylation ofcGAS.We noted that more cGAS was able to bind dsDNA in $T t l l { \epsilon } ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs than in wild-type cells,whereas similar amounts of cGAS were precipitated by dsDNA in $T t l l { 4 ^ { - / - } }$ BMDMs and wild-type cells (Fig.5g).Consistent with that,overexpression of cGAS(E302A) in $T t l l { 6 } ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs enhanced its DNA-binding ability,as did overexpression of cGAS(E272A), whereas overexpression of cGAS(E302A) in $\mathbf { \nabla } T t l l 6 ^ { + / + }$ BMDMs did not affect its DNA-binding affinity (Fig.5h). However, Ttll4 deficiency did not affect the DNA-binding ability of cGAS (Supplementary Fig.5c).Finally,cGAS(E272A) pre-incubated with TTLL6 in vitro was precipitated by dsDNA as efficiently as recombinant wildtype cGAS was,but wild-type cGAS and cGAS(E302A)lost their DNA-binding ability after incubation with TTLL6 in vitro (Fig.5i,j). In contrast, incubation with TTLL4 did not alter the DNA-binding ability of cGAS(E272A) orcGAS(E302A) (Supplementary Fig.5d). These results indicated that the TTLL6-mediated polyglutamylation of cGAS at Glu272 abolished its DNA-binding ability.

As a consequence of the results reported above, $T t l l { 6 } ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs exhibited higher expression of Ifnb mRNA than thatof $\scriptstyle { T t l l 6 ^ { + / + } }$ cells afterinfection with HSV (Fig.5k).Moreover, Ttll6 deficiency substantially suppressed the propagation of HSV (Supplementary Fig.5e). We then generated BMDMs deficient in the gene encoding cGAS (Mb21dl; called‘Cgas' here) viaa CRISPR-Cas9 approach,as reported7, and restored cGAS expression via wild-type cGAS or cGAS(E272A) in these $C g a s ^ { - / - }$ cells.We found that restoration with cGAS(E272A) accelerated interferon expression relative to its expression afterrestoration with wild-type cGAS and consequently suppressed viral amplification (SupplementaryFig.5f,g).Therefore,TTLL6-mediated polyglutamylation ofcGAS at Glu272 inhibited its DNA-binding ability, which led to suppression of its activity against viral infection.

# Blockade of cGAS synthase activity via monoglutamylation

We further explored how the synthase activity of cGAS was regulated byits glutamylation.We observed,by thin-layerchromatography(TLC),that treatment with $\mathrm { C o C l } _ { 2 }$ substantially enhanced the formation of cGAMP catalyzed by cGAS (Fig.6a).Conversely, treatment with phenanthroline abrogated the synthesis ofcGAMP (Fig.6a),which suggested that glutamylation of cGAS participated in the negative regulation of its enzymatic activity.cGAS(E3o2A) pro moted much more formation of cGAMP than did wild-type cGAS (Fig.6b),which suggested that monoglutamylation of cGAS at Glu302 inhibited its synthase activity.

We observed that CCP5 removed the monoglutamylation of cGAS at Glu302 (Supplementary Fig.4c).As expected, Ccp5 deficiency disrupted the synthase activity of cGAS (Fig.6c).We also found that the monoglutamylation of cGAS at Glu302 was catalyzed by TTLL4 (Fig.4f).Therefore,Ttll4 deficiency resulted in significantly augmented cGAMP synthesis (Fig.6d).In addition,cGAS(E302A) still displayed cGAMP-synthetic activityafter incubation with TTLL4 in vitro,whereas wild-type cGAS lost its cGAMP-synthetic ability after incubation with TTLL4(Fig.6e).These data indicated that monoglutamylation of cGAS at Glu302 catalyzed by TTLL4 impeded the synthase activity of cGAS forcGAMP synthesis.

As expected, $T t l l { 4 ^ { - / - } }$ BMDMs displayed higher expression of Ifnb mRNA than that of $T t l l 4 ^ { + / + }$ cells after infection with HSV (Fig. 6f). Consequently, Ttll4 deficiency substantially suppressed the propagation ofHSV (Fig.6g).We then restored cGAS expression via wild-type cGAS or cGAS(E302A) in Cgas-deficient BMDMs.We found that restoration with cGAS(E302A） promoted Ifnb expression and consequently restricted viral propagation (Fig.6h,i).Thus,TTLL4- mediated monoglutamylation of cGAS at Glu302 blocked its synthase activity,which resulted in suppression of its antiviral activity.

Modulation of antiviral immunity via cGAS glutamylation states To further confirm the proposal of a role for glutamylation and deglutamylation in innate immune responses to DNA viruses, we generated $C c p 5 ^ { - / - } C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ double-deficient mice by crossing $\displaystyle C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ mice with $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ mice and found that the $C c p 5 ^ { - / - } C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ mice lacked expression of CCP5 and CCP6 (Fig.7a).As expected, $C c p 5 ^ { - / - } C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs showed augmented glutamylation of cGAS relative to that of $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ cells (Fig.7b,c). Consequently, $C c p 5 ^ { - / - } C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ mice had a blockade in the production of IFN- $\cdot \beta$ (Fig.7d) and were highly susceptible to infection with HSV(Fig.7e), whereas $C c p 5 ^ { - / - }$ or $C c p 6 ^ { - / - }$ mice produced some IFN $\cdot \beta$ (Fig. 7d) but had compromised resistance to infection with HSV (Fig.7e).These data indicated that CCP5-and CCP6-mediated deglutamylation of cGAS enhanced the production of type I interferons and eradication of DNA viruses.

We also established $T t l l 4 ^ { - / - } T t l l 6 ^ { - / - }$ double-deficient mice by crossing $T t l l { 4 ^ { - / - } }$ mice with $T t l l { 6 } ^ { - / - }$ mice and found that $T t l l { 4 ^ { - / - } } T t l l { 6 ^ { - / - } }$ mice lacked expression of TTLL4 and TTLL6 (Fig.7f).We observed that $T t l l 4 ^ { - / - } T t l l 6 ^ { - / - }$ BMDMs lacked glutamylation of cGAS,whereas $T t l l { 4 ^ { - / - } }$ or $T t l l { 6 } ^ { - / - }$ cells exhibited some glutamylation of cGAS (Fig. ${ \bf 7 9 , h } _ { . } ^ { \cdot }$ ).Moreover,T $t l l 4 ^ { - / - } T t l l 6 ^ { - / - }$ mice produced greater amounts of IFN- $\beta$ than did $T t l l { 4 ^ { - / - } }$ or $T t l l { 6 } ^ { - / - }$ mice (Fig.7i) and were much more resistant to infection with HSV than were $T t l l { 4 ^ { - } } ^ { + }$ or $T t l l { 6 } ^ { - / - }$ mice(Fig.7j).Thus,TTLL4-and TTLL6-mediated glutamylation of cGAS suppressed the production of type Iinterferons and clearance of DNA viruses.Glutamylation and deglutamylation of cGAS, therefore,tightly regulated the immune response during infection with DNA viruses.

# DISCUSSION

cGAS is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase family that catalyzes the synthesis of cGAMP from GTP and ATP in the presence of dsDNAi5,30. In the resting state, the catalytic regions of cGAS are embedded inside cGAS,which hinders the catalytic generation of cGAMP from ATP and GTP16,31,32. Once bound to DNA,cGAS undergoes a conformational change that renders the catalytic pocket of cGAS accessible for cGAMP synthesis28,29,33.Collectively, suchstudies suggest that engagement ofDNA is a prerequisite for activation of the nucleotidyltransferase activity of cGAS.Here we found that the activity of cGAS was tightly regulated by glutamylation and deglutamylation,which had a critical role in the modulation of innate immune responses.

Post-translational modifications act as regulatory signals for control of the stability,localization,activity and function of proteins20,25,34,35. Glutamylation is a modification that adds monoglutamic or polyglutamic acid residues to target proteins in an ATP-dependent manner20,21,35. Glutamylation is catalyzed by the TTLL family of glutamylases22.Gutamylation was originally identified on tubulins as a dominant tubulin modification in the adult brain of mammals36. Tubulins and nucleosome-assembly proteins are well-known substrates for polyglutamylation21,35.In this study，we found that TTLL4 and TTLL6 glutamylated the previously unknown substrate cGAS differentially.TTLL6-mediated polyglutamylation of cGAS at Glu272 impeded its DNA-bindingability,whereas TTLL4-mediated monoglutamylation of cGAS at $\mathrm { \ G l u { 3 0 2 } }$ blocked its synthase activity. Of note,TTLL glutamylases differ in their‘preferences'for their substrates,as well as for the catalysis of glutamate chains,side-chain initiation or elongation23.Thus,TTLL glutamylases direct their effects to different target substrates.

Glutamylationisareversiblemodification,anddeglutamylationis hydrolyzed by $\mathrm { C C P s ^ { 2 1 , 3 4 , 3 7 } }$ .Members of the CCP family have specific expression profiles in different tissues and are involved in a variety of physiological functions21,38.Members of this family have ‘preferred' enzymatic specificities forhydrolyzing deglutamylation.Among these members,CCP1,CCP4 and CCP6 remove the shortening of penul timate polyglutamate chains of $\alpha$ -tubulin,while CCP5 specifically hydrolyzes the branching site glutamate²1.Our results indicated non-redundant roles for CCP5 and CCP6 in the regulation of cGAS activity.Of note,we observed that the amount of glutamylated cGAS diminished rapidlyafter infection withHSV.Meanwhile,the amount of TTLL4 and TTLL6 protein decreased substantially after infection with HSV,whereas the amount of CCP5 and CCP6 remained unchanged during the process of infection.Moreover,after infection with HSV,cGAS associated with larger amounts of CCPs but smaller amounts of TTLL glutamylases.These observations suggested that the activity of cGAS was tightly regulated by its dynamic glutamylation and deglutamylation modifications during infection with HsV.

cGAS detects cytosolic DNA in a sequence-independent manner, which elicits the cGAS-STING pathway to prime innate immune responses to various DNA viruses,retroviruses and even bacterial pathogens39-41. Manipulating the glutamylation state of cGAS could thus potentially either initiate the cGAS-STING pathway to eradicate DNA viruses or shut down this pathway to prevent excessive immune responses.Together our findings have shown that the glutamylation and deglutamylation ofcGAS regulated its activity and, asa consequence,controlled the response to DNA viruses.Therefore, manipulation of the glutamylation state of cGAS might be of clinical importance.

Cells and culture.BMDMs were generated as described below.Bone marrow cells aspirated from mouse femurswere cultured for7d in RPMI-1640 medium containing $1 0 \%$ FBS and $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ macrophage colony-stimulating factor.For macrophage transfection,BMDMs $( 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } )$ were resuspended in $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ Nucleofector Solution buffer (Lonza) containing $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ DNA or other substrates,followed by transfection using the Nucleofector Program Y-001 on Amaxa nucleofector II device (Lonza).Cells were recovered for $6 \mathrm { h }$ in RPMI1640 medium containing $4 \mathrm { m M } \mathrm { n }$ -glutamine, $1 . 5 \mathrm { g } / 1$ sodium bicarbonate and $1 0 \%$ heat-inactivated FBS,followed sorting of viable cells by flow cytometry. To exclude the possible effects of transfected DNAs on subsequent experiments,plasmids transfected cells were further cultured for $4 8 \mathrm { h }$ to allow stable exogenous gene expression for further examination as described30.Cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.

Animals and viruses.Mouse experiments complied with ethical regulations and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at theInstitute of Biophysics,Chinese Academy of Sciences.Ccp1- or Ccp6-deficient mice were described previously25.Ccp2-,Ccp3-,Ccp4-,Ccp5-,Ttl4- or Ttll6-deficient mouse strains were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 approaches as described42.Vesicular stomatits virus and VACV virus strains were gifts from J.Bennink (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases). The viral strain HSV-1f was a gift from H.Peng(Institute of Biophysics,Chinese Academy of Sciences).For preparation of virus,viruses were incubated with Vero cells,followed by supernatant collection $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ later. Supernatants were ultra-centrifuged at 25, $0 0 0 g$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ .Pellets were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium.For virus infection in vivo,mice were given intravenous injection of virus or were inoculated intranasally with virus.Viruses were injected intravenously into mice for determination of viral load in brain.

Plasmid construction and protein purification.cDNA was cloned from a bone marrowcDNA library7.cDNA encoding CCP5,CCP6,TTLL4or TTLL6 was subcloned to pFlag-CMV2(Sigma-Aldrich) or pcDNA4/TO/myc-His B (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells.Protein mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis method as previously described25.cDNAs encoding CCPs and TTLL glutamylases were subcloned into a modified pGEX-6P-1 vector(GE Healthcare）with a carboxy-terminal six-histidine tag.Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). DE3 clones were cultured (absorbance at $6 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m } , 0 . 6 \$ ),followed by induction with $0 . 2 \mathrm { m M }$ IPTG at $1 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ .Cells were collected and lysed through the use of an ultrasonic cell disruptor followed by successive purification through Ni-NTA resins and GST resins.

Immunoprecipitation assay. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, $5 0 \mathrm { m M }$ Tris-Cl, $1 \%$ TritonX-1o0 and protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.4.Lysates were centrifugated on ${ 1 5 , 0 0 0 g }$ for $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ and supernatants were incubated for $6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the appropriate antibodies (identified above),followed by immunoprecipitation with $2 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ protein A/G-conjugated agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Precipitates were completely washed with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE,followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblot analysis.

Immunofluorescence Immunostaining was performed as described previously43.Cells were plated on $0 . 0 1 \%$ poly-L-lysine treated coverslips and fixed with $4 \%$ PFA for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ,followed bypermeabilization with $0 . 5 \%$ Triton X-100 for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at room temperature.Primary antibodies (identified above）were added for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,followed by further staining with Alexa Fluor 488-or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (identified above). Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy(Olympus FV1000).

AlphaScreen.Purified cGAS variants and biotinylated DNA were incubated at various concentrations according to the manufacturer's instructions (AlphaScreen;PerkinElmer).

DNA-precipitation assay DNA-precipitation assays were performed as previously described44.dsDNA was synthesized with an $\mathrm { N H } _ { 2 }$ modification at the $5 ^ { \prime }$ end and the two complementary sequences were annealed,followed by coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resins (GE Healthcare).For the DNA-precipitation assay,recombinant proteins or celllysates were incubated with DNA-linked resins in the presence of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (Calbiochem),followed by washing with buffer containing $1 5 0 \mathrm { m M }$ KCl,and immunoblot analysis (as described above) of precipitates.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation.BMDMs overexpressing Flag-tagged cGAS variants were transfected with dsDNA,followed by crosslinking with $1 \%$ formaldehyde at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .Lysates were incubated with anti-Flag for 6 h after preclearance with salmon sperm DNA-protein Aagarose.Flag-tagged cGAS was then immunoprecipitated by salmon sperm DNA-protein A agarose. Immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially with low-salt wash buffer, highsalt wash buffer,LiCl wash buffer,and TEbuffer,followed by eluting with elution buffer ( $1 \%$ SDS and $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ N a H C O } _ { 3 } ^ { \cdot }$ ).ThecGAS-DNA complexwas reversed by heating at $6 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ DNAwas further purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitated with ethanol,followed by RT-PCR analysis.
