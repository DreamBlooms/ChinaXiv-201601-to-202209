# Abstract

$\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ bulk sample is obtained by hot-pressing under different fabrication parameters,and their thermoelectric properties are investigated in the temperature range of 300-55OK. The highest $Z T { = } 0 . 8 6$ is achieved at 475K for the sample hot-pressed at 423K and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$ due to the lower thermal conductivity and higher power factor. The results indicate that the optimized thermoelectric properties can be obtained for AgSbTez compound at the sintering temperature of 423K under the pressure of ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$

Keywords:AgSbTez; thermoelectric; fabrication parameters;

# 1.INTRODUCTION

Due to their ability to directly convert heat into electricity and vice versa without moving parts or greenhouse emissions,thermoelectric (TE) materials have drawn much attntion in the wake of the energy crisis and the environmental concerns of fossil fuel use.3] The efficiency of a thermoelectric device is quantified by the thermoelectric figure of merit [4.5l, defined as $Z \mathrm { T } = \mathbf { S } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { T } / \rho \mathbf { \kappa }$ , where T, S, $\rho$ （204号 and $\kappa$ are the absolute temperature,the Seebeck coeficient, the electrical resistivity and the thermal conductivity, respectively.A good TE material should possess a high power factor $( \mathsf { S } ^ { 2 } / \rho )$ and low thermal conductivity.

As a $p$ type semiconductor, $\mathrm { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ has a cubic structure with a space group $\mathrm { F m } { - } 3 \mathrm { m } ^ { \ [ 6 , 2 ] }$ as shown in the insert of Fig.1.Because of the complexity of ordering of $\mathrm { A g / S b }$ on the face-centered lattice, the electronic properties of the $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ are quite intriguing and show anomalies[8]. AgSbTe has attracted alotofattention for TEapplications [1.Z,-2],the lower thermal conductivityand higher Seebeck coefficient make the $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ compound a very promising candidate for high efficiency ptype TE applications[8l. Many researches indicate that doping is an effective approach to optimize the thermoelectric properties of p-type $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ by reducing its thermal conductivity and adjusting its carrier concentration Z.8.13-15], while others efforts are focused on improving the TE performance of $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ by nanostructure or nano-compositel1.10.16-23]. In this work, the microstructure of $\mathrm { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ has been adjusted through the control of fabrication parameters (hot pressing temperature and pressure), and we systematically investigate the effect of microstructure on thermoelectric properties of $\mathrm { \mathrm { A g S b T e } } _ { 2 }$ The samples sintered under different fabrication parameters are designated as AST-m-n, where m is the figure of the temperature and n is the figure of the pressure. The results indicate that a peak of $Z \mathrm { T } { = } 0 . 8 6$ at 475K has been obtained by optimizing fabrication parameters for the sample AST-423-500 with sintering temperature $\scriptstyle \mathrm { T = } 4 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ and pressure $\scriptstyle \mathrm { P = 5 0 0 M P a }$ ),as seen in Fig.1.

# 2.EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURE

Polycrystalline $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ compounds are prepared by a fusion method.Elementary silver (99.99wt. $\%$ ),antimony $( 9 9 . 9 9 \mathrm { w t . \% } )$ ） and tellurium $( 9 9 . 9 9 9 \mathrm { w t . \% } \$ powder are weighed accurately to give the desired composition,and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, which are heat-treated in a horizontal furnace at $1 1 7 3 \mathrm { K }$ for 24 hours with the heating rate fixed at $2 \mathrm { K / m i n }$ , then quenched in cool water. The obtained $\mathrm { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ chunks are milled for $2 \mathrm { h }$ by using an agate mortar. The bulk specimens for transport property measurements are obtained by hot-pressing in the vacuum for 1h with different sintering temperature (423K, 473K) and different pressure (150MPa,300MPa, and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { M P a } ) $ ：

The phase structures and the compositions of the obtained samples are checked using x-ray powder diffraction (XRD). XRD analysis is carried out on a Philips diffractometer using $\mathrm { { C u - K a } }$ （20 radiation. The accurate lattice parameters are determined from the $d$ values of the XRD peaks using a standard least-squares refinement method with a Si standard for calibration. The morphology is characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM: Sirion 200).The density $d$ of hot-pressed bulk samples is determined by the Archimedes method and found to be at least $9 5 \%$ of the theoretical density,as listed in the table 1.The resistivity $\rho$ and the Seebeck coefficient $S$ are measured by using a commercially available instrument (ULVAC, ZEM-3) in He atmosphere. Thermal diffusivity (α) is measured by the laser flash method using the Netzsch LFA 457 instrument. The heat capacity $\mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { p } }$ is obtained with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Perkin-Elmer, USA). Thermal conductivity k is calculated based on the relationship of $\kappa { = } \mathrm { { a } } { \cdot } \mathrm { { C } } _ { \mathrm { { p } } } { \cdot } d .$ .The Hall coefficients are measured using the Van der Pauw technique under a magnetic field of $0 . 7 2 \mathrm { T }$

# 3.RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

The morphology and size of the synthesized products $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),as shown in Fig.2(a)-(f),and Fig.2(g) shows that the powder XRD pattern of our polycrystalline sample,all diffraction peaks can be indexed to the phase of $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ (PDF#15-O540), indicating that the obtained specimens have the same crystallographic structure as that of $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ ,The value of the lattice parameters $a { = } 6 . 0 9 1 6 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } \mathrm { m }$ for the obtained powder sample is calculated from the XRD data, which is slightly $( \sim 0 . 1 9 \% )$ larger than the data from the powder diffraction file (PDF#15-0540).Fig.2 (a) and (b) show the low-magnification FESEM image of the samples sintered at $4 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ under a pressure of 150 and $3 0 0 \mathrm { { M P a } }$ , respectively. Fig. 2(a) and (b) reveals that a large number of particles with micron-structures are randomly dispersed with size ranging from about $1 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ to ${ > } { \sim } 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ for the samples sintered at the lower temperature $4 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ ,and that the size of particles is not affected strongly with the pressure. Fig.2(c), (d) and (e) show the lowmagnification FESEM image of the samples sintered at 473K under a pressure of 150MPa,300MPa and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$ , respectively. Fig.2(c), (d) and (e) demonstrate that the samples sintered at temperature of

473K have plate-like structures with a thickness of about $1 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and a length of ${ \sim } 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,which indicates that the smaller particles have grown to plate-like structures at the high sintering temperature, consistent with the increase in the relative density with increasing sintering temperature,as shown in table 1. It can be seen from table 1 that the relative density increases with increasing the sintering pressure and/or temperature, especially, the relative density increases obviously from $9 5 . 3 \%$ to $9 7 . 3 \%$ from $9 6 . 9 \%$ to $9 8 . 5 \%$ ,and from $9 7 . 6 \%$ to $9 8 . 5 \%$ with increasing sintering temperature from $4 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ to 473K for the samples sintered under a pressure of 150, 300 and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$ ,respectively.Fig.2(f) shows high-magnification SEM image of the specimen sintered at 473K and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { M P a }$ ,we can see from Fig.2(f) that the adjacent particles are closely atached to each other,and the sample became much more compact than the samples sintered at 423K.

The thermoelectric properties of $\mathrm { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ are depicted in Fig.3. We can see from Fig.3(a) that the temperature behaviors of the resistivity $\rho ( \mathrm { T } )$ for all the samples are similar: $\rho$ shows weak temperature dependence below about $4 0 0 \mathrm { K }$ and then increases with increasing temperature, finally decreases with further increasing temperature,leaving a peak at a certain temperature. The reduction in $\rho$ at $_ { \mathrm { T } > \sim 4 5 0 \mathrm { K } }$ could be mainly ascribed to thermal excitations of minority carriers[5]. In comparison, p of the $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ samples monotonically decrease with increasing sintering temperature and/or pressure.For instance, at room temperature, $\rho$ of the samples with the same sintering temperature (473K) decrease from $2 . 6 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ to $1 . 4 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ ,and then $1 . 2 0 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \Omega { \cdot } \mathrm { m }$ as sintering pressure increasing from 150 to 300,and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$ ,and $\rho$ of the samples with the same sintering temperature (30oMPa) decrease from $1 . 9 6 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ （204号 to $1 . 4 0 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \Omega { \cdot } \mathrm { m }$ as sintering temperature increasing from $4 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ to 473K.

All the samples have positive values of $S$ ，which indicates that $\mathrm { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ belongs to p-type semiconductors,as shown in Fig.3(b). Moreover, the temperature behaviors of $S$ for all the samples are similar: $S$ first increases and then decreases with increasing temperature, leaving a peak at around 430K.The decreases in $S$ at high temperature regimes can be ascribed to intrinsic excitation or thermal activation of minorityof carriers in the samples[24],similar to the behavior of the resistivity. One notices that there are no large changes in Seebeck coefficient for all samples with different sintering temperature or pressure at temperature $_ { \mathrm { T } > \sim 4 5 0 \mathrm { K } }$ ,but there are slightly decrease as the sintering temperature or pressure increases,a similar trend in the electrical resistivity $\rho$ is also observed. Hall coefficient measurements indicate that the hole concentration $p$ of all samples are in the same order of magnitude with the literature datal2l,as shown in table 1. One notice from table 1 that there no large changes for the hole concentration with different fabrication parameters. However, the mobility $\mu$ of the samples increases with increasing the sintering temperature or pressure. According to Mott expression[25]

where $\sigma , \ q , \ k _ { \mathrm { B } }$ and $\mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { f } }$ are the electrical conductivity, the carrier charge, the Boltzmann constant and the Fermi energy， respectively. One can see from equation (1） that $S$ increases (or decrease） with decreasing (or increasing) $p$ . Table 1 shows that the room-temperature $S$ decreases with increasing the sintering temperature or pressure. For example, under the pressure of ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { M P a }$ ，with increasing sintering temperature from 423 to 473K, the value of $S$ decreases from 117 to $9 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { V K } ^ { - 1 }$ accompanying with the increase in the mobility $\mu$ from 28 to $2 9 . 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { V } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { S } ^ { - 1 }$ and hole concentration $p$ from $1 . 1 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 0 }$ to $1 . 7 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ ， respectively. Room-temperature Hall coefficient measurement indicates that the carrier concentration $p$ for AST-423-150 and AST-473-150 are $7 . 8 0 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ and $2 . 1 8 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ respectively. It is worthwhile to note that Seebeck coefficient $S$ decreases as the carrier concentration $p$ （204 decreases for the samples AST-423-150 and AST-473-150.This indicates that other factor such as carrier mobility $\mu$ affecting the Seebeck coefficient. The results of Table 1 confirms that the carrier mobility $\mu$ for AST-423-150 and AST-473-150 increases from 2.96 to $1 0 . 9 \ \mathrm { c m ^ { 2 } V ^ { - 1 } S ^ { - 1 } }$ . The temperature dependence on power factor $P F$ of the samples has similar behavior with the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, as shown in Fig.3(c). In particular, the power factor $P F$ reaches $1 . 6 2 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \mathrm { W } { \cdot } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } { \cdot } \mathrm { K } ^ { - }$ ² at 418K for the sample AST-473-500.

As shown in Fig.3(d), the thermal conductivity $( \kappa )$ of all samples decrease with increasing temperature until about $4 2 5 \mathrm { K }$ , and then increase slowly with further increasing the temperature. We can see from Fig.3(d) that $\kappa$ increases with increasing sintering pressure at a certain sintering temperature, for example, $\kappa$ increases from 0.86 to 1.02,and then $1 . 1 5 \mathrm { W } { \cdot } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } { \cdot } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ with increasing sintering pressure from 150 to 300 and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$ for the samples AST-423-150,AST-423-300 and AST-423-500, respectively. The total thermal conductivity is the sum of the hole component $( \kappa _ { \mathrm { h } } )$ and phonon component $( \kappa _ { \mathrm { L } } )$ , in which $\kappa _ { \mathrm { h } } { = } \mathrm { L T } / \rho$ (Lorenz number $\mathrm { L } { = } 1 . 5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 8 } \mathrm { V } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 2 } ) ^ { [ 2 6 ] }$ according to the WiedemannFranz law. Fig.3(e) shows the temperature dependence of $\kappa _ { \mathrm { h } }$ . The lattice conductivity is obtained by extracting $\kappa _ { \mathrm { h } }$ from $\kappa$ ,displayed in Fig.3(f).By comparing Fig.3(d) with Fig.3(f), the lattice conductivity presents a similar temperature dependence with the total thermal conductivity,and dominates the values of total thermal conductivity. As seen in Fig.3(f), the lattice conductivity increases with increasing the sintering pressure for the samples sintered at $4 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ , for example, the value of $\boldsymbol { \kappa _ { \mathrm { L } } }$ increases from 0.68 to 0.77 and $0 . 9 0 \mathrm { W } { \cdot } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } { \cdot } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ with increasing the sintering pressure from 150 to 300 and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$

Based on the data obtained above, the temperature dependence of ZT for $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ compounds is shown in Fig.1.The ZT values of all samples show similar temperature dependences: it firstly increases with increasing temperature and then decreases with further increasing the temperature,leaving a peak at around 450K. The maximum ZTat room temperature is 0.31 for AST-423-150 hot-pressed at 423K and $1 5 0 \mathrm { { M P a } }$ ,and the maximum ZT reaches 0.86 at 475K for AST-423-500 hot-pressed at 423K and ${ 5 0 0 } \mathrm { { M P a } }$ due to the lower thermal conductivity and higher power factor.

# 4. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have synthesized $\mathsf { A g S b T e } _ { 2 }$ compounds by fusion method, and investigated their thermoelectric properties in the temperature range of 300-55oK under different hot-pressing condition. The electrical resistivity $\rho$ and Seebeck coefficient $S$ decrease with increasing the sintering temperature and /or pressure, especially, the power factor PF reaches a highest value of $1 . 6 2 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \mathrm { W } { \cdot } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } { \cdot } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 2 }$ at 418K for the sample AST-473-500. Thermal conductivity $\kappa$ increases with increasing sintering pressure at a certain sintering temperature, and a minimum of $\kappa { = } 0 . 6 5 ~ \mathrm { W { \cdot } m ^ { - 1 } { \cdot } K ^ { - 1 } }$ is obtained at 423K for the sample AST-423-150.As a result, the highest $Z \mathrm { T } { = } 0 . 8 6$ is achieved at 475K for the sample AST-423-500 hotpressed at 423K and 50oMPa due to the lower thermal conductivity and higher power factor.
