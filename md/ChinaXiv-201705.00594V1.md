SnCdxTe materials were synthesized by the zone-melting method for this thermoelectric performance study.The X-ray diffraction results show that the latice parameter decreases with increasing $x ,$ following Vegard's law of rock-salt structure SnTe and CdTe. Besides,the room temperature Seebeck coeficients of the $\mathsf { S n C d } _ { x } \mathsf { T } \epsilon$ system are enhanced to ${ > } 6 0 \mu \ V \kappa ^ { - 1 } .$ .larger than those of Cd-doped SnTe synthesized by spark plasma sintering.A large power factor of ${ \sim } 2 5 \mu \mathsf { W } \mathsf { c m } ^ { - 1 } \mathsf { K } ^ { - 1 }$ is achieved in $\mathsf { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 2 } \mathsf { T e }$ at $8 2 0 ~ \mathsf { K } ,$ （204号 which rivals those of high performance PbTe-based materials.As a result, the highest $Z T$ of ${ \sim } 1 . 0 3$ at 820 K was achieved for SnCdo.12Te.

# Introduction

Thermoelectric materials,which can directly generate electrical power from a heat source,draw lots of attention for potential applications in waste heat recovery.1-3 The conversion efficient is defined by a dimensionless number, the figure merit $Z T =$ $S ^ { 2 } \sigma T / \kappa _ { \mathrm { t o t } } ,$ where $S , \sigma , T _ { : }$ and $K _ { \mathrm { t o t } }$ are the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity, the absolute temperature,and the total thermal conductivity, respectively.

Lead telluride and its alloys are the best thermoelectric materials in the middle/high temperature range,while the element lead causes some concerns about environmental pollution.Recently，lead-free SnTe was expected to become a possible alternative to PbTe,because they have a similar rocksalt structure $\left( F m \bar { 3 } m \right)$ and electronic band structures.4,5 However,the highest $Z T$ ofSnTe was found to be around o.5,far below the values of ${ \sim } 2 . 0$ for PbTe alloys.6,7 SnTe possesses too high a hole-carrier concentration $( \sim 1 0 ^ { 2 1 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } )$ due to intrinsic Sn vacancies, resulting in low Seebeck coefficients.89 Besides, SnTe has a smaller band gap $( 0 . 1 8 ~ \mathrm { { \ e V } ) }$ and larger energy difference $\left( 0 . 3 5 ~ \mathrm { e V } \right)$ between the light-hole band at the $L$ point and the heavy-hole band at the $\Sigma$ point compared to those of PbTe ( $\mathrm { \widetilde { 0 . 3 0 e V } }$ and $0 . 1 7 \ \mathrm { e V }$ ,respectively).10,11

Studies have shown that the carrier concentration can be optimized to ${ 1 0 } ^ { 1 9 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 2 0 } ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ through doping or selfcompensation.12-15 More importantly,recent attempts have been made to modify the valence band structure of SnTe to improve its thermoelectric performance.Zhang et al. reported that In doping can form resonance levels in the valence band of SnTe and greatly improve the Seebeck coeffcient.16 Moreover,alloying with Hg,Cd,Mg,Mn, and $\mathrm { \sf A g ( I ) }$ has been reported to enlarge the band gap and decrease the energy separation between the light-hole band and heavy-hole band,validating effective band convergence.12,17-24 First principle calculations have shown that Cd and $\mathbf { H } \mathbf { g }$ are more efficient in enhancing the Seebeck coefficients though band tuning than $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { g }$ and Mn.25 Nevertheless, the reported low solubility limit $( \leq 3 \% )$ of Cd or Hg in SnTe confines further improvement of the thermoelectric performance.

In the previous report where Cd-doped SnTe alloys were synthesized by SPS processing, the lattice parameter increases as the doping concentration increases.1² CdTe usually forms the zinc-blend-type crystal structure $( F \bar { 4 } 3 m )$ with a lattice parameter of $6 . 4 8 \mathrm { \stackrel { \circ } { A } } . \mathrm { \ } ^ { 2 6 , 2 7 }$ Only in some special conditions, such as under high pressures,can CdTe form the rock-salt-type crystal structure $\left( F m \bar { 3 } m \right)$ ,and the lattice parameter of $5 . 8 1 \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ is smaller than the $6 . 3 1 4 \mathring { \mathrm { ~ A ~ } }$ of SnTe.28,29 According to Vegard's law, the latice parameter of $\mathrm { S n } _ { 1 - x } \mathbf { C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ should decrease with increasing $x$ Besides,the smaller Seebeckcoeffcients of Cd doped SnTe than those of $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { g }$ or Mn doped SnTe at room temperature is also not consistent with first principle calculations.17-23,25 Therefore, Cd substitution in SnTe needs further confirmation for thermoelectric performance optimization.

In this work,we synthesize a series of high quality $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ $( x = 0  – 0 . 1 5 )$ by the zone-melting method.The structure and thermoelectric properties have been carefully studied.Our results suggest that Cd substitution in Sn sites can significantly enhancetheSeebeckcoefficient.

# Experimental

Samples with nominal compositions of $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ 1 $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { x } } = \mathbf { \boldsymbol { 0 } }$ ，0.01, 0.03,0.05,0.07,0.09,0.12,and 0.15) were synthesized by mixing appreciated ratios of high purity starting materials (Sn granule $( 1 - 3 \ \mathrm { m m } , \ 5 \ \mathrm { N } )$ ，Te chunk (5 N),Cd granule (5 N)) in quartz ampoules. The ampoules were evacuated to a pressure of $\sim { 1 0 } ^ { - 2 }$ Pa,flame-sealed,and heated to $1 1 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ in a rocking furnace.The alloys were then grown in a zone melting furnace at $1 1 2 3 \mathrm { K }$ with a growth speed of $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } ~ \mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ . The samples were cut into $1 0 \times 2$ $\times \ : 2 \ : \mathrm { \ m m } ^ { 3 }$ bars and $\phi \ 1 0 \times 2 \ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ plates to measure their thermoelectric properties.Only the middle of the ingots were cut for measurements of thermoelectric performance.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted in reflection geometry on a Bruker AXs diffractometer. The microstructures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (JEOL 2100HR) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TF20). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXs) was performed with the Si (Li) detector of an EDAX system (Gemsis Software V 4.61) to confirm the homogeneous composition of the samples.

The Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity were measured on an Ulvac Japan ZEM-3 instrument under a low pressure helium atmosphere from room temperature to $8 2 0 ~ \mathrm { K } .$ The uncertainty of the Seebeck and electrical conductivity measurements is $5 \%$ . The thermal conductivity was calculated from the values of the thermal diffusivity(λ),the density $( \rho )$ ,and the specific heat capacity $\left( C _ { \mathrm { p } } \right)$ by the relationship $\kappa _ { \mathrm { t o t } } = \lambda \rho C _ { \mathrm { p } }$ whereλwas measured using the laser flash diffusivity method in a Netzsch LFA-457 in the range from $3 0 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ to $8 2 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ see Fig. S1 (ESI), $\dagger \boldsymbol { \rho }$ was determined using the Archimedes principle (Table S1,ESI†),and $C _ { \mathrm { p } }$ was calculated based on the previous report.14 The uncertainty of the thermal conductivity was estimated to be within $1 0 \%$ .The effective carrier concentration $( n )$ was estimated using the relationship $n = 1 / ( e R _ { \mathrm { H } } )$ ,where $e$ is the elemental charge, $R _ { \mathrm { H } }$ is the Hall coefficient that was measured bya physical properties measurement system (Quantum Design,PPMS-9) in magnetic fields ranging from 0 to $5 \mathrm { T }$ The Hall mobility $( \mu )$ was calculated using the relationship $\mu = \sigma R _ { \mathrm { H } } ^ { }$

# Results and discussions

All $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ 0 $\overset { \cdot } { x } = 0$ ,0.01,0.03,0.05,0.07,0.09,0.12,and 0.15) alloys crystallize in the rock-salt type structure (space group no. $2 2 5 , F m \bar { 3 } m \bar { . }$ ,as shown in Fig.1a.No second phase is observed within the detection limit of XRD.The lattice parameters were calculated according to the reflection peak positions and plotted in Fig.1b.Different from the previous report,1² the lattice parameter decreases with increasing Cd content. The dashed line in Fig.1b demonstrates Vegard's law of rock-salt type SnTe $( 6 . 3 1 4 \mathring { \mathbf { A } } )$ and CdTe (5.81 A).26,27,29,30For $x \leq 0 . 0 3$ the lattice parameter follows Vegard's law，suggesting Cd substitution on Sn sites.From $x = 0 . 0 5$ ,the lattice parameter starts to deviate from Vegard's law,and shows less deviation for $x \geq 0 . 0 7$ .The smallest lattice parameter of $\sim 6 . 2 9 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ suggests a solution limit of $4 \%$ Cd in SnTe according to Vegard's law, which is consistent with previous studies.31 The EDXS results also confirm the Cd amount in SnTe (Table $\mathrm { ~ } S 2 , \mathrm { ~ E S I \dag ~ }$ ）

The temperature dependence of electrical conductivity for all samples is shown in Fig.2a.For each sample,the electrical conductivity decreases with increasing temperature from $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ to $8 2 0 { \mathrm { ~ K } } .$ ，The electrical conductivity gradually decreases with increasing Cd amount.At room temperature,the electrical conductivity decreases from $\sim 8 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { S } ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for pristine SnTe to ${ \sim } 1 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { S } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for $x = 0 . 1 5$ .It should be noted that the decrease rate is smaller than in the previous report,in which the electrical conductivity show smaller changes for $x > 0 . 0 2$ .12For the same Cd content of O.o3，the electrical conductivity of our sample was ${ \sim } 4 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { S } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at room temperature and 1150 S $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at $8 2 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ ,compared to ${ \sim } 2 7 0 0 \mathrm { S c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and $\sim 5 0 0 \mathrm { ~ S ~ c m } ^ { - 1 }$ in the previous report.12

Fig.2 Temperature dependence of electrical performance for $\mathsf { S n C d } _ { x } \mathsf { T e } \colon$ (a) electrical conductivity: (b) Seebeck coefficient.

The Seebeck coefficients as a function of temperature are exhibited inFig.2b.The Seebeck coefficients gradually improve with the Cd amount until $x = 0 . 1 2$ ,and then decrease slightly for $x = 0 . 1 5$ .It is slightly different from the previous report where the Seebeck coefficients for Cd-doped SnTe samples by SPS processing are almost the same for $x > 0 . 0 2$ .12Moreover,for $x > 0 . 0 3$ the slope in the $s$ vs. $T$ plot decreases with increasing temperature.Similar phenomena have been observed in Hgdoped and Mn-doped SnTe.17,22 For $x = 0 . 1 2$ ,the Seebeck coefficient nearly saturates at $8 2 0 \mathrm { K }$ .The highest Seebeck coefficient of ${ \sim } 2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { V } ~ \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ at $8 2 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ in our sample is consistent with in the value obtained from the Cd-doped SnTe by SPS processing.12

Previous studies have shown that alloying $\mathrm { H g } ,$ Cd,Mn,or $\mathbf { M g } ^ { }$ with SnTe can validate the effective band convergence and enhances thermoelectric performance.17-19 First principle calculations have shown that $3 \%$ Cd in SnTe can enlarge the band gap to $0 . 2 1 \ \mathrm { e V }$ and reduce the energy difference between the two valence bands to $0 . 0 6 7 \mathrm { e V } .$ 25 While the same amount of Mg and Mn can only reduce the energy difference to $0 . 1 3 \ \mathrm { e V }$ 25

Such a trend indicates Cd-doping is more efficient than Mn- or Mg-doping to achieve high Seebeck coefficients.

The room temperature Seebeck coefficients of $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ samples were plotted as a function of carrier concentration in Fig.3.The previous data for Cd-alloyed,Mn-alloyed,and Mgalloyed SnTe and the theoretical Pisarenko curve are also plotted for comparison.10,16-18,21 The Seebeck coeffcients of all alloyed SnTe are above the Pisarenko curve.When the carrier concentration is in the range of 2 to $3 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ ，the Cddoped SnTe from SPS processing shows smaller Seebeck coefficients than $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { g }$ -doped and Mn-doped SnTe.It can be seen that our results are above the data of Mg-doped and Mn-doped SnTe, which is consistent with the results of first principle calculations.The Seebeck coefficient of $6 2 \mu \mathrm { V } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ at room temperature for $\mathbf { S n C d _ { 0 . 1 2 } T e }$ is comparable with $\mathbf { H } \mathbf { g } .$ -doped and In-doped SnTe.16,17

The temperature dependence of power factors for the $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ samples is plotted in Fig.4a.Compared to the pristine SnTe，the power factors of Cd-doped samples are greatly enhanced in the temperature range from $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ to $7 5 0 \mathrm { K }$ ,due to theimproved Seebeck coefficients.The highest power factor was found to be ${ \sim } 2 5 \mu \mathrm { W } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 2 }$ at $8 2 0 \mathrm { K }$ in $\mathrm { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 2 } \mathrm { T e }$ ,which is larger than that $\left( \sim 2 0 \mu \mathrm { W } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 2 } \right)$ of the reported Cd-doped SnTe and rivals those of high performance PbTe-based materials.32,33

The total thermal conductivity for the $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ system shows a significant decreasing tendency with increasing Cd fraction (Fig.4b).The room temperature thermal conductivity decreases from 8.6 W $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ for pristine SnTe to 3.1 W $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ for $\mathbf { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 2 } \mathrm { T e }$ ，and then increases a little for $\mathrm { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 5 } \mathrm { T e }$ The lowest thermal conductivity of ${ \sim } 1 . 9 \ \mathrm { W } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } \ \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ was found in $\mathbf { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 2 } \mathrm { T e }$ above $6 0 0 \ \mathrm { K } .$ ，The lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa _ { \mathrm { l a t } }$ was calculated by subtracting the electrical thermal conductivity $\kappa _ { \mathrm { e l e } }$ from the total thermal conductivity.The electrical thermal conductivity was calculated using the WiedemannFranz relationship $\kappa _ { \mathrm { e l e } } = L \sigma T _ { \mathrm { : } }$ ，where $L$ is the Lorenz number. Lorenz numbers are obtained by fitting the Seebeck coefficient to the reduced chemical potential.34-36 see Fig. S1 $\left( \mathrm { E S I } \dagger \right)$ . The lattice thermal conductivity for $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ samples are plotted in Fig.4c.Even though some doped samples show lower lattice thermal conductivity than pristine SnTe,there is no accurately definitive dependence between $\kappa _ { \mathrm { l a t } }$ and $x .$ 、The modification of total thermal conductivity is mainly due to the control of electrical conductivity.Similar phenomena have been found in doped SnTe alloys.15,20 The lowest lattice thermal conductivity stays around $1 . 0 \mathrm { ~ W ~ m ~ } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { ~ K ~ } ^ { - 1 }$ ， Such a value is still very high compared to high performance PbTe alloys,2,33 and is also higher than one $( \sim 0 . 7 ~ \mathrm { W ~ m } ^ { - 1 } ~ \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 } )$ of the alloys from SPS pro cessing. Normally， the reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity results from strong phonon scattering caused by point defects,dislocations,grain boundaries,and so on.Here, the TEM shows that some dislocations exist in the $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ samples and no second phase is observed (Fig. S3, $\mathrm { E S I \dag }$ ，sug gesting that only dislocations and point defects contribute to additional phonon scattering. Further optimization in the lattice thermal conductivity is expected to achieve better thermoelectric performance.

The ZT values as a function of temperature are plotted in Fig.4d.After doping Cd, the $Z T$ values are enhanced greatly. Compared to pure SnTe,the highest $Z T$ at $8 2 0 \ \mathrm { K }$ is enhanced ${ \sim } 0 . 4 5$ to ${ \sim } 0 . 9$ for $\mathbf { S n C d } _ { 0 . 0 9 } \mathbf { T e }$ and further to 1.03 for $\mathrm { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 2 } \mathrm { T e }$ 业 The highest $Z T$ of 1.03 in the $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ samples synthesized by zone-melting is not a great improvement compared to that of 0.96 in samples by SPS processing.One probable reason is the higher lattice thermal conductivity.Higher ZT values can be expected by further decreasing $\kappa _ { \mathrm { l a t } }$ via nanocomposites or alloys.

# Conclusions

We synthesized a series of high quality materials of $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ by the zone-melting method.The lattice parameter of $\mathrm { s n C d } _ { x } \mathrm { T e }$ decreases with increasing $x$ ，suggesting Cd substitution in Sn sites.The electrical and thermal conductivity decrease with increasing $x$ ,and the Seebeck coefficients are greatly enhanced. At room temperature,the Seebeck coefficients of Cd-doped SnTe samples by zone-melting are larger than those of Mgdoped and Mn-doped SnTe,consistent with first principle calculations.A high power factor of ${ \sim } 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { W }$ cm $\mathbf { K } ^ { - 2 }$ at $8 2 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ was achieved in $\mathrm { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 2 } \mathrm { T e }$ .As aresult, the highest ZT of 1.03 was obtained for $\mathrm { S n C d } _ { 0 . 1 2 } \mathrm { T e }$ at $8 2 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$
