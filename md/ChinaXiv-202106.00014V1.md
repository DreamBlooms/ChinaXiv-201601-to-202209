Abstract: Groundwater is a vital water resource in arid and semi-arid areas. Diurnal groundwater table fluctuations are widely used to quantify rainfall recharge and groundwater evapotranspiration $\mathrm { ( E T _ { g } ) }$ . To assess groundwater resources for sustainable use, we estimated groundwater recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ using the diurnal water table fluctuations at three sites along a section with different depths to water table (DWT) within a wetland of the Mukai Lake in the Ordos Plateau,Northwest China. The water table level was monitored at an hourly resolution using a Keller DCX-22A data logger that measured both the total pressure and barometric presure, so that the effect of barometric pressure could be removed. At this study site,a rapid water table response to rainfall was observed in two shallow wells (i.e.,， Obs1 and Obs2),at which diurnal water table fluctuations were also observed over the study period during rainless days, indicating that the main factors influencing water table variation are rainfall and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } } .$ However,at the deep-water table site (Obs3),the groundwater level only reacted to the heaviest rainfals and showed no diurnal variations. Groundwater recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ were quantified for the entire hydrological year (June 2017-June 2018) using the water table fluctuation method and the Loheide method, respectively， with depth-dependent specific yields. The results show that the total annual groundwater recharge was approximately $2 0 7 ~ \mathrm { \ m m }$ ， accounting for $52 \%$ of rainfall at Obs1，while groundwater recharge was approximately 250 and $2 1 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ at Obs2 and Obs3, accounting for $63 \%$ and $5 \%$ of rainfall, respectively. In addition, the rates of groundwater recharge were mainly determined by rainfallintensity and DWT. The daily mean $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at Obs1 and $\mathrm { O b s } 2$ over the study period was 4.3 and $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ , respectively, and the main determining factors were DWT and net radiation.

# 二 Introduction

In (semi-) arid regions, groundwater plays a significant role in meeting urban, industrial, and agricultural water requirements because of the unreliability or under-allocation of surface water. Globally， more than two bilion people depend on groundwater, and approximately $50 \%$ of irrigation water is obtained from groundwater (Alley et al., 20O2; Siebert et al., 201O). Due to unsustainable development practices, groundwater depletion has taken place in many regional aquifers worldwide, such as the North China Plain (Feng et al., 2O13), the US High Plains (Scanlon et al., 2O12),and the Nubian sandstone aquifer in North Africa (Doll et al., 2014).

Groundwater budget analysis is a critical component for the sustainable use of groundwater resources (Bredehoeft, 1997; Zhou, 2O09) and the main components of groundwater budgets are rainfall recharge and groundwater evapotranspiration $\mathrm { ( E T _ { g } ) }$ (Crosbie et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2016). Many methods are available for estimating the infiltration recharge from rainfal and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ including soil water balance (Allison et al.， 1994; Gribovszki, 2018), water table fluctuations (WTFs) (Cheng et al.,2017; Delottier et al., 2018; Wang et al.,2019a) and numerical simulations (Loheide et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2014). Among these methods, the WTF (water table fluctuation) method is considered to be effective for quantifying rainfall recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ because of its simplicity and ease of use (Healy and Cook, 2OO2). The application of WTF to estimate groundwater recharge can be traced back to the 192Os (Meinzer, 1923). The procedure used to estimate daily $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ using diurnal WTFs was first developed by White (1932), but this method has only been widely used in recent decades because of the availability of automatic high-resolution groundwater data loggers that can detect millimeter-scale variations (Wang et al.， 2019b; Gribovszki et al., 20i0; Diouf et al., 2020). With recently applied modifications, the sub-daily $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ can be estimated from diurnal WTFs (Gribovszki et al., 2008; Loheide, 2008; Yin et al., 2013).

Water tables in wetlands are shallow because of the convergence of surface runoff and lateral groundwater flows (Toth, 1962; Fan et al.， 2013). Consequently， plant species are abundant around wetlands because of the high availability of water for their use (Busch et al., 1992; Sargeant and Singer, 2O16). However, unsustainable groundwater use may degrade wetland ecosystems. For example, groundwater-dependent willows died after two years of groundwater pumping in a wetland in the USA (Scott et al., 2000).

The Ordos Plateau is located in Northwest China, where approximately 4OO lake wetlands are present (Yin et al., 2O1la). Natural resources are extremely abundant in the Ordos Plateau, including petroleum, natural gas, coal, and sandstone type uranium deposits (Chang et al., 2006). It contains the greatest natural gas reserves and the second greatest coal reserves in China (Dai et al., 2006). In recent years, groundwater from the area has been pumped out in increasing volumes to sustain the rapid development of the Ordos National Energy Base (Hou et al., 2O08). The effects of overexploitation have already been observed in some areas,resulting in the drying up of artesian wells， degradation of groundwater quality， and dieback of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (Liu et al.， 2O15). This is due to the improper quantification of water budget components that adversely affect the sustainable development of groundwater resources and groundwater-dependent plants in lake wetlands (Liu et al.， 2O17). In previous studies on the groundwater budget in the Ordos Plateau (Wang et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2018), groundwater recharge was determined to be the product of annual rainfall and the coefficient of rainfall, without considering the impact of rainfall intensity, antecedent rainfall, and the depth to water table (DWT) on groundwater recharge. $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ was calculated based on the linear relationship between the evapotranspiration (ET) flux at the surface and DWT. However, numerous studies indicate that this relationship is more complex than what can be effectively represented by a linear model (Baird and Maddock, 2Oo5; Doble and Crosbie, 2017).

To improve water budget estimates, it is vital to quantify rainfall infiltration and groundwater evapotranspiration, as well as their main controlling factors. Therefore， hourly water table variations were monitored at three sites over a hydrological year in the semi-arid wetland around a lake in the Ordos Plateau. We estimated groundwater recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ based on the monitoring data, and analyzed their controlling factors, such as DWT, rainfall intensity, and antecedent rainfall. The objectives of this study were to: (1) explore the response of the water table to rainfall and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at different depths along a section; (2) estimate groundwater recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ using a depth-dependent specific yield; and (3) determine the hourly, daily, and monthly variations of rainfall infiltration and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ ， as well as to quantify their controlling factors to explore the mechanisms affecting rainfall infiltration and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at different time scales.

# 2Materials and methods

# 2.1 Study site and experimental setup

The study site $( 3 9 ^ { \circ } 1 7 ^ { \prime } 2 6 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { N }$ $1 0 8 ^ { \circ } 4 9 ^ { \prime } 1 7 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ was located within the wetland of Mukai Lake in the Ordos Plateau, Northwest China (Fig. 1a). Geographically, it is located in the Middle East Ordos Plateau, where the climate is semi-arid and characterized by low rainfall and high $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ . The study site was located within an area where groundwater recharges lakes (Yin et al., 2O1la; Liu et al., 2015). The phreatophyte near the lake was native grasses， mainly Carex stenophylla and Puccinellia tenuifolia, with a root depth of approximately $8 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ . Although groundwater had not been extracted from this lake wetland, an adjacent lake wetland area was heavily pumped, and corresponding adverse environmental effects have been observed there, such as wetland shrinkage and ecosystem degradation (Liu et al., 2015, 2018). The local government is planning to reassess safe pumping rates and requires a detailed water budget analysis. Because of the similar hydrogeological and meteorological conditions, the results of this study can provide a reference for other lake wetlands in the Ordos Plateau.

Piezometers were placed in holes drilled with a hand auger at three observation sites, Obs1, Obs2, and Obs3, to form a transect perpendicular to the lake (Fig. 1b). The land surface slope and hydraulic gradient along the section were $1 . 7 \%$ and $1 . 0 \%$ ，respectively. The depth of the piezometers varied between 2 and $4 \mathrm { m }$ , depending on the DWT of the site. Each was constructed using a PVC pipe with a diameter of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ， screened over the entire length of the subsurface. Augured sand was backfilled around the piezometers, and granular bentonite was then packed around the land surface to avoid preferential flow. The PVC pipes were capped to prevent direct rainfall and evaporation losses. The distance between Obs1 and Obs2 was approximately $3 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ while the distance between Obs2 and Obs3 was approximately $2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ .Obs1 and Obs2 were located in the low-lying area where the vadose zone consisted of fine to silty sand.In contrast, Obs3 was in the uplands, where both sand and sandstone lay within the unsaturated zone (Fig. 1b).

The hourly water table was monitored with a Keller DCX-22A data logger (Keller AG für Druckmesstechnik, Switzerland) that measured both the total pressure and barometric pressure, to account for the effect of barometric pressure. The barometric pressure transducers were positioned in a buffered thermal condition to exclude thermal effects (McLaughlin, 2011). A five-point moving average was used to smooth the groundwater level data (Loheide, 2008).

A rain gauge (Onset Computer, USA) was installed to monitor hourly rainfall approximately $4 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ east of Obs3. Daily reference evapotranspiration $( \mathrm { E T _ { 0 } } )$ was calculated using an $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ calculator (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Italy). The required meteorological data (i.e.， net radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed) were collected from the closest meteorological station.

The closest meteorological station is approximately $2 0 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ southeast of the study area, but its monitoring data can represent the meteorological conditions of the study site because of its flat topography. Based on long-term data (2OoO-2O17), the mean annual precipitation is $3 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，with a significant annual variation indicated by a coeficient of variation (CV) of O.3. Over $70 \%$ of the annual precipitation falls from June to September (Fig. 1c), and rainfall events with less than $5 \mathrm { m m }$ are dominant, accounting for $72 \%$ of the total events (data not shown). The $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ calculated by the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998) is fairly stable at $1 1 5 0 \ \mathrm { m m / a }$ ，with a CV as low as 0.1. The monthly $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ ranges from $2 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in January to $2 0 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in May, with an average value of $1 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { m m } }$ . The annual mean air temperature is approximately $7 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ， with a maximum of $2 2 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in July and a minimum of $- 1 1 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in January (Fig. 1c).

# 2.2Groundwater recharge estimation

The WTF method is widely applied for estimating the groundwater recharge of shallow unconfined aquifers, assuming that the rise of the water table in unconfined aquifers results solely from rainfall infiltration (Healy and Cook, 2OO2; Varni et al., 2O13). The method is best applied in areas with shallow water tables that demonstrate sharp rises in the water table over short time periods. A previous study (Yin et al., 2O11b) indicated that the WTF method is applicable to this study site. Groundwater recharge $( R )$ is calculated as follows:

$$
R = \frac { S _ { y } d h } { d t } = \frac { S _ { y } \Delta h } { \Delta t } ,
$$

where $S _ { y }$ is the specific yield; $d$ is the DWT (cm); $h$ is the hydraulic head (cm); $t$ is the time (h); $\Delta h$ is defined as the difference between the peak of the rise and the low point of the extrapolated antecedent recession curve at the time of the peak to determine the total recharge; and $\Delta t$ is the time span corresponding to $\Delta h$ ：

# 2.3 $\mathbf { E T _ { g } }$ estimation

Several methods are available for estimating $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ based on diurnal WTFs, including those based on the water balance principle (White,1932; Loheide, 2008) and those based on statistical theory (Soylu et al., 2012; Wang and Pozdniakov, 2014). The method developed by Loheide (2008) was adopted here because of its capability to estimate hourly groundwater consumption, rather than daily values commonly obtained from other methods. A method comparison conducted previously also indicated that the Loheide method yielded the most accurate estimation (Yin et al., 2O13). The Loheide method is based on three assumptions: (1) the decline in groundwater levels is only due to plant root water uptake and surface evaporation; (2) $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ consumed by vegetation is negligible from midnight to O6:OO; and (3) the rate of head change at the recovery source is equal to the overall rate of water table change at the observation location. The $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ can be calculated using the groundwater balance equation:

$$
\mathrm { E T } _ { \mathrm { g } } \left( t \right) = r ( t ) - S _ { \mathrm { y } } \times \frac { \Delta h } { \Delta t } ,
$$

where $r ( t )$ is the net inflow rate of groundwater $\left( \mathrm { m m / h } \right) ; S _ { \boldsymbol { y } }$ is the specific yield of sediments; and $\Delta h / \Delta t$ is the change in DWT per unit time $\mathrm { ( m m / h ) }$ . Because of the assumption that the rate of head change at the recovery source is equal to the overallrate of water table change at the observation location, the detrended water table depth $( \mathrm { W T _ { D T } ) }$ is obtained by subtracting this trend from a portion of the observed water table records as follows:

$$
\mathbf { W } \mathbf { T } _ { \mathrm { D T } } ( t ) = \mathbf { W } \mathbf { T } ( t ) - m _ { T } \times t - b _ { T } ,
$$

where $\mathbf { W } \mathbf { T } ( t )$ is the measured water table $\left( \mathrm { m m } \right)$ ; and $m _ { T }$ and $b _ { T }$ are the slope $\mathrm { { ( m m / h ) } }$ and intercept of the trend (mm), respectively. A relationship can be determined to predict $d \mathbf { W } \mathbf { T } _ { \mathrm { D T } } / d t$ as a function, $\Gamma ( \mathrm { W T _ { D T } ) }$ ，of the detrended DWT using periods of zero $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ . Subsequently, the net inflow rate of groundwater can be estimated using the following equation:

$$
r ( t ) = S _ { y } \times \big [ \Gamma ( \mathbf { W } \mathrm { T } _ { \mathrm { D T } } ( t ) ) + m _ { T } \big ] .
$$

As the fastest recovery of the water table occurred around 21:0O (LST) at Obs1 and 00:00 at Obs2 (Fig. 2a), the groundwater inflow was calculated using the recovery period from 21:00 to 05:00 at Obs1 and 00:00 to 06:00 at Obs2, following the suggestion of Yin et al. (2013) that the fastest recovery of water table is an indicator of the suspension of $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$

# 2.4Specific yield estimation

It should be noted that $S _ { y }$ is the most crucial factor in determining the accuracy of recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ (Nachabe, 2002; Loheide et al., 2005; Gribovszki, 2017). $S _ { y }$ is defined as the volume of water released under gravity from storage per unit cross-sectional area, per unit decline in the water table (Freeze and Cherry， 1979). When the water table is deep $( > 1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ } )$ ，the application of a constant $S _ { y }$ is valid (Duke, 1972; Soylu et al., 2012). However, depth-dependent $S _ { y }$ should be considered in shallow water table conditions (Crosbie et al., 2O05; Loheide, et al., 2OO5; Fan et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2017) . At Obs1 and Obs2, with shallow water tables, two methods were employed to estimate $S _ { y }$ . The relationship between $S _ { y }$ and DWT can be described by Equation 5.

$$
S _ { y } = \theta _ { s } - \left[ \theta _ { r } + \frac { \theta _ { s } - \theta _ { r } } { \left( 1 + ( \alpha d ) ^ { n } \right) ^ { m } } \right] ,
$$

where $d$ is the DWT (cm); $\theta _ { s }$ is the saturated soil moisture $( \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ; $\theta _ { r }$ is the residual soil moisture $( \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ; and $a , n$ ，and $m$ are the empirical coefficients in the van Genuchten model (van Genuchten, 198O). Undisturbed soil samples were collected every $2 0 \mathrm { c m }$ from the excavated profiles. Bulk density was estimated by the oven drying method, and particle-size distributions were determined by the sieving method for the sand fractions and by a soil hydrometer for the silt and clay fractions, respectively.

$S _ { y }$ was also determined by the water table response to rainfall events, as the ratio of infiltrated rainfall to recorded rise in water table level. Rainfall events were only considered when soil moisture was likely to be replenished by previous rainfall. The interception loss by the plant canopy was ignored because the grasses were small and sparsely distributed at the study sites. The $S _ { y }$ of sandstone at Obs3 was assumed to be constant because the water table was deeper than $3 \mathrm { m }$ We assigned the value of 0.08 to $S _ { y }$ based on a previous study (Yin et al.， 2O11b)，which determined it through a pumping test that used the type-curve method.

# 3Results and discussion

# 3.1 Variation of water table

The monitored DWT values at Obs1 and Obs2 from December 2017 to March 2018 were excluded because the soil was frozen. The patterns of water table variations were strongly related to DWT. At Obs1, Obs2, and Obs3, DWT varied between 0 and 70, 0 and 100, and 330 and 370 cm,respectively (Fig. 2a)，with mean values of 20,60,and $3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ ，respectively. Hourly groundwater levels at Obs1 responded to rainfall rapidly (usually within $^ { \textrm { 1 h } }$ ,data not shown), and levels were the highest among the three observation sites. The water table at Obs2 had similar but somewhat slower responses to rainfall (within $\mathsf { 1 { - } } 2 \ \mathrm { h } \bar { }$ ） and was lower compared to that at Obs1. For example, the water table raised by $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ following a rainfall of $1 1 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m m / d }$ on 8 July 2017, at Obs2, while it rose by $2 7 \ \mathrm { c m }$ at Obs1. The water table at Obs3 displayed a smooth and seasonal variation,and only reacted to heavy rainfall at the end of July and October, with a delay of approximately four days (Fig. 2a).

Diurnal fluctuations were observed for the entire observation period at Obs1, except during rainy periods (Fig. 2a). At Obs2, diurnal signals were obvious when the DWT was less than 75 cm,and diminished when the water table was lower, a behavior previously observed by others (Mould et al., 2O1O; Nippert et al., 2010). The diurnal magnitude was much higher at Obs1 than at Obs2, which had a deeper water table. For instance, the mean magnitude was $4 . 4 \mathrm { c m }$ during 5-14 June 2018 at Obs1, three times higher than that at Obs2 (Fig. 2a). It was also observed that the water table began to decline approximately $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ earlier at Obs1 than at Obs2 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the water table at Obs3 did not show any diurnal fluctuations (Fig. 2a). The response to rainfall and the magnitude of diurnal fluctuations are attributed to the thickness of the unsaturated zones, which determines whether plants can extract groundwater.

The seasonal water table regime was controlled by meteorological conditions (rainfall and $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } } \dot { }$ ） In the study area,a hydrological year can be divided into a dry season (April-mid-July) and a wet season (the remaining period) (Yin et al., 2015). The DWT at Obs1 and Obs2 also reflected the characteristics of dry and wet seasons (Fig. 2c). In the dry season, the water table generally declined in response to lower rainfall and high $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ , while in the wet season, the water table rose because of the increase in rainfall and decline in $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$

# 3.2 Specific yield $( S _ { y } )$

Soil texture analysis indicated that the soil was quite homogenous at Obs1 and Obs2; therefore, a uniform texture was assumed to estimate $S _ { y }$ using Equation 5. $S _ { y }$ estimated using the water table response to rainfall and by soil texture, decreased with DWT (Fig. 3). The sample data and fitted exponential function ( $R ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 7 5$ ， $P { < } 0 . 0 1 \$ ） are shown in Figure 3. For silty sand soils, such as those at our sites, $S _ { y }$ was found to increase with DWT and also fitted an exponential pattern, reaching a relatively stable value within $1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (Crosbie et al., 2005; Fan et al., 2014; Hill and Durchholz, 2015； Cheng et al., 2O17). The relationship indicated that $S _ { y }$ varied significantly, with the difference of an order of magnitude in extreme cases, suggesting that ignoring $S _ { y }$ variations will result in substantial interpretation errors at sites with a shallow water table.

However, it should be noted that $S _ { y }$ from the water table response method was lower than that obtained using the soil texture method (Fig. 3). Differences have been widely observed among $S _ { y }$ obtained from commonly used methods, that is, soil texture, drainage, and water table response methods (Fan et al.， 2014; Gribovszki， 2017). Method comparisons indicate that $S _ { y }$ values obtained using the water table response method are suitable for analyzing groundwater recharge, as the same temporal and spatial scales are used (Crosbie et al., 2Oo5). Therefore, $S _ { y }$ from the water table response method was applied to estimate the groundwater recharge, whereas $S _ { y }$ from the soil texture method was used to calculate $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$

![](images/e1172f6b10aa36e8cac35d4d558cddb5877e851c90386e6687fd59cbb0fe7930.jpg)  
Fig.3Increases in specific yield $( S _ { y } )$ with DWT using the water table response method and the soil texture method

Soil water moisture before rainfall is a vital factor when using the water table response method to estimate $S _ { y }$ . Rainfall recharges soil water if the water content of the unsaturated zone is low, leading to an overestimation of $S _ { y }$ . Therefore, such rainfall events were only considered when soil moisture in the unsaturated zone was likely to be replenished by previous rainfall within one week of $S _ { y }$ estimation (Fan et al., 2O14). However, this can also lead to significant errors when the water table is deeper, similarly to the $S _ { y }$ with DWT of $9 2 \ \mathrm { c m }$ in Figure 3. In addition, intense rainfall can cause air from the unsaturated zone to infiltrate into the saturated zone, leading to a rapid rise in the water table. This process is called the Lisse effect (Crosbie et al., 2OO5; Miyazaki et al., 2O12),which often causes the underestimation of $S _ { y }$ . However, in the study area, the Lisse effect was considered to be minimal, owing to the coastal soil texture.

# 3.3Groundwater recharge

For Obs1 and Obs2, groundwater recharge was estimated for 26 rainfall events during June 2017 to June 2O18. Groundwater recharge generally increased with the daily rainfallintensity (Fig. 4a). Therate of increaseslowed when rainfall exceeded $2 0 \ \mathrm { m m / d }$ and even decreased when rainfall was higher than $3 0 \ \mathrm { m m / d }$ at Obs2. This phenomenon was attributed to heavy rainfall exceeding the infiltration capacity of soil (Horton, 1933; Beven, 2004; Liu et al., 2011), or to the elevation of the water table to the land surface, leaving no space for infiltration (Sophocleous, 2OO2; Hoang et al., 2O17), with rainfall becoming surface runoff.

At the event scale, groundwater recharge was also affected by hourly rainfall intensity. For example, the rainfall amount was approximately 28.6 and $3 3 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ on 24 and 26 July 2017, respectively, however, the groundwater recharge on 26 July was much lower ( $1 3 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ than that on 24 July $( 2 3 . 9 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ at Ob2 (Fig. 4b). Although rainfall was heavier on 26 July, it mostly fell within $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ (approximately $2 1 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m m / h }$ ). In comparison to the prolonged rainfall on 24 July, the concentrated rainfall reduced groundwater recharge, as rainfall mainly became surface runoff. The relationship between rainfal intensity and groundwater recharge indicates that groundwater resources will decrease under the projected climate change, in which heavy rainfall events will increase with an overall reduction in rainfall frequency (Allen and Ingram, 2002).

Antecedent rainfall also affected groundwater recharge in some cases. For instance, groundwater recharge was approximately $6 . 9 \ \mathrm { m m / d }$ when the rainfall amount was $1 4 . 9 \ \mathrm { m m }$ on 18 June 2O17, while it reached $1 2 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ on 21 June 2O18 when the rainfall was slightly lower (13.1 $\mathrm { m m / d } )$ . It was found that the five-day cumulative rainfall was $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ for the first case and much lower than $1 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ for the latter event. The antecedent rainfall increased soil moisture, and subsequent rainfall replenished soil moisture and produced more recharge than the case in which the soil was dry and most infiltrated rainfall was retained in vadose zones (Zhang and Schilling, 2006).

In addition, groundwater was also determined by DWT as groundwater recharge at Obs2 was higher than that at Obs1, with a shallower water table in most cases (Fig. 4a). However, the relationship between groundwater recharge and DWT was nonlinear. For example, the total groundwater recharge during the study period was the highest at Obs2, corresponding to a mean DWT of $7 2 \mathrm { c m }$ in the rainy period, compared to that at the shallowest site (mean DWT, $3 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ at Obs1） or at the deepest site (mean DWT, $3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ at Obs3). It seems that both deeper and shallower water tables restrict groundwater recharge. In areas where the water table is close to the land surface, such as Obs1, rainfall mainly becomes surface runoff due to the saturation of the ground, instead of infiltration to groundwater (Gillham, 1984). At sites with thick unsaturated Zones, such as Obs3, the majority of rainfallinfiltration is consumed by evapotranspiration in the uppermost $2 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ of soil in semi-arid regions (Cook et al., 1989), and only a small portion reaches groundwater.

At the monthly scale, the temporal variations of groundwater recharge at Obs1 and Obs2 were similar and generally determined by the amount of rainfall (Fig. 4c). The greatest recharge

occurred in July 2O17, corresponding to the heaviest monthly rainfall of $9 4 . 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，while the lowest recharge occurred in September 2O17, when the monthly rainfall was as low as $1 6 . 6 \mathrm { m m }$ A linear equation with a positive slope can be used to describe the relationship between the monthly groundwater recharge and rainfall(Fig. 4d). Groundwater recharge was usually higher at Obs2 at a monthly scale than that at Obs1 (Fig. 4c), as the mean DWT for Obs1 and Obs2 was 21.0 and $6 1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ ， respectively. During the study period, total groundwater recharge was approximately $2 0 7 . 0 \ \mathrm {  m m }$ ，accounting for $52 \%$ of the rainfall at Obs1，while groundwater recharge was approximately 250.0 and $2 1 . 0 \mathrm { m m }$ at Obs2 and Obs3, respectively, accounting for $6 3 \%$ and $5 \%$ of rainfall, respectively.

Overall,the recharge rate of Obs2 was higher than those of Obs1 and Obs3, indicating that both shallower and deeper water tables can limit rainfall recharge. The soil texture of the unsaturated zone in Obs3 was also a major factor that decreased the recharge rate. Compared with Obsl and Obs2, similar recharge rates ( $5 3 \%$ and $62 \%$ ) were also found in the study by Crosbie et al. (2005) and Fan et al. (2O14) with similar soil textures and plants. Although the mean DWT (120.0 and $2 0 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ of their study areas was greater, the annual rainfall was almost four times higher than that at our study site. Therefore, a greater DWT does not decrease the rainfall infiltration in case of a high water content in the unsaturated zones.

# 3.4 Groundwater evapotranspiration

As no diurnal fluctuations were observed at Obs3 (Fig. 2a), hourly $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ (excluding rainy days), was estimated for Obsl and Obs2 only. The period from November 2017 to March 2018 was excluded because the $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ values were negligible due to plant dormancy (Yin et al., 2014). Therefore, $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ was calculated for $1 2 9 { \mathrm { ~ d ~ } }$ for Obs1 and $1 3 3 \mathrm { ~ d ~ }$ for Obs2. It was observed that $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ clearly varied diurnally. The mean $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ for each hour shows that $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ usually started increasing from 06:0O to a maximum of approximately $0 . 5 4 ~ \mathrm { m m / h }$ at 13:00 to 14:00, then decreased back to zero at 21:00 at Obs1 (Fig. 5). From 22:00 to 05:00 the next day, $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ was close to zero, indicating that there was no groundwater uptake during the night. Hourly $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ variations at Obs2 were similar to those at Obs1( $\scriptstyle ( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 1$ ， $P { < } 0 . 0 1 \rangle$ ， except that the peak values were lower (approximately $0 . 2 9 \mathrm { m m / h } \rangle$ and the duration of the peak was longer (approximately $4 \mathrm { h }$ versus $2 \mathrm { h }$ at Obs1) (Fig. 5). During daytime, the standard deviation (SD) of $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ increased with time, reaching a peak value at 13:OO,and then decreased. For example, SD increased from $0 . 0 5 ~ \mathrm { m m / h }$ at 06:00 to $0 . 2 7 ~ \mathrm { m m / h }$ at 13:OO, and decreased nearly to $0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m m / h }$ at 21:00 at Obs1.

Fig.5Mean hourly $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ (groundwater evapotranspiration) at Obs1 (a) and Obs2 (b)

Daily $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ patterns suggested that it started to increase around mid-April when plants began to grow and became nearly zero in mid-October when they entered winter dormancy (Fig. 6), with good agreement on daily sap flow variations in the Mu Us Sandy Land of China (Yin et al., 2014). At a daily scale, $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at Obs1 ranged from 0.3 to $8 . 7 \mathrm { m m / d }$ , with a mean value of $4 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m / d }$ ，while at Obs2 it varied between O.1 and $7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m m / d }$ ，with a mean value of $2 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m / d }$ .It should be noted that $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at Obsl and Obs2 was in line with other grass-covered areas, where it is reported to be in the range of $1 . 0 { - } 4 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m / d }$ (Nachabe et al., 2005; Schilling, 2007; Lautz, 2008; Gribovszki et al.,

2017). Meteorological conditions were the main factors affecting the fluctuations in daily $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ The correlation analysis revealed that net radiation and vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity were positively and negatively related to $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ , respectively (Fig. 7a, b and c). However, there was no correlation between $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ and wind speed (Fig. 7d). The most influential meteorological factors on $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ were net radiation, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and wind speed.

Although hourly and daily $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at Obs1 and Obs2 exhibited similar temporal variations, the magnitudes were substantially diferent (Figs. 5 and 6). It was hypothesized that DWT, the main difference between the two sites, caused this difference. To explore the impact of DWT on $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ we introduced the ratio of $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ to $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ ，as meteorological conditions also affect $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ in shallow water table conditions, as shown in Figure 7 and other studies (Butler et al., 2OO7; Carlson Mazur et al., 2014; Shanafield et al., 2017). $\mathrm { E T _ { g } / E T _ { 0 } }$ gradually decreased with DWT and an exponential equation was used to fit this decay (Fig. 8a), which is consistent with field observations (Nichols, 1994; Cooper et al., 2006; Elmore et al., 2006; Pritchett and Manning, 2012; Ma et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017) and numerical modeling (Shah et al., 2007; Soylu et al., 2012). It is predicted that, based on an extrapolation using the fitted equation, $\mathrm { E T _ { g } / E T _ { 0 } }$ will drop to 0.005 when the water table decreases to $3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ， The depth corresponding to an $\mathrm { E T _ { g } / E T _ { 0 } }$ value below 0.005 is defined as the extinction depth (Shah et al., 2OO7)，which is a key parameter for quantifying regional evapotranspiration. The extinction depth of the study site was approximately $3 . 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ， explained by the absence of diurnal fluctuations at Obs3, where the mean DWT was approximately $3 . 5 \mathrm { { m } }$

The monthly $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ was obtained by summing daily values. On a monthly scale, $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ ranged from $1 2 5 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ in June 2018 to $4 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ in April 2018, with a mean value of $6 7 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ at Obs1, while $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ ranged from $9 4 . 0 \mathrm { m m }$ in May 2018 to $8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in October 2017, with a mean value of $4 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ at Obs2. The coefficient of determination $( R ^ { 2 } )$ between $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ and $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ at Obs1 was 0.94, which was higher than that at Obs2 ( $( R ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 2 9 )$ ， indicating that $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at Obs1 was mainly determined by meteorological conditions. $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at Obs2 was also controlled by DWT, as indicated by the lower values in July 2O17 and June 2O18, when the water table was at its lowest (Figs. 2a and 8b), although $\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ in those times was higher than that during the neighboring months (Fig. 8b). The monthly variations in $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ suggested that $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ was determined by the DWT and meteorological conditions.

Over the hydrological year studied, the groundwater consumption at Obs1 was approximately $5 3 9 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ， which was 1.6 times the annual rainfall. At Obs2 it was approximately $3 3 6 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ， equivalent to O.9 times the annual rainfall, indicating strong groundwater uptake by $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ in shallow water table areas. In shallow water table environments, $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ can significantly exceed rainfall, as shown in this and previous studies. For example, in a playa in arid central Australia, annual $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ loss is as high as annual rainfall (Shanafield et al., 2O15). In the riparian zones of the Middle Rio Grande River, the estimated $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ is even higher, approximately four times the annual rainfall (Soylu et al., 2012).

Additionally, the variation patterns of rainfall recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ were only analyzed for one hydrological year because of limited monitoring data. In the future, the interannual variations of rainfall recharge and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ and their determining factors should be explored.

# 4Conclusions

In this study, WTFs in three observation wells along a cross-sectional area were observed over a hydrological year, in a semi-arid lake wetland in the Ordos Plateau, China. The data were analyzed to estimate groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration using a depth-dependent specific yield. A rapid water table response to rainfall was observed for two shallow wells (i.e., Obs1 and Obs2),at which diurnal WTFs were also observed over most of the study period. This indicated that the most influential factors of variations in water table level are rainfall and $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ However, at the deeper water table site (Obs3), the groundwater table only reacted to extremely heavy rainfall and showed no diurnal variations.

Over the study period, the annual groundwater recharge was 2O7.0, 250.0, and $2 1 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ accounting for $52 \%$ ， $6 3 \%$ ，and $5 \%$ of rainfall at Obs1, Obs2,and Obs3, respectively. It was found that rainfall intensity is one of the main determining factors for rainfall infiltration, as groundwater recharge increases with rainfall intensity at daily and monthly scales, and the rate of increase of daily groundwater recharge slowed down when rainfall exceeded $2 0 { - } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { m m / d }$ , due to surface runoff. In addition, DWT was also a major factor influencing groundwater recharge, according to the recharge rate of the three observation wells in this study.

Hourly $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ showed that groundwater consumption occurred mainly during the daytime, and nighttime $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ was negligible. The daily mean $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ at Obs1 and Obs2 were 4.3 and $2 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ respectively, over the entire hydrological year. The variations in $\mathrm { E T _ { g } }$ were mainly attributed to the DWT and net radiation in the study area.
