The functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)by ozone treatment has been systematically investigated by using Raman spectroscopy,transmission electron microscopy(TEM),Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),organic elemental analysis (OEA)and Boehm titration.The results showed that the functionalization process occurred atdefective sites(opened mouths,tube caps,debris,etc.) before opening caps and truncating walls,and finally the graphitic structure was deteriorated.The surface oxygen content first increased with the treatment time but kept at around $8 . 0 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ after $^ { 5 \mathrm { h } }$ 、The analysis of the distribution of oxygen-containing groups revealed that phenolic hydroxyl was gradually converted to carboxyl and lactone.The carboxyl was found to play a pivotal role to reduce the over-potentials when we used the functionalized MWCNTs as the catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

# 1.Introduction

Carbon nanotubes(CNTs） have attracted tremendous interests due to their wide applications in many fields such as catalysis,fuel cells,composite materials,electric devices,and so on[1,2l.However, the surface inertness of pristine CNTs leads to inferior dispersion inthe matrixand weak interaction forceat the interface,which essentially limits the large-scale applications of CNTs.The oxygen functionalities(ketonic carbonyl, lactone,phenolic hydroxyl,carboxyl,etc.）can endow CNTs with hydrophilicity to disperse in solvents and chemical reactivity for catalytic reactions[1.3l.Liquidphase oxidation is often employed by refluxing or immersing CNTs in many strong corrosive reagents like $\mathsf { H N O } _ { 3 }$ 5 $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ ， $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { K M n O } _ { 4 } ^ { [ 4 ] }$ ,inducing the production of noxious gases and waste chemicals.On the contrary, gas-phase oxidation is much cleaner and more convenient[5l. Among all oxidative gases,ozone takes several unique advantages including easyaccessibility from ozone generator, low capital costand sustainability.Most importantly, the functionalization can be conducted even at room temperature due to the superior reactivity of ozone.Ultraviolet[6l and ultrasound[7l are capable to improve the efficiency of functionalization.

In order to control the distribution of oxygen functionalities on CNTs for a specific use,many researchers have made great efforts to clarify the reaction mechanism between CNTs and ozone.Lu etal. have predicted that ozone added to the double bonds of CNTs in an analogous way to that of alkenes and fullerenes through 1,3- dipolar cycloaddition reaction following the Criegee mechanism[8l. The primary ozonide as a proposed intermediate was unstable and might readily dissociate into carbonyl and epoxidel9.1ol. Chiang et al. suggested that the intermediate was hydrotrioxide that could transform into $\scriptstyle { C = 0 }$ double bonds,peroxides or oxygen radicals before the formation of carboxyl and carbonyll1l.The existence of peroxide intermediate was verified by Razumovskii et al.by using the electron spin resonance techniquel1ol. In contrast,Li et al.[7l revealed that the $C = C$ double bonds were first converted to $- C { \mathrm { - O H } }$ and further oxidized to $- C = 0$ and ${ \sf O } = { \sf C } - { \sf O H }$ ,which was confirmed later by Vennerberg et al.[12].

Most recently,we found that the carboxylic groups were apt to playa determined role in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),which was technically important for electrochemical devices and electrolysis processesl13l. We present here a systematic study on the ozone-mediated functionalization of MWCNTs byusing various techniques including Raman spectroscopy,transmission electron microscopy(TEM),Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),organic elemental analysis（OEA) and Boehm titration. One mechanism will be proposed to describe both surface and bulk changes of MWCNTs in a flow of diluted ozone at room temperature.Additionally, the catalytic role of the carboxyl for ORR was further verified.

# 2.Experimental

The pristine MWCNTs (purity 97.5 wt. $\%$ ,average diameter $1 2 . 9 \ : \mathrm { n m }$ , length $3 \mathrm { - } 1 2 \mu \mathrm { m } \dot { }$ ）were supplied by Shandong Dazhan Nanomaterials Co.,Ltd., China,which were prepared by chemical vapor deposition.A flow of diluted ozone was generated under an ozone generator (WH-H-Y,Wohuan ozone Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Co., China) using pure oxygen as the gas source. $\mathsf { N a O H }$ ${ \bf N a } _ { 2 } { \bf C O } _ { 3 }$ and ${ \mathsf { N a H C O } } _ { 3 }$ were analytical grade reagents (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). $_ { 2 \mathrm { g } }$ pristine MWCNTs were placed in a quartz U-type reactor and treated in $0 . 5 \mathrm { L } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ of diluted ozone $( 3 . 6 ~ \mathrm { v o l . \% ~ O _ { 3 } } )$ ）at room temperature for different reaction times ranging from 0.25 to $^ { 9 \mathrm { h } }$

The Raman spectra were collected with a Renishaw inViareflex spectrometer using back-scattered light froma $5 3 2 \mathrm { n m }$ laser focused througha $5 0 \times$ objective lens.TEMimageswererecorded by usinga Tecnai F2O microscope(FEI) with an acceleration voltage of $2 0 0 \mathrm { k V } .$ The infrared spectra were obtained by using Nicolet 6700 with samples dispersed and gently grinded the powder in KBr.The overall oxygen content of each sample was determined by an organic element analyzer (HORIBA EMGA-62OW).XPS tests were performed on an AXIS Ultra DLD multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectroscope with an Al Kα radiation source undera vacuum of $1 0 ^ { - 9 }$ Torr.The starting angel of the photoelectron was set at $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ ,and the spectrum was calibrated with a $\mathsf { C } _ { 1 s }$ spectrum of $2 8 4 . 6 \mathrm { e V } .$

Boehm titration is an effective method to quantify the concentrations of oxygen functionalities including carboxyl,phenolic hydroxyl and lactone.Briefly, the sample $( \sim 0 . 5 \ : \mathrm { g } )$ was stirred for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ in threedifferent $2 5 \mathrm { m L } 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m o l } \mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ basic solutions of NaOH, $\mathsf { N a } _ { 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 3 }$ and ${ \mathsf { N a H C O } } _ { 3 }$ ,respectively.After filtering,the filtrate Was titrated by $_ { = } 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m o l } \mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ hydrochloric acid with degassing of pure ${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ for complete $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ expulsion during the titration.The pH variety was recorded bya digital pH meter,and the endpoint was determined from the first derivative of the pH-volume plot.The concentrations of oxygen functionalities were calculated based on the following assumptions:NaOH can neutralize lactone,carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl.

$\mathsf { N a } _ { 2 } \mathsf { C O } _ { 3 }$ can neutralize both lactone and carboxyl,while ${ \mathsf { N a H C O } } _ { 3 }$ could merely neutralize the carboxyl.The difference between the uptakes of the bases can be used to quantify a specific functionality.

All electrochemical tests were carried out with a $\mathrm { C H I 7 6 0 E }$ electrochemistry workstation (Shanghai CH Instruments,China) and a conventional three-electrode test cell at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ A glassy carbon disk coated with catalyst was used as the working electrode.The counterelectrode and reference-electrode were a graphitic rod and a $3 \mathrm { { M } }$ $\mathsf { A g / A g C l }$ ，respectively.The glassy carbon disk was polished with $3 0 \mathrm { n m }$ alumina powder,sonicated and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol before used.The homogeneous catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the mixture of $1 \mathrm { m g }$ catalyst, $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L } \mathsf { H } _ { 2 } 0$ $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ acetone and $5 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ Nafion alcohol solution (DuPont, 5 wt% Nafion) for 15 min. ${ 5 } \mu \mathrm { L }$ catalyst ink was subsequently pipetted out and spread on a $3 \mathrm { m m }$ -diametercleaned glassycarbon diskas the working electrode with the areal loading amount of $1 4 1 . 5 \mu \mathrm { g }$ $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ MWCNTs.To evaluate the catalytic activity for ORR,the cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out in $0 . 1 \mathrm { m o l } \mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 } .$ $\mathrm {  ~ \ s l ~ L ^ { - 1 } ~ K O H }$ solution saturated with 20 sccm ultrapure $0 _ { 2 }$ at a scanning rate of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m V } s ^ { - 1 }$

# 3.Results and Discussion

Raman spectroscopy is a common method to characterize the structure changes of carbon materialsl14,15l. Fig.1(a) presents the Raman spectra of pristine and treated MWCNTs,in which two prominent peaks centering at 1344 and $1 5 7 5 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ can be assigned to the defect-induced disorder $( D )$ mode and graphite(G) mode,respectively. The $D$ to $G$ intensity ratio,e.g. $R = I _ { \mathrm { D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } }$ ,could reflect the structural amorphization of MWCNTs.The dependencies of $R$ value and weight loss on the treatment time are depicted in Fig.1(b)and 1(c).The weight loss almost linearly increased with the treatment time,while the tendency of $R$ value comprised three stages.In the initial $^ { 3 \mathrm { h } }$ ,the $R$ value slightly increased from1.11 to 1.13,while the weight loss graduallyapproached to $1 0 . 7 \%$ .Then,asharp rise in $R$ valuewas observed at $^ { 5 \mathrm { h } }$ and the value reached 1.34,being $2 1 \%$ higher than that of the pristine sample,but the weight loss of MWCNTs gradually increased with the treatment time without any abrupt change.Finally,as the treatment time being extended to $^ { 9 \mathrm { h } }$ the $R$ value slowly wentup from 1.34 to 1.38.

To make clear the changes in structural and surface properties, we characterized all samples by TEM,FTIR,and XPS.Fig.2 shows the representative TEM and high-resolution TEM images of pristine and treated MWCNTs.Before the contact with ozone,the pristine MWCNTs (Fig.2(a)) possessed intact tube structure with closed caps, and with some residual amorphous carbons attaching to the outer walls.After being oxidized for $3 \mathrm { h }$ ,as displayed in Fig.2(b),the amorphous species were burnt off.The outer walls ofMWCNTs became clean and smooth with etched caps,while the inner walls were free of obvious change.With increasing the treatment time,the caps were thoroughly opened and the graphitic walls were etched to some extent (Fig.2(c)).The nanotubes were truncated or shortened to result in a dramatic increase of $R$ value (Fig.1(b)).

Ozone treatment also introduced various oxygen functionalities on MWCNTs.The FTIR spectra of Fig.3 indicated the presence of some oxygen functionalities such as carboxylic acids,ester and quinoneli6]. The oxygen contents of all samples were determined by OEA and XPS as shown in Fig.4(a). Note that XPS is a common surface technique to obtain the distribution of the surface oxygen (surf-O) species on the outer walls of MWCNTs,whereas OEA gives the overall oxygen (over-O) content. Both surf-O and over-O got a sudden increase during the initial $0 . 2 5 \mathrm { h }$ treatment and then the increase slowed down.Subsequently,the over-O content almost linearlyapproached to $9 . 0 8 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ after treating for $^ { 9 \mathrm { h } }$ Differently, the surf-O content increased sharply after $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ treatment.But a decrease of surf-O content was observed after treating for $^ { 5 \mathrm { h } }$ It was noted that the great increase of the surf-O content coincided exactly with the abrupt change of R value in Raman analysis (Fig.1(b)),suggesting that the oxygen functionalization approached exactly with the oxidative etching.The concentrations of carboxyl,phenolic hydroxyl and lactone were quantified by Boehm titration (Fig.4(b,c). To evaluate the possible disturbance of the residual metal catalyst particles contained in the CNTs framework,we first used ICP-OES to analyze the amount of metal ions in the titration solution.The maximum amount of Fe ions was below $2 . 0 \mu \mathrm { m o l } \mu \mathrm { C N T s } ^ { - 1 }$ ,givinga negligible influence on the calculation of the oxygen functional groups. The concentrations of carboxyl and lactone gradually increased with treatment time,while that of phenolic hydroxyl kept almost unchanged.However, the distributions of oxygen functionalities in Fig.4(c) showed that the fraction of the phenolic hydroxyl significantly decreased,but that of the carboxyl increased with the treatment time.The phenolic hydroxyl was prevailing at the initial stage but subsequently declined to $1 9 . 8 \%$ at $^ { 9 \mathrm { h } }$ .While the proportion of the carboxyl showedan opposite tendencyand finally reached $5 5 . 7 \%$ This evidence suggested that the phenolic hydroxyl was most possibly oxidized into the carboxyl under the atmosphere of ozone,which could be further verified by the XPS analysis in Fig.4(d).The insert pattern revealed that the $0 _ { 1 s }$ spectrum could be deconvoluted into two species,being assigned to $\scriptstyle { C = 0 }$ and $C { - } 0$ components that centered at $( 5 3 1 . 8 \pm 0 . 2 )$ eV and $( 5 3 3 . 4 \pm 0 . 2 )$ eV,respectivelyl3l. The intensity ratio of $\mathsf { C } = 0$ and $C - 0$ $I _ { \mathrm { C = 0 } } / I _ { \mathrm { C } } - _ { 0 } .$ ,was found to greatly increase at the initial period and gradually rise with the treatment time,coinciding with the result revealed by Boehm analysis (Fig.4(c)). The oxidative conversion of the phenolic hydroxyl into carboxyl was also observed elsewherel7,12,17].

in which the yellow location represents the formed oxygen functionalities.

Based on the above results,we proposed a three-stage mechanism of ${ { 0 } _ { 3 } }$ -mediate functionalization of MWCNTs(Scheme1).At the initial stage,the oxidation process occurred at the surface active sitesincluding caps and defects of MWCNTs,which were of high electron density, thus preferentially reacted with ozone[18l.Later, caps and walls comprising a large amount of structural defects were etched by ozone molecules,which were triggered by the -0011 functionalization at the first stage.Simultaneously,more carbon atoms exposed to ozone and functionalized by active oxygen atoms, significantly enhancing the oxygen contents especially the surf-O. The opened tips and penetrated walls of MWCNTs could also facilitate the inner surface to be accessible to ozone.As a result, the functionalization on the inner surface was prevailing at the third stage,which was evidenced by the difference between surf-O and over-O contents.Since the oxygen species on the inner surface were difficult to be detected by XPS,the obtained surf-O content did not increase like that of over-O.Inversely,due to the deeper oxidation of MWCNTs surfaces by ozone,some oxygen functionalities were oxidized into $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ ,leading toa decreased surf-O content (Fig.4(a)) after $5 \mathrm { h } .$ Another fact was that the etching at the second stage proceeded along the radial direction rather than the axial one,because the formed destructive zones were apt to suppress the reactivity of the adjacent atoms on the surface and thus prevented them burning off[10].

Our previous work[19l has proposed that the carboxylic groups on MWCNTs played a pivotal role in the electrocatalytic ORR reaction.So we employed this reaction as a probe reaction to investigate the catalytic properties of ${ { 0 } _ { 3 } }$ -mediated functionalized MwCNTs by the cyclic voltammetry(CV)method in $0 . 1 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ KOH solution that was saturated with ${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ or $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ .Under ${ \sf N } _ { 2 }$ sweeping (Fig. 5(a)), the functionalized MWCNTsafter treated for $^ { 9 \mathrm { h } }$ displayeda significantly increased CVarea,indicating that the functionalization efficiently improved the capacitance of MWCNTs.The featureless CV curves of samples suggested the absence of metal impurities on the MWCNTs surfacel20l. After switching the sweep gas,a notable signal peak attributed to ORR was observed in Fig.5(b).The ORR onset potential was determined from the intersection of the two tangents drown at the rising current and the background current density of the CV curvesl21l,while the ORR activity was defined as the absolute current density obtained by subtracting the corresponding background value from the peak value.The functionalized MWCNTs displayed a clear ORR peak potential at $- 0 . 2 5 2 \mathrm { V }$ VS $\mathsf { A g / A g C l }$ with $- 1 . 7 7 2 \mathrm { m A c m ^ { - 2 } }$ of current density,while the pristine MWCNTs exhibited a more negative peak potential at -0.356V vs Ag/AgCl with the current density at $- 1 . 1 9 3 \mathrm { m A c m ^ { - 2 } }$ .Such an outstanding performance is comparable to or even higher than those of some nitrogen and phosphorus doped carbon materials[22,23l. The CV tests in $0 _ { 2 }$ saturated electrolyte verified that the ${ { 0 } _ { 3 } }$ 1 mediated functionalization played an important role in enhancing the ORRactivityofMWCNTs,which was further evidenced bythe correlation of CV onset and peak potentials with the concentrations of oxygen functionalities.The linearregressionanalysiswas performed for the structure-activity relationship between ORR potentials and the concentration of carboxyl,phenolic hydroxyl as well aslactone.As a result,only the carboxyl showed a much closer correlation with ORR potentials than the other oxygen-containing groups.Fig.5(c) revealed a direct decline in the ORR over-potentials (the absolute values of CV onset and peak potentials) with the increasing concentration of carboxyl,which matched very well with our previous investigation[19]. Nonetheless,the ORR current density appeared a distinct different trend with the increasing concentration of carboxyl.As seen in Fig. 5(d),the $\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ treatment overall improved the catalytic activity of MWCNTs with a higher ORR current density than the pristine sample.It could be explained that the attack of ${ { 0 } _ { 3 } }$ resulted ina carboxyl modified carbon surface and more defective graphitic structure to active oxygen molecules.Additionally, the exposed oxygen functionalities enhanced the hydrophilicity of MWCNTs,which strengthened the affinity between electrolyte and oxygen,and consequential oxygen diffusion to the catalyst surfacel24l. Wu et al.[25l confirmed that the presence of surface oxygen groups wasnecessary for the ORR activity rather than the edge defects in $s p ^ { 3 }$ configuration.Tian et al.26l also proposed the fully exposed active sites can effectively catalyze the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction.However, the modification of oxygen-containing groups and $\phantom { + } | _ { 0 _ { 3 } }$ etching to graphitic lattice gave rise to an obvious reduction of electrical conductivity of MWCNTs,ora more difficult electron transport in carbon frameworks[27l. It was therefore well understood that the most active catalyst was the $\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ -modifiedMWCNTstreatedat 1 h with moderate carboxylic concentration of O.2 mmol $\mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ .We furtherchecked the ORRdurability of the functionalized MWCNTs catalyst(9 h) in oxygen saturated $0 . 1 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ KOH solution at the scanning rate of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m V } s ^ { - 1 }$ (Fig.6).The catalyst exhibited a slight declined activity witha current retention of $9 1 . 5 \%$ evenafter10 000 cycles (about $7 1 . 5 \mathrm { h }$ ).Simultaneously, the inserted CV curves in Fig. 6 showa tiny negative shift of potential from $- 0 . 2 5 2 \mathrm { V }$ VS $\mathsf { A g / A g C l }$ to $- 0 . 2 7 5 \mathrm { \Delta V }$ VS $\mathsf { A g / A g C l }$ .Given all the above electrochemical analysis, the ${ { 0 } _ { 3 } }$ treatment predicts a promising method to achieve active and stable carbon materials for ORR application.

# 4.Conclusion

The ${ { 0 } _ { 3 } }$ -mediated functionalization mechanismofMWCNTs and the catalytic performance of functionalized MWCNTs in the

ORR reaction were systematically investigated.The interaction process probably undergoes three stages,which comprises the functionalization of carbons at the surface sites like caps and defects, further etching of curved caps and defective walls by ${ { 0 } _ { 3 } }$ to open tipsand penetrate walls,and the functionalization of the inner and fractured surfaces.The phenolic hydroxyl was initially formed and then gradually oxidized into carboxyl as well as lactone.The carboxyl was found to playa pivotal role to reduce the ORR overpotentials and therefore improve the electrocatalytic activity of MWCNTs.However,the excess amount of oxygen-containing groups would obstruct the electron transport and consequently perform lowcurrent densities.The ORRactivity of MWCNTs can be dramatically improved by realizing an appropriate functionalization extent and a prevailing fraction of carboxyl.
