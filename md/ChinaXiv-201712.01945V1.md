Abstract

In this work, the resistivity and magnetization of BizIr2O $^ 7$ are investigated under hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure,the resistivity of BizIr2O $7$ exhibits a metallic behavior with the decrease of temperature. When the pressure is applied,a metal-insulator phase transition at low temperature is induced under a pressure of $\sim 0 . 4 8$ GPa.The metal-insulator phase transition temperature ( $T _ { M I }$ ) increases linearly with pressure as $\mathrm { d } T _ { M I } / \mathrm { d } P = 3 . 4 \pm 0 . 3 \ \mathrm { ~ . ~ }$ K/GPa. The temperature dependence of resistivity $[ \rho ( T ) ]$ in the pressure-induced insulating phase exhibits a thermal activation behavior ( $\rho = \rho _ { 0 } e ^ { \Delta E / k _ { B } T } )$ , where the thermal activation energy $( \Delta E )$ increases monotonously with the pressure. Meanwhile,the magnetization is enhanced by the pressure, which indicates an enhancement of magnetic ordering. The results suggest that localization occurs due to the magnetic ordering induced by the pressure, which confirms the magneto-electronic coupling in BizIr2O $^ 7$

# I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, the pyrochlore iridates AzIr $^ 2$ O $^ 7$ （A = lanthanide,yttrium，or bismuth） have been paid significant attention due to the prominent physical phenomena rang form spin liquid states, spin ice, field-induced spin quantum transition, to possible topological nontrivial state [1-9]. These exotic phenomena originate from the multiple interplays involving spin, orbit, charge,and lattice degrees of freedom, such as the efective spin $J = 1 / 2$ magnetic moments of Ir-5d electrons caused by the strong spin-orbital coupling, the geometrical frustration produced by the corner-sharing tetrahedra, the large crystal field resulted from the octahedron [9, 10]. The cell of pyrochlore A2Ir $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ is cubic structure belonging to $F d \overline { { 3 } } m$ space group [11], the structure of which is usually described as two interpenetrating networks of A $_ 2$ O,and BO $^ 6$ ， whose vertices are occupied by spins leading to strong geometrical frustration [12, 13]. As we know, the iridium-based pyrochlore oxides are prototypical materials with more extended $5 d$ orbits, which prone to form much strong spin-orbital coupling compared with those in $3 d$ transition-metal oxides [10]. The strong spin-orbital coupling and electron-lattice coupling rise the orbital degeneracy and narrow the bandwidths of $5 d$ （204号 orbits,which lead iridium-based systems near a bandwidth-controlled metal-insulator transition (MIT) [10,14]. Actually, most of AIr $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ oxides undergo an MIT except Pr2Ir2O $^ 7$ and Bi2Ir $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ which keep paramagnetic metallic behavior down to low temperature [8, 15,16]. Moreover, the MIT occurs concomitantly with a transition to an all-in/al-out (AIAO) magnetic ordering state [5,17].

In the pyrochlore oxides,BizIr $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ is special and prominent due to its metallic behavior down to very low temperature and lack of long-range magnetic ordering [18, 19]. The Bi $^ { 3 + }$ （204号 ions on A-sites are biggest among the A2Ir $_ 2$ O $7$ compounds. However,its lattice lies between that of EuzIr $_ 2$ O $7$ and NdzIr $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ . Recent study on BizIr $_ 2$ O $7$ uncovers unconventional physical properties at very low temperature [16]. Moreover, the muon spin relaxation ( $\mu$ SR) reveals two weak magnetic transitions at 1.84 K and 0.23 K respectively at low temperature, which shows up an exotic ground state in B $^ { \cdot 2 }$ h $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ [19].

Although many studies on this compound, the nature of the transport and weak magnetic properties in BizIr $_ 2$ O $7$ are still not completely clarified. A bandwidth-controlled MIT is expected despite of metallic behavior in BizIr $_ 2$ O $7$ . As we know, the hydrostatic pressure is a pure method to drive more dramatic changes in various physical parameters, such as electron correlations, magnetic interactions,and bandwidths [2O-23]. In this work, the resistivity and magnetization of BizIr $_ 2$ O $7$ are investigated under hydrostatic pressure. When a pressure is applied,an insulating phase at low temperature is induced under a pressure of $\sim ~ 0 . 4 8$ （204 GPa. The transition temperature ( $T _ { M I }$ ） increases linearly with pressure as $\mathrm { d } T _ { M I } / \mathrm { d } P = 3 . 4$ （20 （204号 $\pm$ 0.3 K/GPa. Moreover, the magnetization is increased by the pressure, which suggests the enhancement of magnetic ordering induces the MIT in BizIr2O $^ 7$ ：

# II. EXPERIMENT

A polycrystalline sample of BizIr $^ 2$ O $7$ was synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The starting materials, powders of Bi $_ 2$ O $^ 3$ (purity 99.9 $\%$ ）and IrO $_ 2$ (99.99 $\%$ ）were mixed thoroughly according to the stoichiometric ratio of $1 : 2$ . The mixed powders were sintered at 1173 K for 4 days with several intermediate grindings. The structure and phase purity were checked by the Rigaku-TTR 3 X-ray diffractometer with high-intensity graphite monochromatized Cu K $\alpha$ radiation. The resistivity measurements were performed using the conventional four-probe method with the temperature varied using a closed-cycle helium refrigeration unit. The DC magnetization was measured by a Magnetic Property Measurement System (Quantum Design MPMS 7 T-XL) with a superconductive quantum interference device (SQUID). The hydrostatic high-pressure was realized by using a clamp-type piston pressure cell, where Daphne 7373 oil was employed as the medium to transmit pressure with a high level of high homogeneity. To calibrate the pressures at room temperature, we used Cu $^ { 2 }$ O powder as a manometer, whose nuclear quadrupole resonance frequency as a function of pressure has been determined very accurately [24].

# III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 1 depicts the temperature dependence of resistivity $[ \rho ( T ) ]$ for BizIr $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ under selected pressures up to 2.24 GPa,where the inset shows that under ambient pressure on log-log scale. As we know, physical behaviors of A $^ 2$ h $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ systems correlate closely with the ionic radius of $\mathrm { A ^ { 3 + } }$ ions,which influences the bandwidth of Ir- $5 d$ band by changing the Ir-OIr bond angle [4, 14, 22]. The ionic radius of Bi $^ { 3 + }$ (1.17 A) is the biggest compared with the lanthanide or yttrium among AzIr $_ 2$ O $7$ systems [25]. However, BizIr $_ 2$ O $7$ lies between Eu2Ir2O $^ 7$ and Nd2Ir $^ 2$ ○ $^ 7$ in terms of its lattice constant [26]. Moreover, the $6 p$ orbit of $\mathrm { B i ^ { 3 + } }$ situates at near the Fermi level and hybridizes strongly with the Ir- $5 d$ bands, which expands the （202 $5 d$ bandwidth of $\mathrm { I r ^ { 4 + } }$ [27]. Therefore, a metallic behavior is expected for BizIr $^ 2$ O $^ 7$ [27, 28]. Under ambient pressure as given in the inset of Fig. 1, the $\rho ( T )$ curve of BizIr $_ 2$ O $7$ indeed exhibits a metallic behavior with $d \rho / d T > 0$ in the whole measurement temperature range, which is in agreement with the theoretic prediction and previous reports [16,18].

It is well know that the electronic correlation in AzIr $_ 2$ ○ $7$ can be manipulated by ionic radius on A-sites through the modulation of bond length and bond angle [14]. Actually, it has been demonstrated that the modulation of A-ions by chemical doping of Y or Ca does induce phase transitions at low temperature in BizIr $^ 2$ O $^ 7$ [29,30]. However，the chemical doping inevitably brings in disorders and defects, which will significantly afect the transport behavior in the system. On the other hand, the hydrostatic pressure is known as a pure device compared with the chemical doping，which can effectively modulate electron correlations, magnetic interactions,and bandwidths. In addition, it has been demonstrated that pressure below $\sim 2 . 4$ GPa does not destroy the lattice symmetry of A2Ir $^ 2$ O $^ 7$ [20]. Thus, the change of properties below $\sim 2 . 4$ GPa is only caused by the change of bond length and bond angle. In view of this, hydrostatic pressures up to 2.24 GPa are applied to BizIr $_ 2$ ○ $7$ . When the pressure is applied,all $\rho ( T )$ curves under different pressures for BizIr $^ 2$ O $7$ exhibit similar behaviors,as shown in the main panel of Fig. 1. However, in addition to the raise and lowering of $\rho ( T )$ curves by the pressure, tiny changes occurs to $\rho ( T )$ curves， especially in low temperature range.

In order to clearly clarified the influence of pressure on the resistivity of BizIrzO $7$ ,the $\rho ( T )$ curves in low temperature range below 30 K are magnified, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Under ambient pressure, the $\rho ( T )$ presents a metallic behavior down to 4 K, except a tiny rise at low temperature. In fact， study shows that Bi $^ { \cdot 2 }$ h $_ 2$ O $7$ exhibits a metallic behavior down to 2 K without any phase transition [19]. When the pressure is applied, changes happen to the $\rho ( T )$ curve. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the $\rho ( T )$ curve under $P = 0 . 1 6$ GPa still keeps a metalic behavior down to 4 K, which is analogy to that under ambient pressure. However, the a upturn occurs to $\rho ( T )$ curve under $P = 0 . 4 8$ GPa,where the slope of $\rho ( T )$ changes from positive $( d \rho / d T > 0 ) _ { , }$ ）to negative ( $g _ { \rho } / d T < 0 _ { , }$ ） with the decrease of temperature. As the pressure further increases, the region of $d \rho / d T < 0$ expands. Generally， positive $d \rho / d T$ suggests a metalic behavior, while negative $d \rho / d T$ indicates an insulating one [22].

Therefore, the change of $d \rho / d T$ form positive to negative induced by the pressure gives a clue of a pressure-induced MIT.

The MIT temperature ( $T _ { M I }$ ) can be quantified by the minimum point of $\rho ( T )$ , as indicated by the triangles in Fig. 2 (a). Figure 3 (a) plots the $T _ { M I }$ vs. $P$ extracted from Fig. 2 (a). As can be seen, the MIT appears above $P \sim 0 . 4 8$ GPa. The $T _ { M I }$ depends linearly on the pressure up to 2.24 GPa. As mentioned above, pressure below $\sim 2 . 4$ GPa does not destroy the lattice symmetry of A2IrO $^ 7$ [20].Thus,the linear dependence of $T _ { M I }$ on $P$ confirms that the pressure has linear effect on the transport properties of BizIr $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ . The linear fitting of $T _ { M I }$ vs. $P$ gives that $\mathrm { d } T _ { M I } / \mathrm { d } P = 3 . 4 \pm 0 . 3$ GPa/K and the intercept $I = 7 . 7 \pm 0 . 4$ （20 K. The increase of $T _ { M I }$ with the increase of $P$ suggests a positive pressure effect. In fact, in the AzIr2O $^ { 7 }$ system，Gd2Ir2O $^ 7$ and EuzIr $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ also exhibit positive pressure effects with （20 $\mathrm { d } T _ { M I } / \mathrm { d } P = 6 . 2 \pm 0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { G P }$ a/K and $3 . 5 \pm 0 . 2$ GPa/K respectively [31]. In contrary, Sm $^ { 2 }$ h $^ 2$ O $7$ （204 displays a negative pressure effect with $\mathrm { d } T _ { M I } / \mathrm { d } P = - 1 3 . 2 \pm 0 . 8$ GPa/K [31]. In addition, Nd2Ir $_ 2$ O $7$ present a negative pressure effect [23]. Thus,it can be seen that pressure effects in AzIr2O $^ 7$ exhibit various tendencies,which indicates complex correlation and interactions in these systems.

Generally, for the gapped insulating system, its resistivity usually follows the thermally activated exponential behavior called Arrhenius's law:

$$
\rho = \rho _ { 0 } e ^ { \Delta E / k _ { B } T }
$$

Where $\rho _ { 0 }$ represents the residual resistivity, $\Delta E$ is the activation energy, and $k _ { B }$ is the Boltzmann constant. According to the Arrhenius's law, the $\mathrm { l n } \rho$ depends linearly on $T ^ { - 1 }$ Figure 2(b） gives the $\mathrm { l n } \rho$ vs. $T ^ { - 1 }$ at low temperatures under different pressures. It can be seen that the $\mathrm { l n } \rho$ vs. $T ^ { - 1 }$ at low temperatures under different pressures exhibits a linear relation except those under $P = 0$ and O.16 GPa. The linear behavior of $\mathrm { l n } \rho$ vs. $T ^ { - 1 }$ （204号 unambiguously suggests a gapped insulating behavior. The linear fiting of ln $\rho$ vs. $T ^ { - 1 }$ is performed, where $\Delta E$ as a function of $P$ is plotted in Fig. 3 (b). It can be seen that $\Delta E$ （204 increases monotonously as the pressure increases.

As we know, the MIT in AzIr $_ 2$ O $7$ usually occurs concomitantly with the spin ordering transition of an all-in/all-out spin configuration, which suggests a coupling between electron and magnetism [3,7]. Thus, the magnetization of BizIr $^ 2$ O $^ 7$ under pressures should be investigated to clarify the relation between the transport and magnetism. Figure 4 shows the field dependence of magnetization $[ M ( H ) ]$ under ambient pressure at selected temperature. It can be seen that all $M ( H )$ curves exhibit paramagnetic behaviors without long-range spinordering,which is in agreement with the previous reports [16,30]. However, it has been demonstrated that BizIr $_ 2$ ○ $7$ exhibits weak ferromagnetic behavior at very low temperature [19].

Figure 5 (a） shows the $M ( H )$ curves at 4 K under selected pressures. At the fixed pressure, the magnetization increases as the pressure increases, which indicates that the magnetic ordering tendency becomes more and more prominent. This result suggests that the pressure enhances the magnetic coupling in this system. Figure 5 (b) gives the saturation magnetization $[ M _ { S } ]$ at 7 T as a function of pressure. The $M _ { S }$ increases monotonously with the increase of pressure, which indicates the enhancement of the magnetization by the pressure.

These results suggest that the MIT induced by the pressure is correlated with the enhancement of magnetization by the pressure, which indicates intimate magneto-electronic coupling in this system. In fact,an MIT is also induced by the Ca-doping on A-sites in Bi $_ { 2 - x }$ Ca $_ { x }$ Ir2O $^ 7$ [30]. However, the substitution of $\mathrm { B i ^ { 3 + } }$ by $\mathrm { C a ^ { 2 + } }$ brings holes, defects, disorders in the system in addition to the change of bond length and bond angle. In this work, through the pressure which is a pure device, it is demonstrated that an MIT can be induced by the pressure. In fact,the pressure brings two effects into the system, the shrinkage of the bond length and the change of the bond angle. As we know, the ionic radius of Bi $^ { 3 + }$ is bigger than any other in A2Ir $_ 2$ O $7$ . However,its lattice constant lies between that of Eu2IrO $7$ and Nd2Ir $_ 2$ O $7$ . Both EuzIr2O $7$ and Nd2Ir $_ 2$ O $7$ undergo an MIT with the decrease of temperature. If speculated from the aspect of bond length, the BizIr $_ 2$ O $^ 7$ should also undergo an MIT. Instead, Bi2Ir2O $^ 7$ exhibits a metallic behavior in the whole measuring temperature range, which suggests the bond length is not determinant fact in the MIT.It is noticed that the bond angle of BizIr2O $^ 7$ is close to those of Nd2Ir2O $7$ ，Sm $^ { 2 }$ Ir2O $7$ , and EuzIr2O $7$ , all of which undergo MITs [26]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that the pressure tends to change the Ir-O-Ir bond angle by rotating the IrO $_ 6$ octahedron in the iridates [32]. Therefore, in the A2Ir $^ 2$ O $7$ , the change of bond angle by pressure tends to play a determinant role in the transport behavior. The experimental results of pressure suggest that the decrease of Ir-O-Ir bond angle in BizIr $_ 2$ O $7$ enhances magnetic ordering,which in turn leads to the localization of the itinerant electrons.

# IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, the resistivity and magnetization of BizIr $_ 2$ 0 $7$ are investigated under hydro static pressure. An MIT at low temperature is induced on the $\rho ( T )$ by the pressure of $\sim$ 0.48 GPa. The $T _ { M I }$ increases linearly with pressure as $\mathrm { d } T _ { M I } / \mathrm { d } P = 3 . 4 \pm 0 . 3$ K/GPa, which shows a positive pressure effect. The magnetization is enhanced by the pressure, which indicates an enhancement of magnetic ordering. The results suggest that the itinerant electrons are localized due to the magnetic ordering induced by the pressure, which confirms the magneto-electronic coupling in BizIr $^ 2$ O $^ 7$ ：
