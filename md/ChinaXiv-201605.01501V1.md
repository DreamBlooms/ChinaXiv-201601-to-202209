# 1.INTRODUCTION

Molecular imaging is a precious_ tool for molecular biology research and clinical medicine.1-3 The design， synthesis, and characterization of the proper molecular imaging probes are the priority topic for researchersworldwide inthis area.45 Nanoparticles bring the convenience for the design of multifunctional probes due to the flexibility of the sizes and materials. However，most nanoplatforms， such as quantum dots，gold nanoparticles,have been established with inorganic materials，which are difficult to degrade by the human bodies.6-8

Liposomes are excellent candidates for molecular imaging because of easy combination with various functionalities and, perhaps most importantly,their biocompatibility.′Liposomes appear to be attractive due to the ability to be labeled with radioisotopes,as well as paramagnetic and fluorescent contrast agents.Liposomes have been applied in nuclear imaging by loading radioisotopes or labeling radioisotopes $\big ( ^ { 9 9 \mathrm { m } } \mathrm { T c } , ^ { \mathrm { \scriptsize ~ i 1 1 } } \mathrm { I n } ,$ $^ { 6 7 } \mathrm { G a } , \ ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { F } ,$ and $^ { 6 4 } \mathrm { C u } \dot { }$ ）to study pharmacokinetics or to visualize tumors by SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography）or PET (positron emission computed tomography) imaging. Most importantly, liposomes have a long-standing history in medical research and clinical practice for use as vehicles to deliver either drugs to target tissue or organ of diseases with high accumulation by producing in nanoscale, long circulating by stealth effect,enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, and specific targeting by modifying with specific ligandsormarkers.11oweverliposomestilhave not attained their full potential as vehicles for therapeutic drugs and contrast agents because of their insufficient morphological stability.

Recently,a hybrid liposomal cerasome has attracted broad attention as a novel delivery system because its silica-like surface imparts higher morphological stability than traditional liposomes and its liposomal bilayer reduces the overall rigidity anddensity greatlyascompared tosilica nanoparticles1214 Various therapeutic drugs and imaging agents can be easily loaded into the central aqueous core or lipid bilayer of cersomes.14 Cerasomes combine the advantages of both liposomes and silica nanoparticles but overcome their disadvantages so cerasomes are ideal delivery systems for therapeutic agents. However, the tumor targeting capability and in vivo biobehavior of cerasomes have not been thoroughly studied yet.

Photothermal therapy (PTT）driven by near-infrared (NIR) light has attracted intensive research interest as a promising strategy for cancer treatment due to its noninvasive,targeted, andextracorporeallysteableprocedure.519Byapplyigfor photothermal agents,NIR light energy can be converted into hyperpyrexia for target ablation of cancerous tumor without the injury of the surrounding healthy tissue.Especially，recent interests have been focused on the development of multifunctional photothermal agent with appropriate imaging capability for safe and effective PTTtreatment.20-25 In combination with imaging equipment， the imaging capabilities of such agents enable us to visualize the location of cancerous tumor for guiding PTT monitoring of the therapeutic process in real-time, and evaluate the effectiveness after therapy， providing us more opportunities for more specific and individualized cancer treatments.26-30

Indocyanine green (ICG) is currently the only Federal Drug Administration (FDA） approved NIR fluorescent agent for clinicalapplications.31,32Becauseof thestrong absorption in the NIR region and the relative high photothermal conversion efficiency, ICG can operate as a photothermal agent for NIR laser-mediated PTT.3,34 4Ascompared to other reported photothermal agents,ICG takes some advantages due to its clinical approved safety and the intrinsic theranostic capability.3 However, the aggregate-prone propertypoor aqueous stability,fast clearance,and lack of target specificity are still the major challenges for its better application in optical imaging and cancer treatment.36-39 Attacking such problems head on, numerous nanoparticle (NP） delivery systems have been developed to load ICG to improve its stability and pharmacokinetics， resulting in durable optical imaging and efficient photothermal therapy.40-43

In this Article, 177Lu-labeled cerasome encapsulating ICG was engineered from the mixture of cholesteryl succinyl silane and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine $. N .$ [carboxy(polyethylene glycol)20oo]-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tetraaceticacid monoamide $\big ( \mathrm { D S P E - P E G } _ { 2 0 0 0 } \cdot$ DOTA） by sol gel reaction and self-assembly process,followed by chelating radioisotope of $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ (as shown in Figure. 1). Because of the favorable nuclearcharacteristics $\left( T ( 1 / \hat { 2 } ) = 6 . 7 1 \right.$ d, $E _ { \mathrm { g } } ( \mathrm { m a x } ) = 0 . 2 0 8$ MeV, $E _ { \mathrm { b } } \mathrm { { ( m a x ) } = 0 . 4 9 7 ~ M e V , }$ ), $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ is an attractive radionuclide for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Radiolabeling with $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u } ,$ cerasome was studied for nuclear imaging and in vivo quantitative evaluation. The encapsulated ICG was used for both NIR fluorescence imaging and photothermal ablation of cancer cells.

Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital at a dose of $4 5 . 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m g / k g }$ ，Blood was harvested from orbital sinus at1,10,20,30,60,90,120,180,240,360,1440,2880, and $4 3 2 0 \ \mathrm { m i n } ,$ ，weighed,and measured for radioactivity in a $\gamma \mathrm { . }$ counter (Wallac 1470-Oo2,PerkinElmer,Finland).Theradioactivity in blood was calculated as a percentage of the injected dose per gram $\left( \% \mathrm { I D / g } \right)$ ： Biodistribution experiment was also performed to quantificationally study the in vivo distribution of $\mathrm { I C } \mathrm { \bar { G } } @ \mathrm { D P D C s ^ { 1 7 7 } } \mathrm { \bar { L } u }$ in all of the organs and the uptake in tumor area.A total of 16 LLC tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into four groups,each of them containing four individuals.A total of $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of ICG@DPDCs $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ dispersion $\binom { 1 7 7 } { } \mathrm { L u } 0 . 3 7$ MBq， $2 ~ \mathrm { \ m g / m L }$ of the NPs）was administered intravenously to each mouse.Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital at a dose of 45.0 $\mathrm { m g / k g } .$ Time-dependent biodistribution studies were carried out by sacrificing mice at 4,24,48,and $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ p.i.Blood,heart, liver,spleen, kidney,stomach, intestine,muscle,bone,and tumor were harvested, weighed,and measured for radioactivity in a $\gamma$ counter. The organ uptake was calculated as a percentage of injected doses per gram of wet tissue mass $\left( \% \ \mathrm { I D / g } \right)$ ：

2.14.In Vivo Photothermal Therapy.Mice bearing LLC tumors were randomly divided into four groups ${ \mathit { \Omega } } ^ { \prime } n = 6 )$ including $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs $^ +$ laser group, free ICG $^ +$ laser group, ${ \mathrm { P B S } } +$ laser group, and agent only group.After intravenous injection of $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of an aqueous solution of ICG $@$ DPDCsor free ICG (at the same dose of $2 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g }$ of ICG), tumors in the two treatment groups were irradiated by $8 0 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ continuous-wave diode NIR laser at $1 . { \bar { S } } { \bar { \mathrm { ~ W ~ } } } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .

# 3.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1.Preparation and Characterization of the Nanoparticles. ICG $@$ DPDCs were prepared by sol-gel reaction and self-assembly process from cholesteryl succinyl silane and DSPE- $\mathrm { . P E G } _ { 2 0 0 0 }$ -DOTA at the molar ratio of $9 5 \% { : } 5 \%$ After hydrolyzing the triethoxysilyl group，the lipid bilayer selfasembled via the strong hydrophobic interaction and rigidified via in situ sol-gel reaction $\mathrm { ( S i { - } O C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 3 } + H _ { 2 } O  S i { - } O H + }$ $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O H }$ followed by $2 \mathrm { S i } { \mathrm { - O H } }  \mathrm { S i } { \mathrm { - O - S i } } + \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } )$ on the vesicle surface upon ultrasonication.Both TEM and SEM images revealed that ICG@DPDCs were well-defined and spherical before and after chelating $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ (Figure 2A,B,D,E). In agreement with TEM and SEM measurements,the dynamic light scattering data showed that ICG@DPDCs possessed a narrow size distribution of $5 4 . 1 6 \pm 5 . 3 4 \mathrm { { \ n m } , }$ favorable to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR）effect in tumor vasculature for passive targeting (Figure 2C).As shown in Figure S2, the two distinctive absorption bands at11oO and 950 $\mathsf { c m } ^ { - 1 } .$ ，attributed to the vibration of $S \mathrm { i { - } O H }$ group and $S \mathrm { i - O - }$ Si, proved the presence of a highly polymerized silicate network around the surface of $\mathrm { I C G } @ \mathrm { D P D C s }$ .Resembling silica particles, $\operatorname { I C G } \textcircled { a } \operatorname { D P D C s }$ fabricated at different mass ratios of ICG to lipid were negatively charged,and the zeta-potentials were in the range from $- 2 8 . 8 5 \pm 3 . 6 4$ to $- 3 2 . 1 2 \pm 4 . 3 1 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ due to deprotonation of the silanol groups on the $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs surface (Table 1).

3.2.UV-Vis Absorption and Fluorescence Properties. ICG molecules could be easily loaded into the lipid bilayer and empty core domain of DPDCs nanoparticles due to their amphiphilic structure and good water solubility.It was found that the mass ratios of ICG to lipids have effects on the loading capacity and the encapsulation efficiency.With increasing the mass ratio of ICG to lipids, the loading capacity increased and the encapsulation efficiency decreased (Table 1).Figure 3A shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of ICG@DPDCs encapsulating different amounts of ICG.The broad absorption band between 65O and $9 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ suggests that ICG@DPDCs would be suitable for photothermal therapy with the light in the NIR region,where there is minimum light absorption in tissues. As shown in Figure 3B, the encapsulation of ICG into the mixed cerasomes of DPDCs led to a red shift of the characteristic maximum absorption peak of ICG (from 779 to $7 8 9 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ).The red shift might be attributed to the strong interaction between ICG molecules and cerasomes.The aggregation of ICG molecules usually accompanies the occurrence of fluorescence quenching. As shown in Figure 3C and $\mathrm { { D } } _ { \mathrm { { ; } } }$ ,the fluorescence intensity was remarkably enhanced after loading into the DPDCs as compared to free ICG.In addition, the fluorescence intensity of ICG@DPDCs increased with decreasing the mass ratio of ICG to lipids.It can be explained that the amphiphilic molecules in the lipid layer could effectively separate ICG molecule from each other,resulting in the red-shifted absorption and the minimized fluorescence quenching.45 In consideration of the absorbance value, fluorescence intensity,as well as the loading capacity and the encapsulation efficiency, ICG@DPDCs fabricated at the mass ratio(ICG:lipids) of 1:6 were thus chosen for further investigation.

3.3.Structural Stability of the Nanoprticles.Radioisotope of $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ can be readily coupled onto the ICG@DPDCs surface.Figure S3 revealed that the radiolabeling yield was $6 3 . 6 6 \%$ and the radiochemical purity after purification was $9 9 . 9 3 \%$ . Figure S4 showed the strong chelating between $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ and $\mathrm { I C G @ D P D C s }$ less than $4 \%$ of $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ was released from the NPs after incubation in PBS for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .Because of the presence of rigid polyorganosiloxane networks, ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ can keep structural integrity (Figure 2D and E),but the diameter of ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ had an increase of about $5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ after chelating $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ in a rather harsh environment $\left( \mathrm { p H } ~ 4 . 5 , 9 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \right)$ （20

as shown in Figure 2F.Almost no decrease of absorbance and fluorescence intensity was seen during the process of radiolabeling，indicating that the cerasomal vesicles could protect ICG from leakingand degradation in high temperature (Figure 3E and F).The structural stability of NPs was evaluated by the widely used surfactant dissolution method.'4 When 10 equiv of the Triton X-10o was added to 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE)-based liposomes，a significant reduction in the hydrodynamic diameter was seen, indicating the rapid collapse of the liposomes.In contrast, both ICG@DPDCs and ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ showed almost no change in their hydrodynamic diameters for a long time even in the presence of SO equiv of Triton X-1oo (Figure S5). It suggested the excellent architectural stability of the cerasomes.

3.4. Photohyperthermic Behavior of ${ \mathsf { I C G @ } }$ DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathsf { L u }$ .The photohyperthermic behavior of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing )$ DPDCs-177Lu was investigated under the iradiation of $8 0 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ continuous-wave NIR laser at the output power of $1 . 5 \mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ Figure 4A showed the temperature collected by a digital thermometer every 1O s under irradiation of DI water and ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ with ICG concentrations of 10, 20,and 50 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ .It was found that the temperature elevated with increasing the irradiation time and concentration of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs- $^ { \mathrm { i 7 7 } } \mathrm { L u } .$ The temperature elevations of 8.9,17.1，and $2 0 . 2 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ were achieved after $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ NIR laser irradiation of

ICG@DPDCs $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ at the ICG concentrations of 10,20,and $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ,$ respectively.In contrast,no obvious temperature elevation was observed when DI water was exposed to the same laser irradiation.This result demonstrated the excellent photothermal efficiency of $\mathrm { I C G } @ \mathrm { D P D C s ^ { 1 7 7 } L u } .$

For comparative investigation of the photostability of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs, ICG@DPDCs $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u } ,$ and free ICG molecules under the exposure of NIR light, treatments containing three cycles of NIR laser on/off were used. Solutions of ICG@DPDCs, $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u } ,$ and free ICG were exposed to NIR laser for 10 min,followed by naturally cooling to room temperature with no NIR laser exposure for $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ (laser off).Such a laser on/ off cycle was repeated three times.At the same ICG concentration of $5 5 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ，the temperature elevations of 23.7, 19.5, and $1 8 . 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ solution, 23.4, 20.3,and $1 9 . 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for ICG@DPDCs solution,and 22.4,10.6, and $6 . 8 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for free ICG solution were observed after three consecutive cycles of NIR laser on/off, respectively (Figure 4B).For free ICG solution, the temperature elevation rapidly decreased with increasing the number of laser on/off cycles.On the contrary, the temperature elevations were well repeated for both ICG@DPDCs and ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u } ,$ demonstrating that the encapsulation of ICG inside cerasomal nanoparticles conduced to excellent photostability.

3.5.Photohyperthermic Cytotoxicity of ICG@DPDCs. The cellular uptake of ICG@DPDCs was investigated in comparison with free ICG using fluorescence microscopy before the investigation of their therapeutic potential.Upon excitation by the light of $7 4 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，both free ICG and ICG encapsulated in ICG@DPDCs exhibit a red fluorescence.As shown in Figure SA,after incubation for $^ { 4 \ \mathrm { h } , }$ LLC cells incubated with ICG@DPDCs were significantly brighter than free ICG incubated cells,and the fluorescence intensity of the former was evaluated to be 4-fold as much as the latter (Figure S6).This result indicated that ICG@DPDCs can be internalized more efficiently by LLC cells through endocytosis. In comparison with free ICG，the excellent cellular uptake efficiency of ICG@DPDCsis favorable to photothermally ablate cancer cells at the same ICG dosage.

To visualize the photohyperthermic cytotoxicity of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs in vitro,Lewis lung cancer cell lines (LLC cells) were incubated with the ICG@DPDCs and free ICG for $^ { 4 } \ \mathrm { h } ,$ followed by exposure to NIR laser ( $8 0 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and $1 . 5 \mathrm { W } \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } ,$ for $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ .Various combination treatments with agent and NIR laser were used for comparative study.The photohyperthermic cytotoxicity was evaluated by using the double staining method with calcein AM and PI. Calcein AM can be hydrolyzed into strongly green fluorescent calcein by intracellular esterases in viable cells,while PI can interact with the nucleic acid in dead cells to create strong red fluorescence.After the double staining,red fluorescence representing the death of cancer cells was observed in the combination of both the agent $\operatorname { T C G } ( \omega$ DPDCs and free ICG）and the NIR laser，while other combination treatments displayed bright green fluorescence in the entire area (Figure SC). It suggested that exposing cancer cells to either agent or high intensity NIR laser alone did not compromise cell viability.Upon laser irradiation, the LLC cells incubated with free ICG showed a partial red fluorescence, while the LLC cells incubated with ICG@DPDCs exhibited an entire red fluorescence,indicating a remarkably higher photothermal cytotoxicity of ICG@DPDCs.

To further quantify the photohyperthermic cytotoxicity of ICG@DPDCs,a standard MTT assay was used to evaluate the inhibitory profile of ICG@DPDCs and free ICG against LLC cells under NIR laser irradiation.Without NIR laser irradiation, ICG@DPDCs and free ICG showed almost no toxicity to LLC cells，demonstrating the high biocompatibility of the agent alone (Figure SB).However,under a simultaneous treatment with agent and NIR laser ( $\cdot 1 . 5 \mathrm { W } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ $1 0 \mathrm { m i n } \dot { }$ ), the viability of LLC cells significantly decreased as the concentrations of ICG@DPDCs and free ICG increased.It was found that the photothermal cytotoxicity of $\mathrm { I C G } @ \mathrm { D P D C s }$ wasobviously higher than that of free ICG at all ICG concentrations.At the highest dosage,the cellular viability decreased to about $4 1 . 1 \%$ for free ICG $^ +$ laser and about $4 . 3 \%$ for ICG@DPDCs $^ +$ laser. Thus，our data provided strong evidence that ICG@DPDCs displayed remarkably higher photothermal cytotoxicity in comparison with free ICG through the more efficient cellular endocytosis.

3.6.In Vivo NanoScan SPECT/CT Imaging of ${ \mathsf { I C G } } ( \alpha$ DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathsf { L u }$ ，To evaluate the feasibility of applying nuclear imaging for dynamically monitoring the accumulation of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs- $^ { \mathrm { 1 7 7 } } \mathrm { L u }$ in the tumor region and guiding the photothermal ablation of tumor,a whole-body NanoScan SPECT/ CT imaging procedure was performed on LLC tumor-bearing mouse by intravenous injection of ICG@DPDCs-177Lu at the dose of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g }$ 0 $^ { \mathrm { 7 1 7 7 } } \mathrm { L u } \ \mathrm { 1 1 . 1 \ M B q ) }$ ，which was equal to the dose used for NIR fluorescent imaging. Figure 6B showed that tumor was clearly visulized at all test time points.Besides tumor， the main accumulation of $\mathrm { I C G } @ \mathrm { D P D C s ^ { 1 7 7 } L u }$ was found in the liver and spleen,which is in agreement with the in vivo uptake characteristics of nanomaterials. Because of clearance of the radiotracer from the background, the contrast of tumor region to adjacent tissue increased gradually throughout the $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ post injection,and reached the maximum at $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ p.i.，then gradually decreased to 72 p.i.，which is consistent with the result of NIR fluorescent imaging. With the help of the 3D-reconstructed SPECT/CT images, the position of tumor and the accumulation of ICG@DPDCs $^ { \mathrm { 1 7 7 } } \mathrm { L u }$ in tumor region contrasted with clear background could be easily visualized,which can help the researcher find the best timewindow for guiding the photothermal therapy through the NanoScan SPECT/CT imaging.

3.7.Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution. To quantificationally study the in vivo biobehavior of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 \dot { 7 } } \mathrm { L u }$ a dose of $0 . 2 ~ \mathrm { \ m L }$ of ICG@DPDCs $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ dispersion $\left( 2 \mathrm { \ m g / m L } \right)$ of the NPs containing 0.37 MBq of $^ { \mathrm { 1 7 7 } } \mathrm { \bar { L } u ) }$ was administrated to the normal BALB/c mice and LLC tumor-bearing mice,respectively,and the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution experiments were performed at test time points. The blood radioactivity measurements showed that the pharmacokinetics of ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ fitted a two-compartment open model with the fast and slow phase half-lives at 2.6 and $^ { 1 1 9 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ during blood circulation， respectively (Figure 6A). The selected quantitative biodistribution and tumor-to-nontumorratio datawere shown in Figure 6C andD.The detailed biodistribution and target-to-background ratio data are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. The tumor uptake of ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ was $3 . 2 5 \pm 1 . 2 2 \% _ { \cdot }$ $1 . 9 1 \pm 0 . 3 9 \%$ ， $0 . 6 5 \pm$

$0 . 2 7 \%$ ，and $0 . 4 7 ~ \pm ~ 0 . 1 0 \% ~ \mathrm { I D } /$ $\mathrm { I D / g }$ at 4，24，48，and $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ postinjection,respectively.Besides the tumor, the major uptake was found in the liver and spleen，with values of $8 6 . 0 2 ~ \pm$ $1 3 . 1 3 \%$ ， $6 3 . 0 2 \pm 9 . 1 1 \% ,$ $4 5 . 5 7 \pm 1 1 . 9 7 \%$ ，and $4 6 . 3 7 \pm 9 . 4 4 \%$ $\mathrm { I D / g }$ for liver，and $2 9 . 9 9 \pm 1 . 9 8 \%$ ， $1 4 . 4 4 \pm 2 . 9 7 \% _ { ; }$ ， $1 0 . 7 5 \pm$ $5 . 5 6 \%$ and $9 . 1 7 \pm 3 . 5 6 \% \mathrm { I D / g }$ for spleen at 4,24,48,and 72 p.i.,respectively. The nonspecific uptake in the other tissues (heart, stomach, pancreas,intestine,kidneys）was ${ < 5 \% } \ \mathrm { I D / g }$ at all test time points.Most of the tumor-to-nontargeted tissue ratios showed similar changing tendency, such as the tumor-tomuscle ratio increased from $3 . 4 8 \pm 2 . 1 5$ (4 h p.i.） to $6 . 9 3 \pm$ 2.60 ( $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ p.i.),and then decreased to $2 . 8 8 \pm 1 . 5 3 \$ and $2 . 5 7 \pm$ 1.71 at 48 and $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ p.i., respectively,which was consistent with the SPECT imaging results (Figure 6C,D).

3.8.In Vivo Fluorescence Imaging of ICG@DPDCs. Figure 7A and B showed the fluorescence intensities of vital organs and tumors in mice after the injection of free ICG and ICG@DPDCs, respectively. Obviously,a great difference in the fluorescent distribution was seen between the two mice groups injected with free ICG and ICG@DPDCs.For the free ICG group,the fluorescence signals of liver were much higher than that of tumor and other organs，indicating that free ICG molecules could accumulate mainly in liver and not in tumor because they were absorbed by serum proteins such as albumin and lipoproteins and were selectively trapped at liver.44 In addition,it was found that the total of fluorescence intensity was remarkably decreased as the time increased, suggesting that free ICG molecules can be fast excreted from liver and other organs,in agreement with the published results.45 On the contrary，ICG@DPDCs was very different from free ICG molecules.It was observed to increase with time during the 24 h post injection,providing strong evidence that ICG@DPDCs with suitable size could selectively accumulate in the tumor. It was attributed to the EPR effect in tumor vasculature and the introduction of the PEG molecules onto the surface of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \omega$ DPDCs,which could inhibit our agent from the macrophage recognition at reticuloendo-thelial system (RES),leading to a prolonged blood circulation time.

A whole body NIR imaging approach was further employed to investigate the tumor targeting capability of ICG@DPDCs on LLC tumor-bearing mice by intravenous injection of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs at the dose of $2 0 \mathrm { \ m g / k g }$ (ICG dose of $2 \ \mathrm { m g / k g ) }$ Figure 7C displayed the fluorescence signal as a function of time for ICG@DPDCs and free ICG delivered systemically via intravenous injections.At 1 and $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 4 h }$ after injection $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs，only weak fluorescence signals were observed throughout the mouse body.As time increased the fluorescence signals increased and almost located around the tumor after 24 h postinjection， suggesting that a large amount of $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs circulated in the blood circulation and then accumulated at the tumor site.As seen in Figure 7D,a great difference in the tumor distribution was seen between $\operatorname { I C G } ( \omega$ DPDCs and free ICG molecules after $2 4  { \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ postinjection through tail vein.ICG@DPDCs showed strong fluorescence signals but only weak signals from the free ICG group in the tumor site.These preliminary data provided a good evidence of the high efficiency of passive tumor targeting of ICG@DPDCs.

However,it is worth noting that the fluorescence intensities of vital organs after the injection of ICG@DPDCs were obviously different from the previous result of SPECT/CT imaging.As reported in the literature，Shi and co-workers confirmed that mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs） could be partly degraded in vivo and excreted through the renal excretion route.46 Thus， cerasome with single-layer silica-like surface is likely to be degraded in vivo through the same route asMSNs,resulting in a certain degree of ICGleakage after a certain period postinjection.Because of the fast metabolismand excretion rate of ICG,liver and spleen showed decreased fluorescence signals.On the contrary, the tumor site displayed increased fluorescence intensity，which is attributed to the sufficient penetration of the released ICG throughout the tumor, decreasing the fluorescence quenching effect caused by the aggregation of ICG molecules. Such sufficient diffusion of ICG in tumor site is advantaged for photothermal tumor ablation by achieving a homogeneous hyperpyrexia under NIR laserirradiation.

3.9.In Vivo Photothermal Therapy Using ICG@DPDCs. To evaluate in vivo photothermal therapy using ICG@DPDCs, LLC tumor-bearing mice were divided into four groups,and received the treatments of PBS buffer $^ +$ NIR laser, free $\mathrm { I C G } +$ NIR laser, ICG@DPDCs only,and $\mathrm { I C G } @ \mathrm { D P D C s } + \mathrm { N I R }$ laser, respectively.As we know from the above in vivo fluorescence and NanoScan SPECT/CT imaging results， the optimum accumulation ofICG@DPDCs and freeICG in the tumor site could be achieved after the injection of $\operatorname { I C G } \textcircled { a } \operatorname { D P D C s }$ and free ICG for 24 and $^ { \textrm { 1 h , } }$ respectively.Hence,mice tumors in $\operatorname { I C G } ( \varnothing $ DPDCs $^ +$ NIR laser and free $\mathrm { I C G } + \mathrm { N I R }$ laser groups were exposed to the $8 0 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ laser at a power density of $1 . 5 \mathrm { \ : W } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ for $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at the best therapy window after the injection of $\mathrm { I C G @ D P D C s }$ and free ICG for 24 and $^ { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h , ~ } }$ respectively. Because of the photothermal effect of $\mathrm { I C G } @ \mathrm { D P D C s }$ ，the average temperature of cancerous tumor was rapidly elevated from 36.5 to $5 7 . 3 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under the laser irradiation (Figure 8A), which was high enough to ablate effciently the cancer cells.In contrast,the temperature in the tumor area treated with free ICG $^ +$ NIR laser was not obviously affected after laser irradiation (Figure 8A).The therapeutic effectivenesswas evaluated by measuring the tumor sizes,and the representative mice photographs of each group were recorded at certain days after treatment (Figure 8B and C).Mice tumors treated with agent only, $\mathrm { P B } S +$ laser,and free ICG $^ +$ laser increased rapidly over 18 days (Figure 8B),indicating that the tumor growth could not be affected by either ICG@DPDCs or NIR laser irradiation alone as well as the presence of a low amount of free ICG combined NIR laser irradiation.The absence ofa significantly harmful effect by treatment with free ICG combined NIR laser irradiation was not surprising in light of the low mean peak temperatures elevation measured in the tumors during the exposures (Figure 8A). In stark contrast, after treatment with ICG@DPDCs in combination NIR irradiation，the growth of cancerous tumors was significantly inhibited and ceased, leaving black scars at their original sites without showing reoccurrence (Figure 8C).Further hematoxylin and eosin(H&E）staining of tumor slices was carried out for tumors collected immediately after laser irradiation (Figure 8D).As expected，significant cancer cell damage，such as karyorrhexis and karyolysis,was observed merely in the tumor after treatment with both ICG@DPDCs injection in combination with NIR laser irradiation，but not in the other three control groups. It confirmed again the significant therapeutic effectiveness of ICG@DPDCs under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore，ICG@DPDCs could be used as a powerful photothermal agent for in vivo PTT treatment of cancer.

3.10.Toxicology. To evaluate the in vivo toxicity of the ICG@DPDCs to healthy tissue，healthy mice were intravenously injected with the NPs at a dose of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ which is equal to that of the imaging/therapy dose. Serum biochemistry assays in Figure 9A showed that hematological parameters including white blood cells (WBC)，red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT)，and neutrophile granulocyte (GRN）have slight fluctuation in the early stage after injection.Nevertheless, all measured hematological parameters in ICG@DPDCs injected mice recovered to the normal ranges after 1O days post injection. Change of mice body weight was also investigated,as shown in Figure 9B. Throughout the period of the study,neither mouse death nor loss of body weight was observed for those mice administrated with ICG@DPDCs.In addition,histological sectionof liver,heart,spleen,kidney,and lung with H&E staining showed normality in the cellular structures as untreated control group，and neither noticeable organ damage nor inflammation could be observed (Figure 9C).All results ensure that ICG@DPDCs can be a safe agent for medical application.

# 4.CONCLUSION

A promising theranostic nanoparticle of ICG@DPDCs- $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ was successfully fabricated for NIR fluorescence/nuclear dualmodality imaging and photothermal ablation of cancer. The cerasome encapsulated ICG showed excellent improvement in photostability and blood circulation time as compared to free ICG molecules and can induce intense temperature elevation under NIR laser exposure.Both in vivo nuclear and fluorescence imaging demonstrated the high tumor targeting efficiency of ICG $@$ DPDCs-177Lu. Experiments in vitro and in vivo confirmed that ICG@DPDCs could effectively ablate cancer cells through photothermal effects. Besides, the strategy of labeling cerasomes with theranostic radionuclide $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ enabled the ability of the $^ { 1 7 7 } \mathrm { L u }$ -labeled cerasomes to be used for radionuclide cancer therapy and even the combined therapy. The ability to track the uptake of cerasomes on a whole body basis could provide researchers with an excellent tool for developing cerasome-based therapeutic agents.
