Abstract: High-energy electron precipitation in the high latitude regions enhances the ionization of the atmosphere,and subsequently increases the atmospheric conductivities and the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground as well. The high-energy electron flux (HEEF) data measured by the Feng-Yun II meteorological satellite are analyzed together with the data of near-surface atmospheric vertical electric field measured at the Russian Vostok Station. Three HEEF enhancements are identified and show that when the HEEF increases to a certain level, the local atmospheric vertical electric field near the ground can increase substantially than usual. The time of the response of the electric field to the HEEF enhancement is about 3.7 to 4 days (delay time).

# 0. Introduction

It has been demonstrated that the solar energy particles are able to affect the mesospheric electric field,and also afect the atmospheric vertical electric field near the ground. The solar proton events (SPE) are capable of creating a measurable change to the electric field at ground level ( ${ \sim } 5 \%$ change)[1l. One result of SPE incident in the middle atmosphere is the generation of enhanced charged particle densities，and a substantial increase in the middle and upper atmospheric conductivities 21. Holzworth and Reagan expresed that the atmospheric electric field changes because the atmospheric conductivities have changed [2.3l. Frank regarded that the interplanetary magnetic field could also change the vertical atmospheric electric field [41.

A working model linking the ground to the atmosphere is the global electric circuit (GEC), which is one result of the thunderstorm activities [4].This model is ilustrated in Fig.1.5-7]. The thunderstorms act as a voltage source, V, driving current upward from the ground through the upper atmosphere $( R _ { h } )$ . The current path extends through the stratosphere and is completed via downward currents in the fair-weather atmosphere ( $( R _ { s } ^ { l o c } + R _ { t } )$ in regions well away from the storm[4].

The vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground is mainly decided by the current density $J _ { z }$ . There are many independent ways in which the solar wind modulates the flow of current ensity $J _ { z }$ in the $\mathrm { G E C } ^ { [ 5 , 6 , 8 ] }$ ，such as (a)theglacticosmicray9,]fromwhichay Complexnumealsimulatiosebndoe1（helatiitcectropriati 13-15] and(c） changesintheionosphericpotentialdistributiondueto the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling[5,16,17] Farrelland Desch has found that the SPE can decrease the $R _ { h }$ in the thunderstorm region,and then $J _ { { z } }$ will increase[1]. The equation of the conductivity is:

$$
\sigma = \sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } } \exp { ( z / z _ { { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } } ) }
$$

The conductivity near the ground keeps as a constant, according to the Ohm law:

$$
\boldsymbol { \mathrm { J } } _ { z } \ = \sigma \boldsymbol { E } _ { z }
$$

If the $J _ { { z } }$ increases，the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground（ $E _ { z }$ ） increases absolutely.

The relativistic electron precipitation can effectively enhance the ionization of the stratosphere by generating X-ray. With an increase of the ionization in the stratosphere, the local resistance between the stratosphere and the troposphere ( $R _ { s } ^ { l o c }$ ）decreases, and thereby increase $J _ { z }$ . According to the equation (2),the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground can be affected--it will increase. The weather in the storm regions could also be affected. The precipitation of relativistic electrons can excite $\mathrm { \Delta } X$ -rays in the atmosphere,which will then increase theionizatioinhoweatospre-siig.2.

Fig.2.The vertical height range of the relativistic electron precipitation effect.

In Fig.1, the relativistic electron enhances the ionization of the stratosphere by generating X-rays.With the enhancement of the ionization in the stratosphere,the local resistance between stratosphere and troposphere （ $R _ { s } ^ { l o c }$ ）decreased, and then $J _ { z }$ increased. After that, the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground would be afected,the electric field would increase,and the weather in the storm regions willbe affected. According to the Gauss equation,

$$
\rho ( z ) / \varepsilon \ _ { _ 0 } = \nabla \bullet \overrightarrow { E }
$$

where $\rho ( z )$ represents the space charge generated by the electric field gradient. The electric field gradient changes the distribution of the charge in the clouds,affects the microphysics of the clouds, and then changes the parameter of the weather andthe climate[5,8,21l，such as the atmospheric vortices[6,

# 1.Data Presentation

The HEEF data measured by the Feng-YunII satellite in 2O12,and the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground measured at the Russian Vostok Station $( 7 8 ^ { 0 } S , 1 0 6 ^ { 0 } E ^ { . }$ ） in 2012 have been used and well analyzed. The HEEF data during the period of satellite flying over the Russian Vostok Station (the satellite passed the longitude between $\boldsymbol { 1 0 0 } ^ { \circ } \boldsymbol { E }$ and $1 1 5 ^ { \circ } E$ ， latitude between $\boldsymbol { 7 0 } ^ { \circ } \boldsymbol { S }$ and 90° $s$ ，seen in Fig. 3) has been selected, the satellite passed through this region nearly 219O times in the year 2O12,and the data-fiting method has been used to study the tendency of these HEEF data.Three HEEF enhancement events have been found and only one event has strong enhancement (the event 1 of HEEF enhancement had been illustrated in Fig. 4, the event 2 of HEEF enhancement had been illustrated in Fig.5,and the Fig.6 illustrated the event 3ofHEEF enhancement).

In the Fig. 4 to 6,The top four panels show the HEEF at different energy channels,(a) 0.15 - 0.35 MeV, (b) $0 . 3 5 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 0 . 6 5 ~ \mathrm { M e V } ,$ (c） $0 . 6 5 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 . 2 \mathrm { ~ M e V } ,$ (d) $1 . 2 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 2 . 0 \mathrm { ~ M e V } ,$ the black dashed lines represent the tendency of the HEEF by using the data fiting method,and the red vertical lines on the left and right sides stand for the approximate time when the HEEF begins to increase,and the time when the electric field begins to enhance,respectively.Plot ‘e’shows the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground.Plots‘f' to ‘h' represent the parameters of solar wind,(f) interplanetary magnetic field component,(g) the solar wind velocity,(h) the kinetic pressure of solar wind,these solar wind parameters come from ACE( Advanced Composition Explorer, USA); Plots ‘i' to ‘j' represent the parameters of geomagnetic activity, (i) Dst index and (j) the AE index from WDCKyoto （ these data were all download from: http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/omni min.html). Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 have shown that when the HEEF increases to a certain level, the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground wil increase substantially. The delay time that the electric field begins to increase after HEEF enhancement is about 3.7 to 4 days.

Fig. 4. The top four panels show the HEEF variation of different energy, (a) O.15-0.35 MeV,

(b) 0.35-0.65 MeV,(c) 0.65-1.2 MeV,(d) 1.2-2.0 MeV.Plot ‘e' is the ground electric field.Plots ‘f to ‘h' represent the parameters of solar wind, (f) interplanetary magnetic field component, (g) the solar wind velocity, (h) the kinetic pressure of solar wind. Plots ‘i' to‘j' represent the parameters of geomagnetic activities,(i) Dst index and (j) the AE index.During the period from Jan 19 to Jan 31, there was an interplanetary disturbance from the sun on Jan 22, the Bz varied from $+ 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { n T } }$ to $- 1 0 \ \mathrm { n T }$ ，the solar wind speed varied from $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k m / h }$ to $4 5 0 ~ \mathrm { k m / h }$ ，the pressure of the plasma enhanced from $2 \ \mathrm { n P a }$ to $1 7 \mathrm { \ n P a }$ ，afterwards, there was a geomagnetic storm generated near the time that the left red dashed line indicated, the Dst was about $- 4 0 \ \mathrm { n T } .$ ,and the AE index was about $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n T } ,$ ，the geomagnetic storms led to the HEEF enhance.The event 1 occurred in the interval between the two red dashed lines,the HEEF began to increase at the time that the left red dashed line indicated,after the HEEF declined to the level before enhancement, the electric field began to increase substantially at the time that the right dashed line indicated.There were two electric field enhancements in this event, the first one lasted about 12.5 hours,and the second one lasted about 15.3 hours. The time between the two red dashed lines was about 3.7 days.

Fig. 5. Same as Fig. 4, during the period from May 15 to May 24. There was a geomagnetic

storm generated near the time that the left red dashed line indicated, the Bz was about $- 5 ~ \mathrm { n T }$ ,the solar wind speed was about $3 8 0 ~ \mathrm { k m / h }$ ， the pressure of the plasma was about $1 \ \mathrm { n P a }$ ,the Dst was about $- 2 0 \ \mathrm { n T }$ ，and the AE index was about $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n T } }$ ，these geomagnetic activities led to the following enhancement of the HEEF. The ground electric field had some fluctuations between May 15 and May 17, it might be caused by other factors (for example,the winds). The event 2 occurred in the interval between the two red dashed lines, the Electric field hardly changed during the time that the HEEF enhancement and decline,but began to increase after the time that the right red dashed line indicated.The enhancement lasted about 1O.7 hours.The time between the two red dashed lines was about 4 days.

![](images/7bb753aa237882316c2398b2c3469bf03c5ad9c1205ca80016fbc4a957769b5e.jpg)

Fig. 6. Same as Fig. 4, during the period from Aug 24 to Sep 11. The electric field of the ground fluctuated before the HEEF began to increase between Aug 25 and Aug 30, it may be caused by other factors.Near the time that the left red dashed line indicated,the Bz was about $^ { - 4 }$ nT, the solar wind velocity was about $3 4 0 \ \mathrm { k m / h }$ , the pressure of the plasma was about $1 \ \mathrm { n P a }$ ，the Dst was about $- 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n T }$ ，and the AE index was about $4 0 0 \ \mathrm { n T } .$ The geomagnetic activities generated near the time that the left red dashed line indicated,which led to the HEEF enhancement,but didn't enhance obviously,afterwards,the HEEF declined to the level before enhancement,and the ground electric field didn't have changed.

As shown in Fig.4, the event 1 is more representative and more obvious.Before the right red dashed line,the electric field almost changeless and the magnitude was about $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { V / m }$ There were no other factors that affected it.After about 3.7 days where the HEEF began to enhance, the electric field began to increase substantially. The peak value of the first enhancement was about $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { V / m }$ ,and lasted about 12.3 hours; the peak value of the second enhancement was about 1400 V/m,and lasted about 15.3 hours.Afterwards,the electric field declined to the level before enhancement. Shown in Fig.5,that detailed there were some enhancements before the HEEF began to increase, it might be caused by other factors, which was probably the wind (the wind data has been checked from:http://www.wunderground.com/history/station/89606/2012/4/26/MonthlyHistory.html).But the electric field almost changeless during the HEEF change and started to increase at the time that the left red dashed line indicated.The enhancement lasted about 10.7 hours,and then the electric field declined to the level before enhancement.

While there were some enhancements of the HEEF in the event 3 (seen in Fig. 6),the electric field had no fluctuations. It may be because that the HEEF did not increase to a certain level that can cause the electric field to enhance.We also consider that the HEEF may be not the only factor that caused the electric field to enhance.Nevertheless,if the HEEF increases to a certain level (flux is high nearly ${ 1 0 } ^ { 4 }$ counts $^ \prime c m ^ { 2 } \bullet s r \bullet s$ in the data analysis), the electric field can enhance substantially. It generally takes about 3.7 to 4 days for the electric field to enhance following the HEEF enhancement.

Based on the transport path of the high-energy electron shown in Fig.1,the following physical processes can be understood: The high-energy electron fluxes firstly enhance in the Earth's radiation belts during magnetic storms. After some plasma waves in space diffuse these high energy electrons into the loss cone for atmospheric loss,the precipitation produces $\mathrm { \Delta } X$ -rays. Furthermore,the $\mathrm { \Delta } X$ -ray emissions increase the ionization of the middle-upper atmosphere at high latitudregiosdecrese tealae $R _ { z } ^ { l o c }$ , increase the current density $J _ { _ { z } }$ , and then result in the substantial increase of the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground.

# 2. Discussion and Conclusion

The HEEF data measured by Feng-Yun III satelite and the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground measured at the Russian Vostok station $( 7 8 ^ { 0 } S , 1 0 6 ^ { 0 } E$ ） have been adopted for analyses. The potential influence of the HEEF enhancement on the vertical atmospheric electric field near the ground has been investigated for three identified HEEF enhancements.By comparing them with the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground,it has been found that while the HEEF enhancement may be not the only factor that causes the electric field increase,if the HEEF increases to a certain level,the electric field can enhance substantially.The delay time that the electric field begins to increase after the HEEF enhancement is about 3.7 to 4 days.

It will take some time for the electrons to diffuse and decay.The Feng-Yun II satellite is a low altitude satellite,the life time of the high energy electrons at low altitude has been modeled by Tu et al.[2O1O],and their case study showed that the lifetime of the electron was less than 10 days but longer than 1 day for almost all energy electrons[25]. In another paper, Li et al.[2001] found that the average electron life time is approximately 2.67 days at geostationary orbit[20l. The high energy electrons in event 1 enhanced around Jan 23,after about 2 days,the electrons began to precipitation,it might take about 1 or 2 days for the precipitated electrons to arrive in atmosphere, then affect the local conductivity. Therefore,according to the data analyze,the time from the HEEF enhancement to the ground electric field fluctuations is about 3.7 to 4 days (delay time).

Based on the physical model, our data presentation can be used to explain how the HEEF affects the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near the ground. The event 1 (seen in Fig. 4) shows that the HEEF is a major factor that can affect the electric field of the atmosphere (that has excluded the possibility of wind induction).

The region that high energy electron collide with the atmosphere and lead direct ionization is above $5 0 \mathrm { k m }$ ,however, the X-ray produces ionization down to $2 0 \mathrm { k m }$ (seen in Fig.2). The high energy electrons can affect $J _ { { z } }$ by modulating the conductivity between about $2 0 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ and 60 $\mathrm { k m } ^ { \left[ 5 \right] }$ . The low energy electrons between $1 \ \mathrm { k e V }$ and $1 0 \ \mathrm { k e V }$ cannot excite $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { X }$ -ray, it makes less contribution to modulate the conductivity compared to high energy electrons.

During the storm time, the high energetic electrons precipitating from the inner and outer radiation belts interact with the middle and lower atmosphere. On one hand, the precipitated electrons affect the ionization by produce direct ionization,and on the other hand, the precipitated electrons affect the ionization indirectly by bremsstrahlung radiation[26].The high energy electrons whose initial energy was $E _ { k 1 }$ collided with the atomic nucleus,afterwards, the electrons lost their energy, their energy became $E _ { k 2 }$ and excited $\mathrm { \Delta } X$ -ray $( E _ { k 1 } - E _ { k 2 } = h \nu$ seen in Fig. 7), the X-ray reacted with molecules in the atmosphere as follow:

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { h \upsilon + O _ { 2 }  O + O } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { h \upsilon + O  O ^ { + } + e } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { h \upsilon + N _ { 2 }  N + N } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { h \upsilon + N  N ^ { + } + e } } \end{array}
$$

The processes of equation 4.2 and 4.4 lead to ionization enhancement. The conductivity is strongly modulated by the high energy electron precipitation which accompanies high energy electron density enhancements. The high energy electrons precipitating from the radiation belt with associated $\mathrm { \Delta } X$ -ray bremsstrahlung, they lead to enhanced ionization in the middle and upper atmosphere andconsequently tochemical changes[27-29]，andaffectthelocalconductivityin stratosphere. Therefore,the increases of the electron and ion density caused by the high energy particle precipitation increases the local upper layer atmosphere electrical conductivity[30l.

The HEEF and the $\mathrm { \Delta } X$ -ray enhance the ionization of the stratosphere, increase the conductivity, decrease the resistance （ $R _ { s } ^ { l o c }$ ），thenthe ionosphere-earth current density $J _ { z }$ increased, afterwards,led to the ground electric field enhancement, the schematic of which is shown in Fig. 7.

Fig.7. Schematic showing the mechanism of how the high-energy electron precipitation affects the vertical electric field of the atmosphere. The upward arrow represents an increase; the downward arrow represents a decrease.

Meteorological effects show correlations between changes in the vertical electric field of the atmosphere and the cloud micro-structure. The varied static electric field can affect the electro-scavenging process near droplets, air ions,and aerosol particles. The reconstruction of space charge of clouds due to the precipitation-associated change of the vertical electric filed can lead to potential variations of cloud micro-structure.And it may subsequently affect the ambient temperature evolution which has consequences for weather and climate in different scales. The electric field variations might cause changes in space charge at boundaries of clouds,and there may be several ways in which this affects cloud microphysics,and then produce correlated changes in the weather and climate[51. Generaly, the storms and substorms can be caused by solar activities result in the HEEF enhancement, and then,the high energy electrons precipitate in the atmosphere will excite X-ray by bremssrahlung; afterwards,the precipitated electrons and X-ray increase the ionization of the atmosphere,lead to the local conductivity increase. Finally,the increased conductivity makes the electric field to enhance. Therefore,the space-weather could affect the weather variation and global climate change under some conditions.

Above data presentation and the analysis have demonstrated that the HEEF could modulate the atmospheric vertical electric field. In the meantime,a beter understanding of how GEC influenced by high-energy particles also have been obtained. Qualitative atempts have been made to explain how the HEEF affects the vertical electric field of the atmosphere near ground.The future work is to do a quantitative study on the relation between them,and on how the weather and climate wil respond if the precipitation-associated vertical atmospheric electric field changes.
