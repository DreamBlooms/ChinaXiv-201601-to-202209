Inthis study，an artificial synapse with a sandwich structure of Ta/ethyl viologen diperchlorate $[ \mathsf { E V } ( \mathsf { C l O } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } ] ,$ /triphenylamine-based polyimide (TPA-Pl)/Pt is fabricated directly ona flexible PET substrate and exhibits distinctive history-dependent memristive behaviour,which meets the basic requirements for synapse emulation.Essential synaptic plasticity(including long-term plasticity and short-term plasticity) and some memory and learning behaviours of human beings (including the conversion from short-term memory to long-term memory and the"learning-forgetting-relearning"） have been demonstrated in our device.More importantly，the device stillexhibits the synaptic performance when the surface strain of the device reaches $0 . 6 4 \%$ (or,the bending radius reaches $1 0 \ \mathsf { m m }$ .Moreover,the device wasable to endure100 bending cycles.

# Introduction

All kinds of complex life activities are controlled by the brain, including learning,memory，perception and emotion,which haveattracteda considerable amount of attention in order to investigate the most powerful information processors like the brain.1,² The circuitry of the human brain is composed of a trillion $( 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } )$ neurons,and each neuron connects with others by up to 1000 synapses.' The synapse is believed to underlie learning and memorydue to synaptic plasticity,where synaptic weight,namely the connection strength between neurons,can be continuously modulated by synaptic inputs.4-7Therefore, synapse emulation is considered as a preliminary step towards a highly effective artificial brain neural network.8-12 Previously,a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOs) combined with multiple transistors and capacitors is used to imitate a single synapse, which would increase the energy consumption and complexity of integrated circuits (ICs),13-17 leading to it being hard to obtain high-density neural networks.Therefore,it is necessary to develop a novel component to simulate the function of a single synapse.The memristor is considered to be such a component.18-2o Its resistance can be changed continuously that is very similar to the continuous modulation characteristics of synaptic weight.²1 At present,some memristors have triumphantly realized the function simulation of synapses, including potentiation and depression of synaptic weight long-term/short-term plasticity (LTP/STP) and non-associative/ associative memory,2-28 and so on.However， most of the reported materials for simulating biological synapses are inorganic materials which are fragile22-28 and will not likely work well for flexible electronics，especially for wearable devices.Compared with inorganic materials,organic materials bear advantages of large-area processability,mechanical flexibility,light-weight and low-cost applications.29-31

Recently,some research groups also successfully fabricated artificial synapses using organic materials such as PEDOT: PSS,22,32 PFD-8CN,33 $\mathrm { E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } / B T P A  – F } ^ { 3 4 }$ and chitosan.35 But the organic materials above are still mainly grown on rigid substrates,22,32-34 so the influence of flexural deformation on synaptic performance has not been paid enough attention, although it is important for practical flexible application to measure synaptic performance in the bent state.36

In this study，the polyimide based on triphenylamine (TPA-PI) has been synthesized via condensation polymerization.An artificial synapse with a sandwich structure of $\mathrm { T a / E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } }$ (ethyl viologen diperchlorate)/TPA-PI/Pt is fabricated directly on a flexible PET substrate.TPA-PI can be reversibly changed between insulating and conducting states since triphenylamine units can exhibit rich electrochemical redox behaviour.37,38 In addition, $\mathrm { E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } }$ is a good choice for the counter-reaction of TPA-PI oxidation because it exhibits electrochemically reversible redox properties.39,40 Perchlorate $( \mathrm { C l O } ^ { 4 - } )$ acts as a counter ion to synchronously stabilize the charged form of the oxidized TPA-P1.39-41 In order to improve the migration rate of $\mathrm { C l O ^ { 4 - } }$ ,a polyethylene oxide (PEO) matrix also has been used as a solid electrolyte.39,40,42 Using this single artificial synapse，we have successfully emulated essential synaptic plasticity (including long-term plasticity and shortterm plasticity) and some memory and learning behaviours of human beings (including the conversion from short-term memory to long-term memory and the “learning-forgettingrelearning") process.What is more,we have also studied the synaptic performance it the bent state and the influence of bending radius and bending times on synaptic simulation. These findings show the possibility of utilizing organic materials for the realization of wearable neuromorphic computing systems.

# Experimental section

# Materialsynthesisandcharacterization

N-(4-Aminophenyl) $. N .$ (4-(2,6-di(pyridin-2-yl)pyridine-4-yl) phenyl)- benzene-1,4-diamine (ATATPy)was synthesized according to Scheme1.TPA-PI was synthesized via condensation polymerization of ATATPy with $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -(hexafluoro-isopropylidine)bisphthalic anhydride (6FDA).More specifically，in a $2 5 ~ \mathrm { \ m L }$ three-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a stiring bar, $\mathbf { 0 . 7 5 3 2 } \ \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ $\left( 1 . 4 8 8 \ \mathrm { m m o l } \right)$ ofATATPyand an equal molar ratio of 6FDA were dissolved in $7 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of anhydrous $N \mathrm { \Omega }$ -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) under a nitrogen atmosphere.After $^ \mathrm { ~ 4 ~ h ~ }$ of stirring at room temperature, $3 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of acetic anhydride and $1 . 6 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of pyridine were added to the mixture,after which,the suspension solution was heated for $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .Afterwards,the crude polymeric product was precipitated by adding deionized water.The crude product was then collected by filtrationand dried in vacuo at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Then,the obtained product was subjected to Soxhlet extraction with hot methanol to remove theunreacted monomersand dried in vacuo at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ FT-IR (KBr, $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ） (Fig. S1, $\mathrm { E S I \dag }$ ):1785,1722 $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O } )$ ： $\mathbf { \Omega } ^ { 1 } \mathbf { H } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { N M R }$ （ $\mathrm { ( C D C l _ { 3 } }$ ， ppm) (Fig. S2, $\mathrm { E S I \dag } ^ { \prime }$ ： $\delta ~ 8 . 7 2 \substack { - 8 . 7 6 }$ (br, 6H,ArH), $\delta 7 . 8 9 \substack { - 8 . 0 5 }$ (br,10H,ArH), $\delta 7 . 3 6 \mathrm { - } 7 . 3 9$ (br, 12H, ArH). $M _ { \mathrm { n } } = 1 . 3 0 \times$ ${ 1 0 } ^ { 5 }$ 5 $M _ { \mathrm { w } } = 1 . 4 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ ，Normally,aromatic polyimides are characterized as highly thermally stable polymers.43,44 As predicted, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) suggests that TPA-PI exhibits excellent thermal stability，with no significant weight loss below $5 3 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in air and nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S3,ESIt).

Meanwhile,TPA-PI can exhibit electrochemical redoxbehaviour (Fig.S4,ESIt).Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Shanghai,China) and utilized directly without further purification.

# Device fabrication

The PET substrate was pre-cleaned in acetone,ethanol and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath,in that order and each for 20 minutes,followed by drying in a nitrogen flow.A Pt electrode of $5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ thickness was deposited on the PET substrate by DC reactive magnetron sputtering at room temperature under vacuum $( 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \ \mathbf { P a } )$ . The TPA-PI solution of $5 { \mathrm { ~ m g ~ m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ was prepared via dissolving the polymer powders in cyclohexanone. The pre-prepared solution was filtered by using a micro-filter with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)membrane with a pore size of $0 . 4 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ to remove any undissolved particles.The TPA-PI functional layer was then deposited by spin-coating $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ solution of the polymer on the $\mathbf { P t / P E T }$ substrate at a rotational speed of $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { s }$ and then at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ for $6 0 ~ \mathrm { s } ,$ ,followed by drying and annealing ina vacuum oven at $7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，Theelectrolyte solution $\mathrm { ( E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } }$ and PEO dissolved in acetonitrile) was prepared according to the existing method.'9 The method of fabricatingthe electrolyte layeris similar to the TPA-PI functional layer. A circular Ta electrode witharadius of $5 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and thickness of $6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ was deposited on the electrolyte layer by direct current (DC) reactive magnetron sputtering through a shadow mask.

# Measurements

The current-voltage $\left( I { - } V \right)$ characteristics of the $\mathrm { T a } / \mathrm { E V } ( \mathrm { C l O _ { 4 } } ) _ { 2 } / \mathrm { T P A } -$ PI/Pt device were measured with a Keithley 42oo semiconductor parameter analyser under ambient atmosphere，and the Pt electrode was grounded during electrical measurements. In addition,the device was bent with a home-modified vernier caliper with digital display (the bending radii were previously converted to the direct distances between the two measurement claws of the vernier caliper).

The ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ nuclear magnetic resonance ( $\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H N M R } )$ spectrum was measured at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { M H z } }$ ona Bruker 4OO AVANCE III spectrometer with chloroform $\left( \mathrm { C D C l } _ { 3 } \right)$ assolventand tetramethylsilane (TMS) as reference for the chemical shifts.The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum was recorded on a Thermo Nicolet 67oo FTIR spectrophotometer through dispersing the powder of polymer in a KBr pellet.Number-average $\left( M _ { \mathrm { n } } \right)$ and weight-average $\left( M _ { \mathrm { w } } \right)$ molecular weights were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using linear polystyrene as the molecular weight standards and $N \cdot$ methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, $1 \ \mathrm { m L } \ \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 } .$ ）as the eluent.Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was monitored on a Perkin-Elmer Diamond TG/DTA instrument in a nitrogen atmosphere or an ambient atmosphere with the heating rate of $2 0 \ ^ { \circ } { \bf C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ from $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ to $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and a gas-flow rate of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ . Cyclic voltammetry (CV)measurements were recorded in a O.1 M electrolyte solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate $\left( n { \mathrm { - B u } } _ { 4 } { \mathrm { N C l O } } _ { 4 } \right)$ dissolved in acetonitrile under an argon atmosphere with a scan rate of $5 0 \mathrm { \ m V \ } \mathbf { s } ^ { - 1 }$ ,using the polymer film coated on Pt electrode as the working electrode,platinum gauze and $\mathbf { A g / A g C l }$ $\left( 3 . 8 \mathrm { ~ M ~ K C l } \right)$ as the counter and reference electrodes,respectively.The cross-sectional image of the $\mathrm { E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } / T P A { \cdot } P I }$ bilayer structure was obtained from a Hitachi S-48oo field-emission scanning electron microscope.

# Results and discussion

# Basicelectricalcharacteristics

Using the above mentioned organic redox system,we prepared an artificial synapse device based on $\mathrm { T a } / 3 2 0 \ \mathrm { n m } \ \mathrm { E V } ( \mathrm { C l O _ { 4 } } ) _ { 2 } /$ $2 3 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ TPA-PI/Pt sandwich structure (Fig.1(a) and Fig. S5, ESIt). The $\mathrm { T a } / \mathrm { E V } ( \mathrm { C l O _ { 4 } } ) _ { 2 } / \mathrm { T P A } / \mathrm { - P I } / \mathrm { P t }$ device exhibits a distinctive history-dependent memristive behaviour at room temperature, as plotted in the current-voltage $\left( I { - } V \right)$ characteristics of Fig.1(b). Upon being subjected to four cumulative positive voltage sweeps of $0 \mathrm { { V }  0 . 5 \mathrm { { V }  0 \mathrm { { V } ; } } }$ the device conductance can be increased consecutively,which demonstrates a synaptic potentiation characteristic.Thepotentiation characteristic is caused byelectro chemical oxidation of TPA-PI.Upon electrochemical oxidation of the polymer，a radical cation is formed that markedly increases the conductance of the TPA-PI polymer and the device.22,3,39Afterwards， five cumulative negative voltage sweeps of $\mathrm { ~ 0 ~ V ~ } \to \ - 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } \to \ 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ were applied to the device, while the device conductance can be decreased continuously, which demonstrates a synaptic depression characteristic.The depression characteristic is due to the reduction of the TPA-PI radical cation,which switches the device back to the initial low conductive state.2234,39 In order to clearly illustrate such a changing trend, the curve of sweeping voltage and responding

current versus time was plotted (Fig.1(c)).Compared with the previous works,20,225,26the device exhibits a low operational voltage $( \sim \pm 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V } )$ that can effectively reduce the power consumption.Besides that,a slight rectifying effect is observed. This phenomenon may be attributed to the difference in the work functions of the top/bottom electrode materials and the molecular orbital energy levels of the TPA-PI polymer and the $\mathrm { E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) } _ { 2 }$ ，which influences the charge transport across the $\mathrm { E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } / T P A { \cdot } P I }$ junction under electric fields of different polarity.34 Also,such a rectifying effect contributes to the singledirection transmission of a signal in biological synapses.45,46 Besides that, the potentiation and depression of synaptic weight (the current can be regarded as the synaptic weight) are also observed when 90 consecutive positive voltage pulses with an amplitude of $0 . 5 { \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ and a duration of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ ，andimmediately 90 following consecutive negative voltage pulses with an amplitude of $- 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ and a duration of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ are applied onto the device (Fig.1(d)).The reliability and reversibility of synaptic potentiation/depression characteristics are also evaluated in Fig. S6 (ESIt).

# Synaptic plasticity

In neuromorphic systems,the ability to continuously adjust the synaptic weight,i.e.the potentiation and depression of synapses,is called synaptic plasticity,which is considered as the basic characteristic of human brain learning and memory functions.47,48 In the case of synaptic plasticity,it can be categorized into short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP).49-51 In neuroscience, it is generally thought that STP influences the learning and memory behaviour of the human brain.The nervous system endessly receives huge amounts of information from the outside world, so it is vital to extract useful information from the gigantic quantity of external information.In neural systems,the STP of a

biological synapse isdeemed to play a key role in information extraction.5052AsaommonforofSTinbiological syes, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) reflects that the second postsynaptic response motivated by the pulse is larger than the first one.53-55

Such a PPF behaviour can be mimicked in our artificial synapse device.As shown in the inset of Fig.2(a),when the device receives two continuous voltage stimuli $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { V } , 1 0 \mathrm { m s } )$ ,thecurrent response $\left( I _ { 2 } \right)$ triggered by the second pulse is larger than the first one $\left( I _ { 1 } \right)$ In addition,it can be seen from Fig.2(a) that the ratio $\left( I _ { 2 } / I _ { 1 } \right)$ is determined by the time interval between the two pulses,which can be attributed to the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC).7,20,56 From the inset of Fig. 2(a),we can find the current response gradually decays to a steady value after pulsed bias,which is similar to the behaviour of EPSC ina biological excitatory synapse. In order to more clearly illustrate the EPSC,a single spike $( 0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { V } ;$ $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m s } \mathrm { \ ' }$ isapplied to triggeran EPsC,which may be ascribed to the inertia effect of the ionic flux.20,34 We could see that its intensity graduallydecays to a steadyvalue within about $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ after the spike (Fig.2(b)). The life time of the evoked EPSC is longer than that of the applied pulse,and so contributes to the current overlap when the time interval between the paired pulses is relatively short.Furthermore,a larger overlap of the evoked EPSC would be provoked bya shorter time interval.

In addition to STP,there is another synaptic plasticity LTP which also plays an important role in the synaptic mechanism of learning and memory storage,as LTP means a persistent change to the synaptic weight.57,58 Meanwhile, LTP is influenced by spikerate and spike timing.759-63 Herein, we first investigate the impact of spike rates from $1 \ : \mathrm { H z }$ to $1 0 \mathrm { H z }$ on LTP, as shown in Fig.3(a) and (b).From Fig.3(a),we can see that the more frequent stimuli lead to larger increases of the current.At the spiking rate of $1 \ \mathrm { H z }$ ，the current exhibits no significant increase with the increasing pulse numbers.When the spiking rate reaches $^ { 1 0 \ \mathrm { ~ H z } }$ ，the current is increased from $1 ~ \mu \mathrm { A }$ to $1 . 4 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { A }$ ，This indicates that the present device can also act as a high-pass filter.In order to more clearly analyze the current increases,the relative change of current $\Delta I = I _ { N } - I _ { 1 }$ ,where $I _ { N }$ and $I _ { 1 }$ are the corresponding current after the Nth and 1st pulse,respectively)versus the pulse number is re-plotted in Fig. 3(b). In addition to spike rate, the impact of spike timing onLTP is also explored.Spike timing means the temporal order of the pre-and postsynaptic spikes.Specifically,the polarity of the synaptic weight change depends on the spike timing.When the postsynaptic spike is stimulated instantly after the presynaptic spike (i.e. $\Delta t = t _ { \mathrm { p r e } } - t _ { \mathrm { p o s t } } < 0 ,$ （20 $\Delta t$ is the time interval from the end of the presynaptic spike to the beginning of the postsynaptic spike), the synaptic weightis potentiated.Instead, the synaptic weight gets depressed (Fig. 3(c)). Simultaneously, both depression and potentiation of synaptic weight are adjus table with the time interval.A smaller time interval can result in a heavier variation of synaptic weight $\begin{array} { r } { ( \Delta \mathrm { S W } = \left( I _ { 2 } - I _ { 1 } \right) / I _ { 1 3 } } \end{array}$ ,where $I _ { 1 }$ and $I _ { 2 }$ are the postsynaptic currents measured before and 10 minutes after the paired-spike application,respectively).

# Memory and learning behaviours

In the study of neurobiology,STP and LTP correspond to the short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), respectively,and the memory is considered to be closely related with the strength of synaptic connection or synaptic weight.47,64 For the human memory model, STM decays rapidly with time, so it can only be transient maintained by applying stimulation.65-67 In contrast,LTM can be sustained for a relatively longer time without any followed stimulus because of lasting changes in certain synaptic structures.68,69 Therefore,understanding of the STM and LTM will be beneficial for improving the memory capability.7o,71 Below we show the conversion from STM to LTM by constantly rehearsing the same stimuli.10,7² As illustrated in Fig. 4(a),six pulse voltages (amplitude $\mathbf { \Sigma } = 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V } _ { : }$ duration $\mathbf { \Phi } = \mathbf { \Phi } _ { 1 0 }$ ms，period $= \ 8 0 0 \ \mathrm { \ m s } { \cdot }$ ）anda constant $_ { 0 . 2 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ pedestal voltage are applied to the present $\mathrm { E V ( C l O _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } / T P A { \cdot } P I }$ bilayer (blue curve in Fig.4(a)).The competition effect between spontaneous current weakening after each pulse and overall current strengthening upon the constant pulses is similar to the competition effect of memory loss and memory enhancement in biological systems (red curve in Fig. 4(a)).Another interesting human-learning behaviour can also be observed in the device (Fig. 4(b)-(d)).When 80 continuous stimuli $( 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V } , 1 0 \mathrm { ~ m s } )$ are applied to the device,the normalized current (NC) gradually increases with the number of pulses (Fig. $4 ( \mathsf { b } ) ]$ .When the applied stimuli are removed，the NC spontaneously decays which may be ascribed to the spontaneous diffusion of the TPA-PI radical cation through inter-chain hopping.20,39 The decay trend is slow after the initial fast dropping stage,which is consistent with the forgetting curve of Ebbinghaus in psychology (Fig. 4(c)).73,74 Simultaneously, the NC does not decay to the initial value,but stabilizes at an intermediate value,which demonstrates the existence of LTM in the process of forgetting. When the device is stimulated again with the same stimulus, fewer stimuli are adequate to recover the memory level (Fig. 4(d)) This behaviour is similar to the learning-again (or recaling) process of human beings,that forgotten information can be learnedagain faster.

# Bending measurement

To study the synaptic performance of the device in the bent state，the $\mathrm { T a } / \mathrm { E V } ( \mathrm { C l O _ { 4 } } ) _ { 2 } / \mathrm { T P A } { \cdot } \mathrm { P I } / \mathrm { P t }$ structure was grown on a flexible PET substrate $( 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m m } \times 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ ).Thedevicewas bent along the long-axis direction with a vernier caliper,as shown in Fig.5(a). The surface strain at different curvature radii $( r )$ was estimated (Fig.S7,ESIt).Herein，the synaptic potentiation, synaptic depression and EPSC are studied in the bent state, which is the basis to realize the above synaptic functions and memory behaviours.In Fig.5(b),the device current can be increased and decreased continuously with the cumulative positive voltage sweeps $\left( 0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V } , 3 0 \mathrm { ~ m V } \mathrm { ~ s } ^ { - 1 } \right)$ and negative voltage sweeps $\left( - 0 . 5 \mathrm { V } , 3 0 \mathrm { m } \mathrm { V } s ^ { - 1 } \right)$ when the bending radius is equal to

$1 6 \mathrm { m m }$ (i.e. $r = 1 6 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ).Thisbehaviouris similarto the synaptic potentiation and synaptic depressioncharacteristics in the flat state (Fig.1(b)),which demonstrates the stability of the device. Besides,the EPsC can be evoked bya single pulse $\left( 0 . 5 \mathrm { V } , 1 0 \mathrm { m s } \right)$ at $r = 1 6 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ (Fig.S8,ESIt).Next,we also study the impact of bending radii (flat, $r = 1 6 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ $1 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ， $1 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ， $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ， $8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ $6 \mathrm { m m }$ ， $5 \mathrm { m m }$ ,respectively)ata $0 . 5 \mathrm { V }$ scanning voltage (Fig.5(c)). When the device is bent from the flat state to $r = 1 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，the synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression characteristics exhibit no obvious change (Fig. 5(d)).At the bending radius of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m m }$ ，the potentiation/depression characteristics are still observable,indicating the device's capability of acting as a wearable or even implantable artificial synapse.Yet when the device is bent from $r = 8 \mathrm { m m }$ to $5 \mathrm { m m }$ ,the overall device current and synaptic potentiation/depression characteristics gradually vanish.The optical microscope image reveals that this phenomenon mightbe related with the formation of cracks throughout the thin filmwhich can increase the resistance of the device (Fig. S9, $\mathrm { E S I \dag }$ ).Not only does the bending radius have some influence on the synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression characteristics,but also the number bending cycles.When the bending radius is equal to $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ 1 $r = 1 6 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ )，thesynaptic potentiation and synaptic depression characteristics vanish gradually over 10o bending cycles (Fig. S1o, ESI†).

# Conclusions

To summarize,an organic material based artificial synapse is fabricated directly on a flexible PET substrate,exhibiting dis tinctive history-dependent memristive behaviour that is similar to synaptic potentiation and depression in neurobiology.

Essential synaptic plasticity and some memory and learning behaviours of human beings have been demonstrated, suggesting that our device is promising to meet the basic demands for constructing neuromorphic information storage and processing systems.More importantly，the device still exhibits synaptic potentiation and depression characteristics when bent1oo times with a bending radius of less than $1 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m m }$ .The findings demonstrate that the work,including the measurement of synaptic performance in the bent state and the influence of bending radius and number of bending cycles on synaptic simulation,is favourable for the development ofwearable neuromorphic computing systems.
