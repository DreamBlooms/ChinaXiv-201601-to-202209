In split supersymmetry the gauginos and higgsinos are the only supersymmetric particles possibly accessible at foreseeable colliders like the CERN Large Hadron Collider(LHC) and the International Linear Colider (ILC).In order to account for the cosmic dark matter measured by WMAP, these gauginos and higgsinos are stringently constrained and could be explored at the colliders through their direct productions and/or virtual effects in some processes. The clean environment and high luminosity of the ILC render the virtual effects of percent level meaningful in unraveling the new physics effects.In this work we assume split supersymmetry and calculate the virtual effcts of the WMAP-allowed gauginos and higgsinos in Higgs productions $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ and $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ through WW fusion at the ILC.We find that the production cross section of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ can be altered by a few percent in some part of the WMAP-allowed parameter space,while the correction to the WW fusion process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ is below $1 \%$ . Such virtual effects are correlated with the cross sections of chargino pair productions and can offer complementary information in probing split supersymmetry at the colliders.

# 1.INTRODUCTION

$M _ { 1 }$ and $M _ { 2 }$ being the U(1) and SU(2) gaugino masses, respectively [5,6,7].

Since supersymmetry(SUSY) is so appealing in parti cle physics,cosmology and string theory, its exploration will be a central focus of future collider experiments.If SUSY is at TeV-scale,as required by solving the finetuning problem in particle physics,the LHC expects to discover it or at least reveal some of its fingerprints and then the ILC [1] will zero in on its precision test and map out its detailed structure.However,if the fine-tuning in particle physics works in nature, just like the fine-tuning for the cosmological constant, SUSY may turn out to be a kind of split-SUSY [2], in which all scalar supersymmetric particles (sfermions and additional Higgs bosons) are superheavy and only gauginos and higgsinos are possibly light and accessible at foreseeable colliders like the LHC and ILC.So,if split-SUSY is the true story, the focus of experimental and theoretical studies on SUSY will be gauginos and higgsinos.

To facilitate the collider searches for gauginos and higgsinos in split-SUSY,it is important to examine the possible range of their masses by considering various direct and indirect constraints and requirements. The lightness of gauginos and higgsinos is required by the consideration of the unification of gauge couplings and the explanation of cosmic dark matter. It turns out that the gauge coupling unification does not require gauginos or higgsinos necessarily below TeV scale and they may be as heavy as 10 TeV [3,4].However, the cosmic dark matter measured by WMAP imposes much stronger constraints on the masses of gauginos and higgsinos (except gluinos)，whose lightest mass eigenstates,i.e.,the lightest neutralino and chargino,must be lighter than about 1 TeV under the popular assumption $M _ { 1 } = M _ { 2 } / 2$ with

Note that unlike the neutralinos and charginos, the gluino is not directly subject to the dark matter constraints and its mass constrained by gauge coupling unification can be as high as 18 TeV [3]. Theoretically, the gluino is usually speculated to be much heavier than neutralinos and charginos. So,although the gluino is the only colored particle among gauginos and higgsinos and usually expected to be copiously produced in the gluonrich environment of the LHC [8],it may be quite heavy and thus out of the reach of the LHC and ILC.Therefore,to explore split-SUSY,it is important to examine the neutralinos and charginos.

The neutralinos and charginos in split-SUSY constrainedbythecosmicdarkmattercanbe exploredat the LHC and ILC in two ways. One way is directly looking for their productions,such as chargino pair productions. Our previous analysis [5] showed that the chargino pair production rates at the LHC and ILC are quite large in some part of the WMAP-allowed parameter space, but in the remained part of the parameter space the production rates are unobservably small. The other way to reveal the existence of these particles is through disentangling their virtual effects in some processes which can be precisely measured. It is shown that SUSY may have sizable virtual effects in Higgs boson processes [9] and top quark processes [1O] since they are the heaviest particles in the SM and sensitive to new physics. For split-SUSY, its virtual effects in top quark interactions and Higgsfermion Yukawa interactions are expected to be small since the relevant vertex loops always involve sfermions which are superheavy. So,to reveal the virtual effects of split-SUSY,we concentrate on the gauge interactions of the Higgs boson. Such virtual effects of weakly interacting neutralinos and charginos are usually at percent level and only the high-luminosity $e ^ { + } e ^ { - }$ collider like the ILC can possibly have such percent-level sensitivity. As the discovery machine,the LHC,however，is not expected to be able to disentangle such percent-level quantum effects due to its messy hadron backgrounds. So in this work we investigate the virtual effects of the WMAPallowed split-SUSY in Higgs productions $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ and $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ through WW fusion at the ILC.Note that although the SUSY corrections to these processes were calculated in the literature [11,12],our studies in this work are still necessary since those calculations were performed in the framework of the general minimal supersymmetric model and did not consider the dark matter constraints.

This work is organized in the follows.In Sec.I we calculate the split-SUSY loop contributions to Higgs production $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ and $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ through WW fusion at the ILC.In Sec.III we present some numerical results for the parameter space under WMAP dark matter constraints. The conclusion is given in Sec.IV.Note that for the SUSY parameters we adopt the notations in [13].We assume the lightest supersymmetric particle is the lightest neutralino,which solely makes up the cosmic dark matter.

# II. CALCULATIONS

# A.About split-SUSY

In split-SUSY the Higgs sector at low energy is finetuned to have only one Higgs doublet [2] and the effective spectrum of superparticles contains the higgsinos $\tilde { H } _ { u , d }$ winos $\tilde { W } ^ { i }$ ,bino $\ddot { B }$ and gluino $\tilde { g }$ . The most genenral renormalizable Lagrangian at low energy (say TeV scale) contains the interactions

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { { } } & { { } } & { { { \mathcal { L } } = m ^ { 2 } H ^ { \dagger } H - \displaystyle \frac { \lambda } { 2 } \left( H ^ { \dagger } H \right) ^ { 2 } } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { - \left[ h _ { i j } ^ { u } { \bar { q } } _ { j } u _ { i \epsilon } H ^ { * } + h _ { i j } ^ { d } { \bar { q } } _ { j } d _ { i } H + h _ { i j } ^ { e } { \bar { \ell } } _ { j } e _ { i } H \right. } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { \displaystyle \left. + \frac { M _ { 3 } } { 2 } { \bar { g } } ^ { A } { \bar { g } } ^ { A } + \frac { M _ { 2 } } { 2 } { \bar { W } } ^ { a } { \bar { W } } ^ { a } + \frac { M _ { 1 } } { 2 } { \bar { B } } { \bar { B } } \right. } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { \displaystyle \left. + \mu { \bar { H } } _ { u } ^ { T } \epsilon { \bar { H } } _ { d } + \frac { H ^ { \dagger } } { \sqrt { 2 } } \left( { \bar { g } } _ { u } \sigma ^ { a } { \bar { W } } ^ { a } + { \bar { g } } _ { u } ^ { ' } { \bar { B } } \right) { \bar { H } } _ { u } \right. } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { \displaystyle \left. + \frac { H ^ { T } \epsilon } { \sqrt { 2 } } \left( - { \bar { g } } _ { d } \sigma ^ { a } { \bar { W } } ^ { a } + { \bar { g } } _ { d } ^ { ' } { \tilde { B } } \right) { \bar { H } } _ { d } + { \mathrm { h . c . } } \right] , } } \end{array}
$$

where $\epsilon = i \sigma _ { 2 }$ .Thus the Higgs sector in split-SUSY is same as in the SM except for the additional Higgs couplings to gauginos and higgsinos. Other four Higgs bosons in the MSSM are superheavy and decouple. As is well known,an upper bound of about 135 GeV exists for the lightest Higgs boson in the MSSM [14],which is relaxed to about 150 GeV in split-SUSY [2].

The gauginos (winos and bino） and higgsinos mix into the mass eigenstates called charginos and neutralinos.

The chargino mass matrix is given by

$$
\left( \begin{array} { c c } { { M _ { 2 } } } & { { \sqrt { 2 } m _ { W } \sin \beta } } \\ { { \sqrt { 2 } m _ { W } \cos \beta } } & { { \mu } } \end{array} \right) ,
$$

and the neutralino mass matrix is given by

$$
\left( \begin{array} { c c c c } { { M _ { 1 } } } & { { 0 } } & { { - m _ { Z } s _ { W } c _ { \beta } } } & { { m _ { Z } s _ { W } s _ { \beta } } } \\ { { 0 } } & { { M _ { 2 } } } & { { m _ { Z } c _ { W } c _ { \beta } } } & { { - m _ { Z } c _ { W } s _ { \beta } } } \\ { { - m _ { Z } s _ { W } c _ { \beta } } } & { { m _ { Z } c _ { W } c _ { \beta } } } & { { 0 } } & { { - \mu } } \\ { { m _ { Z } s _ { W } s _ { \beta } } } & { { - m _ { Z } c _ { W } s _ { \beta } } } & { { - \mu } } & { { 0 } } \end{array} \right) ,
$$

where $s _ { W } = \sin \theta _ { W }$ and $c _ { W } = \cos \theta _ { W }$ with $\theta _ { W }$ being the weak mixing angle,and $s _ { \beta } = \sin \beta$ and $c _ { \beta } = \cos \beta$ with $\beta$ defined by $\tan \beta = v _ { 2 } / v _ { 1 }$ ，the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. $M _ { 1 }$ （204号 and $M _ { 2 }$ are respectively the $U ( 1 )$ and $S U ( 2 )$ gaugino mass parameters,and $\mu$ is the mass parameter in the mixing term $- \mu \epsilon _ { i j } H _ { u } ^ { i } H _ { d } ^ { j }$ in the superpotential. The diagonalization of (2） gives two_charginos $\tilde { \chi } _ { 1 , 2 } ^ { + }$ with the convention Mx+ < Mx+；while the diagonalization of (3)givesfourneutraliosX234withtheconvention $M _ { \tilde { \chi } _ { 1 } ^ { 0 } } < M _ { \tilde { \chi } _ { 2 } ^ { 0 } . } < M _ { \tilde { \chi } _ { 3 } ^ { 0 } } < M _ { \tilde { \chi } _ { 4 } ^ { 0 } . }$ .So the masses and mixings of charginos and neutralinos are determined by four parameters: $M _ { 1 }$ ， $M _ { 2 }$ ， $\mu$ and $\tan \beta$

Note that the low energy lagrangian in Eq.(1) should be understood as an effective theory after squarks, sleptons,and heavier Higgs bosons are integrated out.Then, as is discussed in [2]，the Higgs-higgsino-gaugino couplings in Eq.(1)should deviate from the SUSY results shown in the off-diagonal elements of the mass matrices in Eqs.(2)and (3),although such deviation is negligible for numerical results.

In split SUSY the possible channels of Higgs ( $h$ ）pro ductions at the ILC are the Higgs-strahlung process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } ~ \to ~ Z ^ { * } ~ \to ~ Z h$ and $W W$ -fusion process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to$ $\nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ .Both processes will be precisely measured at the ILC if the light Higgs boson $h$ is indeed found at the LHC. Since these processes may be sensitive to new physics, they may serve as a good probe for TeV-scale new physics. Other channels,such as the production of $h$ associated with a CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ and the charged Higgs pair production, cannot occur due to the superheavy $A$ and the superheavy charged Higgs bosons.

# B.Split-SUSY loop effects in Higgs productions at the ILC

The tree-level $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ process is shown in Fig. 1. For the one-loop effects of split SUSY，we need to calculate the diagrams containing the effective $Z$ -boson propagator and several effective vertices shown in Fig. 2. Note that the box diagrams always involve sfermions in the loops and thus drop out since all sfermions are superheavy in split SUSY.In our calculations we use the onshell renormalization scheme [15]. For each effective vertex or $Z$ -boson propagator,we need to calculate several loops plus the corresponding counterterms.For the new rare vertices induced at loop level, such as $\gamma Z h$ , there are no corresponding counterterms. Since in split-SUSY all scalar superparticles are superheavy and decouple from this process,the loops only involve charginos and neutralinos,as shown in Fig.3.

fective vertices shown in Fig. 5.Just like the diagrams shown in Fig. 3,each effective vertex or $W$ -boson propagator contains several loops plus the corresponding counterterms,as shown in Fig.6.

Note that for $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ , in addition to the $W W$ ， fusion contribution shown in Fig. 4,another contribution comes from Higgs-strahlung process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ followed by $Z  \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e }$ . The cross section of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - }  Z h  \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ （204号 peaks at the threshold of $\sqrt { s } = M _ { Z } + M _ { h }$ and then falls rapidly as $\sqrt { s }$ increases,where $\sqrt { s }$ is the center-of-mass (c.m.）energy of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - }$ collision. By contrast，the cross section of $W W$ -fusion process grows monotonously as $\sqrt { s }$ （204号 increases and is far dominant over $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ （20 for $\sqrt { s } \gg M _ { h }$ . In our calculation we assume $\sqrt { s } = 1$ TeV （20 $( \gg M _ { h } )$ ）and thus we only consider $W W$ -fusion process.

Note that in the literature [12] the supersymmetric corrections to this $W W$ -fusion process have been computed,but those calculations focus on the loops involving sfermions (squarks and sleptons).In our calculations in the scenario of split-SUSY,we consider the loops involving charginos and neutralinos,ignoring the loops involving sfermions since all sfermions are superheavy in splitSUSY.So far in the literature such chargino/neutralino loop corrections have not been reported.

Each loop diagram is composed of scalar loop functions [16] which are calculated by using LoopTools [17]. The calculations of the loop diagrams are tedious and the analytical expressions are lengthy,which are not presented here.

# III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In split-SUSY the masses of squarks and the CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ are assumed to be arbitrarily superheavy. As our previous study showed [5],their effects in low energy processes will decouple as long as they are heavier than about 1O TeV. The Higgs mass $M _ { h }$ can be calculated from Feynhiggs [18] and in our calculations we assume the masses of squarks and Higgs boson $A$ are 200 TeV. Among the low-energy parameters of split-SUSY, i.e., $\tan \beta$ ， $M _ { 2 }$ ， $M _ { 1 }$ and $\mu$ ， $M _ { h }$ is sensitive to $\tan \beta$ and a large $\tan \beta$ leads to a large $M _ { h }$ .In our calculations we fix $\tan \beta = 4 0$ since a large value of $\tan \beta$ is favored by current experiments.Our results are not sensitive to $\tan \beta$ in the region of large $\tan \beta$ value and our results are approximately valid for $\tan \beta \gtrsim 1 0$ .With the input values of $\tan \beta$ and squark masses,we get $M _ { h } = 1 2 0$ GeV from Feynhiggs [18].

With the fixed value of $\tan \beta$ ，there remained three split-SUSY parameters: $M _ { 2 }$ ， $M _ { 1 }$ and $\mu$ .We further use the unification relation $M _ { 1 } = 5 M _ { 2 } \tan ^ { 2 } \theta _ { W } / 3 \simeq 0 . 5 M _ { 2 }$ which is predicted in the minimal supergravity model. Thus finally we have two free SUSY parameters. The SM parameters used in our results are taken from [19].

# A.Numerical results without WMAP constraints

In order to show the features of our results,we first present some results without considering the WMAP dark matter constraints.In Fig.7 we show the relative one-loop correction of split-SUSY to the cross section of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ versus the c.m. energy of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - }$ collision for $M _ { 2 } = 4 0 0$ GeV and $\mu = 6 0 0$ GeV.In this case the lightest chargino mass $M _ { \tilde { \chi } _ { 1 } ^ { + } } = 3 8 7$ GeV. We see from Fig. 7 that the corrections are negative and have a peak at $\sqrt { s } = 2 M _ { \tilde { \chi } _ { 1 } ^ { + } }$ due to the threshold effects. The magnitude of the corrections for $\sqrt { s } = 1$ TeV,which will be taken for our following studies,is relatively small.

In Fig. 8 we fix $\sqrt { s } = 1$ TeV and $\mu = 1 0 0$ TeV (note that the scenario with a very large $\mu$ is proposed and argued in [2O])，and by varying $M _ { 2 }$ we show the relative one-loop correction of split-SUSY to the cross section of e+e- → Zh versus the lightest chargino mass M&+ (in this case the chargino mass Mx+ is almost equal to $M _ { 2 }$ due to the superheavy higgsinos). The peak happens at $M _ { \tilde { \chi } _ { 1 } ^ { + } } = \sqrt { s } / 2$ due to threshold effects. When the chargino mass gets heavier than 1 TeV,the corrections becomes very small, showing the decoupling property.

FIG.8: Same as Fig.7,but versus the chargino mass for the c.m.energy of1 TeV.

# B.Numerical results with WMAP constraints

Now we require the lightest neutralinos make up the cosmic dark matter relic density measured by WMAP, which is given by $0 . 0 8 5 < \Omega _ { C D M } h ^ { 2 } < 0 . 1 1 9$ at $2 \sigma$ [21] with $h = 0 . 7 3$ being the Hubble constant.Of course,the direct bounds from LEP experiments [22] need to be also considered,which are:(i) the lightest chargino heavier thanabout lO3 GeV;(ii) the lightest neutralino heavier than about 47 GeV; (ii) $\tan \beta$ larger than 2. Note that the LEP bound $\tan \beta > 2$ is obtained from the search limit of the lightest Higgs boson for squarks below 1 TeV. Such a bound may be relaxed in split-SUSY because of superheavy squarks.

We then perform a scan over the parameter space of $M _ { 2 }$ and $\mu$ .The $2 \sigma$ allowed region is shown in Fig. 2 of Ref.[5]. (Note that in [5] we used the one-year WMAP data $0 . 0 9 4 < \Omega _ { C D M } h ^ { 2 } < 0 . 1 2 9$ . The allowed region with one-year WMAP data is approximately same as that with three-year WMAP data).

![](images/b8360aea5b9a7e11fbfadccfec5889068582ce823a88d5ca6774b298eae97da2.jpg)  
FIG.9: The shaded areas are the $2 \sigma$ region of split-SUSY parameter space allowed by the WMAPdark matter measurement in the planes of the chargino pair production rate (upper panel) and the one-loop correction of split-SUSY to the cross section of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ (lower panel) versus the chargino mass.

In Fig. 9 we show the one-loop correction of splitSUSY to the cross section of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ (lower panel) with comparison to the chargino pair production rate (upper panel). The chargino pair production rate is calculated at tree-level,as in our previous work [5].

From Fig. 9 we see that when the chargino is lighter than about 3Oo GeV, the chargino pair production rate at the ILC is large and the corresponding virtual effects in $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ are positive. When the chargino gets heavier,the chargino pair production rate at the ILC drops rapidly. Of course,when the chargino is heavier than 500 GeV,beyond the threshold of the ILC (with c.m. energy of 1 TeV),the charginos cannot be pair produced.Then it is interesting to observe that for a chargino between 500 and 60o GeV,although the ILC cannot produce chargino pairs,the virtual effects in $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ can still reach a couple of percent in magnitude and thus may be observable at the ILC with a high integrated luminosity. Finally,when the chargino is heavier than about 6oo GeV, it will probably remain unaccessible because both the chargino pair production rates and the virtual effects are very small due to the decoupling property of SUSY.

Note that for $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ we numerically compared our results with the full one-loop corrections given in [11](we thank the authors of [11] for giving us their fortran code).In our calculations we only considered the chargino and neutralino loops,while in their calculations the sfermion loops are also considered besides the chargino and neutralino loops. In principle,their results in the limit of superheavy sfermions should approach to our results.We found that although their fortran code does not work well for superheavy sfermions (say above 1O TeV)due to the limitation of numerical calculation, for a given point in the parameter space our results agree well with those by using their fortran code withall sfermions above1 TeV.

![](images/5c9a8e62425468ab92f692c426789790caf1a4ee117d77e1755f513345cd1c5f.jpg)  
FIG.1O:Same as the lower panel of Fig.9,but for the $W W$ fusion process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$

The one-loop correction of split-SUSY to the cross section of $W W$ -fusion process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ is very small in magnitude,below one percent，as shown in Fig. 10. Even with a high luminosity the ILC can hardly reveal such a small deviation from the measurement of this process.The reason why the virtual effects in the $s$ -channel process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ is much larger in magnitude than in the $t$ -channel process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ may be that for the $s$ -channel process the virtual sparticles (charginos and neutralinos） in the loops could be more energetic and cause larger quantum effects.

Anyway, such virtual effects of split-SUSY, no matter large or small in magnitude,could be informative and complementary to the real sparticle productions in probing split-SUSY at colliders. For example, if split-SUSY turns out to be the true story and the chargino pair production is observed with the chargino mass around 150 GeV at the ILC,then we know from Figs.9 and 10 that the virtual effects of SUSY must be about $2 . 5 \%$ for process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ and $- 0 . 1 \%$ for WW-fusion process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ ：

# IV.CONCLUSION

In split supersymmetry, gauginos and higgsinos are the only supersymmetric particles possibly accessible at foreseeable colliders like the LHC and the ILC.In order to account for the cosmic dark matter measuerd by WMAP, the parameter space of the gauginos and higgsinos in split supersymmetry are stringently constrained,which can be explored at the LHC and the ILC through direct productions and the virtual effects of these gauginos and higgsinos. The clean environment of the ILC may render the virtual effects of percent level meaningful in probing the new physics.In this work we assumed split supersymmetry and calculated the virtual effects of the WMAP-allowed gauginos and higgsinos in Higgs productions $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ and $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ through WW fusion at the ILC. We found that the production cross section of $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ can be altered by a few percent in some part of the WMAP-allowed parameter space,while the correction to the WW fusion process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to \nu _ { e } \bar { \nu } _ { e } h$ is below $1 \%$ ：

Such virtual effects are correlated with the cross sections of chargino pair productions and thus can offer complementary information in probing split supersymmetry at the colliders. Our results indicate that if the lightest chargino is in the light region allowed by the WMAP dark matter (say below 20O GeV),then at the ILC and LHC the chargino pair production rates are large and the virtual effects of charginos/neutralinos in the process $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ at the ILC can reach a few percent,both of which may be measurable and cross-checked.An interesting observation is that for a chargino between 500 and 600 GeV,although the ILC(with c.m. energy of 1 TeV)cannot produce chargino pairs,the virtual effects in $e ^ { + } e ^ { - } \to Z h$ can still reach a couple of percent in magnitudeand thus may be observable at theILC with a high integrated luminosity. The WMAP-allowed region with the chargino heavier than about 6oo GeV will most likely remain unaccessible because both the chargino production rates and the virtual effects are very small due to the decoupling property of SUSY.
