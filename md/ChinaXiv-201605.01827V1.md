# Cellulose synthesis genes CESA6 and CSl1 are important for salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis

Soil salinity is a widespread abiotic stress constraint threatening agricultural production，as it severely inhibits growth and development of crops.Several salt stress signaling pathways have been discovered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana,which include components for sensing the stress， transmitting the signal and regulating the downstream genes (Deinlein et al. 2014； Julkowska and Testerink 2o15). In nature，plant roots directly encounter heterogeneous soils and therefore their responses to saline environments require dynamic changes in growth,a process in which plant cell walls play important roles (Tenhaken 2015). However， the molecular mechanisms underlying cell wall remodeling under stress conditions are still unclear.

Toidentify salt stress tolerance determinants,an Ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) screening was carried out in the Arabidopsis bzip6o(Fujita et al.2oo7)mutant background. One of the salt hyper-sensitive mutants,she1,grew relatively normally in the $_ { 1 / 2 }$ MS medium; however,she1 mutants were more sensitive to mild salt stress compared to the control (Figures 1A,S1A). In contrast to shoot growth, root growth of she1 was more significantly inhibited by salt stress;swollen and larger roots were observed with salt-stressed she1 plants (Figure S1B).To investigate whether the salt hypersensitive phenotype of she1 is attributed to ion toxicity or osmotic stress,she1 seedlings were treated with various concentrations of NaCl,KCl,LiCl and mannitol.It turned out that she1 mutants were hyper-sensitive to both ionic and osmotic stresses in roots (Figure S2A-D).

SHE1 was isolated as a non-sense mutation in locus AT5G6474o,leading to a conversion of R27 to a premature stop codon (Figure S3;Table S1). AT5G6474o encodes a wellknown cellulose synthase CESA6 (Fagard et al. 2ooo).To confirm that SHE1is CESA6,two alleles of cesa6 mutants,prc1-1 and ixr2-1(Figure S3),were obtained and their sensitivities to salt stress were evaluated.It was found that prc1-1 had a similar phenotype as she1 did (Figure 1A).The irx2-1 mutant might not be a knock-out mutant since irx2-1 has a mild hypocotyl elongation phenotype when growing in the dark (Desprez et al.2oo2).To further confirm that she1 is allelic to prc1-1,she1 was crossed to prc1-1,and it was found that all successfully crossed F1 plants were salt hyper-sensitive (Figure S4A,B).The salt-sensitive phenotype of she1 was not dependent on bZIP6o mutation (Figure S4C). Under mild salt stress conditions,more lateral rootswere observed in either she1 or she1 wild-type(wt) plants,which was related to auxin,since theauxin effluxinhibitor1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid(NPA) dramatically inhibited lateral root emergence in the she1 (wt) plants (Figure S5A,B).These results indicated that the cellulose synthase gene CESA6/SHE1 is important for salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.

To understand why she1 was hyper-sensitive to salt stress, roots were stained with various chemicals.When the wt and cesa6 mutant plants were grown on normal medium, propidium iodide(Pl） nicely outlined root cells in the elongation zone;when a low concentration of NaCl was present in the growth medium,Pl staining was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in root cells of she1(wt) and prc1-1 mutants (Figure 1B),indicating that CESA6 mutation affects membrane integrity under salt stress conditions.The meristematic or elongation zone of roots was stained with fluorescein diacetate (FDA)，which is an indicator of cell viability.The low concentration of NaClin the growth medium did not affect the esterase activity in roots of the wt but it dramatically decreased the esterase activity in roots of the she1 (wt) and prc1-1 mutants,especially in the elongation zone (Figure 1C). To examine potential cell wall defects, roots of wt and cesa6 mutants were stained with calcofluor (Fagard et al.2ooo). Longitudinal sections under confocal microscopy showed that mild salt stress did not affect the signal intensity in the wt,but decreased the fluorescence in the elongation zone of she1 (wt) and prc1-1 mutants in the root vasculature regions (Figure 1D).These results support that CESA6 plays major roles in cellulose deposition in roots undersalt stress conditions,whichis important for salt stress tolerance.

Tocheck whether cellulose deposition defects affect salt stress gene expression，quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed.Eight salt stress up-regulated genes were selected from the top list of a previous microarray experiment (Liu et al.2oo7). It turned out that the degree of up-regulation of five genes by salt stress were much higher in roots of the she1(wt) plants than those that in the wild-type plants at least at one time point (Figure 1E).These results indicate that mutations in CESA6 confer highersalt stress sensitivityandaffect the expression of downstream stress responsive genes.Even though genes encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism, lignification and formation of very long chain fattyacids were up-regulated by salt stress in she1 roots,root growth of she1 displayed a higher degree of inhibition by salt stress,probably due to its defect in cellulose synthesis.

Cellulose is synthesized by a large，plasma membranetethered cellulose synthase complex (CSC） that can be visualized as a hexameric rosette structure (Hill et al.2014). There are 10 cellulose synthase (CESA) genes in the Arabidopsis genome (Richmond and Somerville 2000). CESA1,CESA3 and CESA6 are involved in primary cell wall synthesis,while CESA4,CESA7 and CESA8 are required for secondary cell wall synthesis (Endler and Persson 2011). Previously，it was reported that the Arabidopsis cesa1/rsw1 mutant is salt sensitive;we found both she1 and prc1-1 roots are hyper-sensitive to salt stress, suggesting that CESA6 plays a similar role to CESA1/RSW1(Kang etal.2oo8) in Arabidopsis roots under salt stress conditions.Both CESA1 and CESA6 single mutants have a modest phenotype under normal growth conditions,which could be explained by the functional redundancy with other CESA genes.Salt stress may affect the activities of CESA and thus knocking out either CESA6 or CESA1 confers salt stress sensitivity. CESA6 interacts with cellulose synthase-interactive protein1(CSl1; Gu et al.2o10),a large plant-specific protein that mediates the connection between CSC and cortical microtubules to guide cellulose synthesis at the plasma membrane (Li et al.2o12). Salt and osmotic stresses rapidlyaffect microtubule assembly (Komis et al.2oo2)，indicating that the CSC may be dynamically regulated in response to prolonged salt stresses in plants in which the CSl1 protein may have roles in reassembling the complex for cellulose synthesis.In our genetic screening,we isolated another Arabidopsis salt hyper-sensitive mutant, she2 (Figures 1A,S6),in which CSl1/POM2 was mutated (Figure S7; Table S2).she2 and another two csi1 mutant alleles (csi1-2 and csi1-3）were all hyper-sensitive to salt stress (Figure 1A). Disruption of the link between CSC and cortical microtubules mayaffect the synthesis/deposition of celluloseat the plasma membrane under prolonged salt stress conditions.Taken together our results suggest that regulation of the cellulose synthase complex is very important for cellulose synthesis, therefore also for root growth under salt stress conditions.

Figure1. Continued.

Previously，a cellulose synthase-like protein，SOS6,was demonstrated to confer osmoticstress tolerancein Arabidopsis (Zhu et al.2o1o).However, the sos6-1 mutant has a modest defect in cell wall formation,and both shoots and roots of the sos6-1 mutant are sensitive to salt-induced osmotic stress (Zhu et al.2o1o). These contrasting results suggest that SHE1 and SHE2 play distinct roles from SOS6 in response to salt stress. Thus,our forward genetic analysis in Arabidopsis has revealed thatsustained cellulose synthesis conferred by CESA6 and CSl1is important for salt stress tolerance.
