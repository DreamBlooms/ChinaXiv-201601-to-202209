ABSTRACT: A series of 2-aminopyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized as highly selective $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitors. One of the most promising compounds 2n tightly bound $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ with a ${ \mathrm { K } } _ { d }$ value of $3 { \cdot } 3 \mathrm { n M }$ and potently inhibited its enzymatic activity with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of ${ \bf \Gamma } _ { 2 . 6 \ n M }$ ,but completely spared $\mathrm { F G F R } / 2 / 3$ .The compound selectively suppressed proliferation of breast cancer cells harboring dysregulated $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ signaling with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $\mathbf { 0 . 3 8 \mu M }$ Furthermore, 2n exhibited extraordinary target specificity in a Kinome-wide screen against $4 6 8$ kinases, with ${ \sf S } ( _ { 3 5 } )$ and S(io) selectivity scores of o.o1 and o.oo7 at 1.0 $\mu \mathrm { M }$ ,respectively.

The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR） family comprises four functional members (i.e.，FGFRi, FGFR2, FGFR3,FGFR4),which consist of a conserved extracellular ligand-binding domain，a single transmembrane region and a cytosolic region with a split tyrosine kinase domain.' ² FGFRs are high affinity receptors for the fibroblast growth factors(FGFs) which includes i8 members.' FGF/FGFR signaling is tightly regulated by ligand specificity,and temporal and spatial expression of the signaling components,and is involved in many fundamental biological processes,such as metabolism，embryonic develop ment and adult tissue homeostasis.2-3

$\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ is mainly expressed in liver, lung, lymphoid and breast tissues and specifically utilizes endocrine FGFi9 as the intracellular ligand.4-5 Upon binding with a complex formed by $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ and its co-receptor,transmembrane $\beta$ Klotho protein,4 FGFRi9 promotes receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation and activation of the signaling pathway,which plays significant roles in regulation of bile acid homeostasis,and maintenance of glucose and protein metabolism.7FGFR4 and/or FGFi9 aberrations (i.e.,amplification,gene fusion or mutation） have been recently detected in a variety of human cancers.For instance,FGF19 is amplified in approximate $1 5 \%$ of breast cancer, and high expression of FGFi9 was closely correlated to poor prognosis of the disease.’ Various genetic alterations of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ such as amplification, point mutation" and single nucleotide polymorphism,'² were also detected in human breast tumor tissues.It has been demonstrated that silencing of FGFi9/FGFR4 signaling by siRNA or introduction of an anti-FGFi9 antibody potently suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis of triple-negative breast cancer cells,, 13 offering promise in a disease setting that scarcely benefits from currently available therapies.14 A synergistic interaction was also observed between $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ signaling blockade and doxorubicin chemotherapy.13，15 Collective evidence also suggests that FGFi9/FGFR4 signaling is an oncogenic driver in a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.In an analysis of 28i HCC patients,approximately $4 8 \%$ of the tumors expressed FGFi9,which was associated with larger tumor size,more advanced stage and early recurrence. In addition,about $30 \%$ of HCC samples tested display increased expression of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 } ^ { \mathrm { n } _ { 7 } }$ and $2 5 \%$ overexpress $\beta$ -Klotho protein.' These data collectively indicate that targeting the FGFi9/FGFR4 signaling pathway may provide a new promising strategy for the management of a defined subgroup of cancer patients.19,20

Anumberof small moleculeFGFRinhibitorswithdifferent selectivity profiles have been developed into clinical investigation for the management of FGFR-driven human cancers.2' Unfortunately，hyperphosphatemia and tissue calcification are common “on-target”clinical adverse effects for most of the drugs investigated,22-23 due to their strong inhibitory activity against FGFRi and $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 3 }$ ,blocking FGF23-mediated signaling.24 Given the fact that the FGFR family share significant sequence homology in their kinase domains (Figure iA),it isa considerable challenge to develop selective $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitors over the other family members.Most recently，BLU993l (1,Figure iB) was discovered as the first selective $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitor.The structure-based design of this molecule involved the covalent targeting of a unique Cysteine 552 (Cys552)residue in the hinge region of the receptor (Figure iC).25 The compound exhibited extraordinary target specificity and demonstrated significant anti-proliferative activity against a panel of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with activated FGFR4 signaling. Moreover， the compound also

demonstrated promising in vivo effcacy in several xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HCC.25 Most recently, BLU554,a structurally related derivative of inhibitor1,was advanced into early stage clinical investigation (clinical trial ID NCTo25o8467). The clinical report of the compound is eagerlyawaited.Nevertheless, it is still highly valuable to identify new selective FGFR4 inhibitors for anticancer drug discovery.Herein,we describe the design,synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 2-aminopyrimidine derivatives as new selective $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitors.2

The X-Ray co-crystal structure of compound 1 with FGFR4 revealed that the compound binds with the ATPbinding pocket of the receptor, forming a critical covalent bond with Cys552 (Figure iC). It was also shown that $C _ { \mathrm { a } }$ ${ \mathrm { C } } _ { \mathrm { b } } ,$

$C _ { \mathrm { c } }$ and $C _ { \mathrm { d } }$ atoms in this inhibitor were in an almost coplanar configuration (Figure $\mathrm { { \bf 1 8 / C } ) }$ ,and there were no obvious direct interactions between the phenyl ring A (Figure iB) and the protein. It is well-known that the lowest energy conformation of n-butane is an anti-form configuration where the dihedral angle of the four carbon atoms is approximately $\pm { 1 8 0 } ^ { \circ }$ (Figure iB).²7 Thus,an n-butane-like moiety might be utilized as a bioisostere of the phenyl ring A moiety to mimic the conformation of compound 1. Based on this hypothesis,a series of 2-aminopyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized (Figure iB). Encouragingly,a preliminary computational study suggested that compound 2a,which harbors a methyleneoxyl moiety to potentially mimic the conformation of the parent compound 1, nicely bound into the ATP-binding pocket of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ with a similar mode to that of compound 1 (Figure iD). The warhead acrylamide is predicted to covalently react with the sulfhydryl side chain of Cys552,which derives the paralog selectivity.25 The 2-aminopyrimidine core forms two pairs of hydrogen bonds with the backbone amino and carbonyl group of Ala553，respectively.The tetra-substituted phenyl group,which adopts an almost perpendicular orientation to the 2-aminopyrimidine core, makes favorable van der Waals contacts with the hydrophobic back pocket of the ATP binding site，with one methoxyl forming a hydrogen bond with the backbone carboxamide NH group of Asp63o.It is also noteworthy that compound 2a possesses less aromatic ring count and higher $\mathrm { F s p } ^ { 3 }$ value than that of compound 1,which might benefit its drug-like physico-chemical properties.28-29

\*Reagents and conditions: (A) $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 } C O _ { \scriptscriptstyle 3 } ,$ （20 $\mathrm { B u } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N } { + } { \cdot } \mathrm { I } { - }$ ,DMF, $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 2.0 h; (B) ${ \mathrm { P d } } ( \mathrm { O A c } ) _ { 2 }$ ，XantPhos, $\mathrm { C s } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 3 }$ ，100 $\mathrm { { ^ \circ C } }$ , Overnight; (C) TFA,DCM,rt, Overnight;(D) Acryloyl chloride,DIEA, dry DCM, $\mathbf { o } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,2.0 h.R: substituted phenyl.

The designed inhibitors were readily prepared by using a Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction as the key step(Scheme i).3° Briefly，commercially available 2- chloropyrimidin $^ { \cdot 5 }$ -ol was treated with different substituted benzyl bromides giving the corresponding intermediates5 through a nucleophilic substitution reaction.Compounds 5 were coupled with various Boc-protected ophenylenediamines under palladium catalysis to afford the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling products,which were deprotected to produce the arylamines 7. Intermediates 7 were reacted with acryloyl chloride to produce the designed molecules 2a,2c-2g and 2k-2l with good to moderate yields.The other designed inhibitors were synthesized by utilizing a similar protocol (Supporting Information).

Kinase inhibitory activities of the designed compounds against $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ and the family members $\mathrm { F G F R } 1 / 2 / 3$ were evaluated by usinga well-established FRET-based $Z ^ { \prime }$ -Lyte assay.²5The firstreported selective $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitor1and a $\mathrm { F G F R } 1 / 2 / 3$ inhibitor FIIN $\cdot$ were used as a positive control to validate the screening conditions. Under our assay conditions，it exhibited strong inhibitory potency against FGFR4 with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $6 . 0 \ \mathrm { n M }$ ，further to this compound 1 was significantly less potent against $\mathrm { F G F R 1 } / 2 / 3$ ， with our data comparing favorably to the reported data.25

Whereas, the pan FGFRs inhibitor FIIN-1 exhibited $\cdot$ values of 3.6, 2.3, 6.o and 261.3 nM against FGFR1, FGFR2, $\cdot$ and FGFR4, respectively. We were delighted to find that our first designed compound 2a potently suppressed the enzymatic activity of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of 11.1 nM,which was only $^ 2$ -fold less potent than the positive control 1, yet entirely spared $\mathrm { F G F R } / 2 / 3$ with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values $>$ 10,000 nM (Table 1). Investigation also suggested that the methyleneoxyl linker in compound za could be replaced by a methyleneamino moiety $\mathbf { \left( { \pmb { 2 } } { \bf { b } } \right) }$ to demonstrate slightly decreased $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ suppression with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of 43.4 nM, while maintaining the paralog selectivity. Compound 2a harbored a methyl substitution at the $3 ^ { ' }$ ：position, which was adopted from the original parental molecule 1 and was considered to be important for the selective inhibition against $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ （2号 Thus,we first investigated the potential impact of the methyl substituent position on the paralog sparing $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibition.It was shown that this substitutent position indeed had a great influence on the target inhibitory botencyand paralog selectivity.When the methyl group was shifted to the ${ } _ { 6 } ?$ position, the resulting molecule 2c demonstrated a total loss of all FGFR inhibitory activity.The $5 ^ { \prime }$ -methyl substituted compound 2d exhibited slightly increased $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitory potency with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ ,but its selectivity was decreased due to increased inhibition of FGFRi. Whereas,a $4 ^ { ' - }$ methyl substitutent (2e) resulted in a slight decrease in $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitory potency and similar FGFRi inhibition as that observed in the $5 ^ { ' }$ -position $( \bf { 2 d } )$ . Although removal of the methyl group barely affected the $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibition potency， the resulting molecule 2f displayed obviously improved suppression against both FGFRi and FGFR2 with $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of 431.0 and $_ { 3 1 1 . 9 ~ \mathrm { n M } }$ ，respectively， suggesting significant loss of its target specificity. Thus,the results collectively suggested that $3 ^ { ' - }$ substitution is an optimal strategy for designing new selective $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitors. Further investigation also revealed that the $3 ^ { ' - }$ position is well tolerated to a variety of substituted groups such as ethyl $\mathbf { \Sigma } ( \mathbf { z } \mathbf { g } )$ ,methoxyl $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { 2 } \mathbf { h } )$ ,chloro- $( \mathbf { 2 1 } )$ and trifluoromethyl $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { z m } )$ moieties which demonstrated potent and paralog-selective inhibition of FGFR4. Encouragingly,the $3 ^ { ' }$ -chloro substituted analogue 2l exhibited an obviously improved $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibition potency with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $_ { 3 . 8 \ \mathrm { n M } }$ ，but retained excellent selectivity against $\mathrm { F G F R } { \mathrel { \left/ { \vphantom { \mathrm { F G } } } \right. \kern - delimiterspace } } _ { 2 } / _ { 3 }$ at a high concentration of io,ooo nM.Not surprisingly, the $3 ^ { ' }$ -fluro substituted compound 2k displayed a similar potency and selectivity profile to that of the $3 ^ { ' }$ -unsubstituted molecule 2f. Notably, increases in size of a $3 ^ { ' }$ -alkoxy group resulted in stepwise loss of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitory potency (compare 2h, 2i and 2j). Our investigation suggested that substitution at the $5 ^ { \prime } -$ position of the molecules could retain strong $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibition.Thus,several $3 ^ { ^ { \prime } } , 5 ^ { ^ { \prime } - }$ disubstituted compounds, i.e.,2n,2o,2p,were also designed and synthesized.These displayed potent and selective suppression of FGFR4.Particularly, the $3 ^ { ' }$ -chloro- ${ \boldsymbol { \cdot } } { \boldsymbol { 5 } } ^ { \prime }$ -fluoro-analogue 2n which exhibited the best $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitory activity with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $_ { 2 . 6 \ \mathrm { n M } }$ ， $_ 2$ -fold more potent than compound i.Compound 2n also displayed an obviously improved paralog selectivity over the reported inhibitori.Further investigation also revealed that warhead acrylamide was crucial for potent $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibition.Replacement of the acrylamide with an $\alpha ,$ （20号 $\beta$ -saturated propionamide moiety (2q) caused a totally abolishment of FGFR inhibition.It is generallyaccepted that a benzyloxy group possesses a potential

Modification was also conducted on the tetra-substituted phenyl moiety which was predicted to approach the hydrophobic back pocket of the ATP binding site.It was shown that the tetra-substitution was critical for the molecules to demonstrate strong $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibition.Removal of one or more substituents caused significant potency loss against $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ For instance,removal of a methoxyl group (2s) resulted ina 6.3- fold potency loss,whereas deletion of a chloro- group (t) reduces potency $^ 3$ -fold.The other chloro- or methoxyl deleted compounds (2u-2z) displayed a 6.o to i22-fold loss ofpotency. Thus,compounds 2a,2h,2l,2o,and 2n stood outas representatives for further investigation due to their strong $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitory potency and extraordinary paralog specificity.

Compound 2n selectively targets $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ (A) Compound 2n dose-dependently inhibits the activation of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ and downstream proteins in MDA-MB-453 cells with $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 } ^ { \mathrm { Y } _ { 3 } 6 _ { 7 } C }$ .The cells were treated with or without compound 2n for 4h at the indicated concentrations,respectively. Cells were then harvested for Western blot analysis.(B） KinomeScan kinase selectivity profile for compound 2n. Compound 2n was profiled at a concentration of 1.0 $\mu \mathrm { M }$ against a diverse panel of $4 6 8$ kinases by DiscoveRx.

Taking compound 2n as an example, the strong $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibition of the compounds was further validated by investigating its inhibition of the activation of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ and downstream signaling partners in MDA-MB-453 cells harboring an activating $\mathrm { \bar { F G F R 4 } } ^ { \mathrm { Y 3 6 7 C } }$ mutation (Figure 2A)." It was shown that the compound diminished the phosphorylation of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ and inhibited the activation of downstream FRS2, $\mathrm { E R K } _ { 1 / 2 }$ and AKT in a dose-dependent manner,while the total amount of corresponding proteins re mained unchanged as determined by western blot analysis The phosphorylation of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ ， $\mathrm { E R K } _ { 1 / 2 }$ and FRS2 was almost totally abolished after a treatment of $\mathbf { 0 . 0 3 \ \mu M }$ of compound 2n,although its effect on p-Akt was less obvious.

The binding affinity of compound 2n for FGFR4 was also determined by usingan active-site-dependent competition binding assay (DiscoveRx Corporation, San Diego,USA). It was shown that compound 2n tightly bound to the ATPbinding site of the kinase with a binding constant $( \mathbb { K } _ { d } )$ value of $3 { \cdot } 3 \ \mathrm { \ n M }$ ，validating its strong kinase inhibition against $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ .We further profiled the target specificity of this compound against a panel of $4 6 8$ kinases (including 403 nonmutated kinases）using the DiscoveRx screening platform at a concentration of i.o $\mu \mathrm { M }$ ，which was about 30o times higher than its ${ \mathrm { K } } _ { d }$ value with $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ .The results revealed that 2n demonstrated impressive target specificity with S(io) and $\mathrm { S } ( 3 5 )$ selectivity scores of o.oo7 and o.01 at 1.0 $\mu \mathrm { M }$ ,respectively(Table $S _ { 2 }$ ).For instance,2n showed almost $100 \%$ competition rate $( 9 9 . 5 \%$ inhibition, $c \mathrm { t r l } \% =$ 0.5) with $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ at $\mathbf { 1 . O \mu M }$ ,and only showed obvious binding to a very small portion of the kinases investigated.The main “off-target” hits included calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase ID (CAMKiD, $9 4 { \cdot } 7 \%$ inhibition), G-protein coupled receptor kinase $^ 4$ 0 $\mathrm { \ G R K } _ { 4 }$ ， $9 2 . 8 \%$ inhibition),and SRSF Protein Kinase $^ 3$ (SPRK3, $8 8 \%$ inhibition).

The $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values were determined using CCK8.Data are mean values $\pm$ standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.

The growth inhibitory effects of the compounds 2a, 2h, 2l,2o,and 2n were evaluated against a panel of breast cancer cell lines (Table 2)．MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells predominantly express a mutated form of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ $\mathrm { F G F R } \dot { 4 } ^ { \mathrm { Y } _ { 3 } 6 _ { 7 } \mathrm { C } }$ ,which causes spontaneousreceptordimerization and constitutive activation in a ligand-independent manner." Moreover, $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 } \mathrm { ^ { Y _ { 3 } 6 7 C } }$ had been identified as an important driver gene for the proliferation of MDA-MB453 cells. On the another hand,MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells harbor low level of $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ and serve as negative control cell models to investigate the target specificity of the inhibitors.'’ It was shown thatalmostall of the selected $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitors exhibited promising antiproliferative activity against MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells with similar potencies to that of inhibitor1.However, none of them displayed obvious cell growth inhibition against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-23i breast cancer cells expressing low levels of FGFR4.For instance,compound 2n potently inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $\mathbf { 0 . 3 8 \mu M }$ ,which is compa rable to that of compound 1,but was unable to suppress the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-23i cancer cells at a 10 $\mu \mathrm { M }$ concentration. These data further supported the strong and selective antagonism of the new inhibitors against FGFR4.It is also noteworthy that all of the new inhibitors appear to display better target specificity than the original compound 1 in the cell based assays,which is consistent with the data from the biochemical kinase inhibition assays.Further investigation also demonstrated that compound 2n dose-dependently induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-453 cells (Figure S2).

In summary,a series of 2-aminopyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized as highly selective $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ inhibitors.These compounds potently suppressed $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ activity with low nanomolar $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values and excellent isotype selectivity. One of the most promising compounds 2n tightly bound with $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ with a $\mathrm { K _ { d } }$ value of $3 { \cdot } 3 ~ \mathrm { { n M } }$ and potently inhibited its enzymatic activity with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $_ { 2 . 6 \ \mathrm { n M } }$ ，but completely spared $\mathrm { F G F R 1 } / 2 / 3$ .The compound selectively suppressed proliferation of breast cancer cells harboring dysregulated $\mathrm { F G F R } _ { 4 }$ signaling with an $\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of $\mathbf { o } . 3 8 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ .Furthermore,it exhibited extraordinary target specificity in a Kinome-wide screen against $4 6 8 ~ \mathrm { { k i ^ { - } } }$ nases,with S(io) and $\mathrm { S } ( 3 5 )$ selectivity scores of o.oo7 and 0.01 at 1.0 $\mu \mathrm { M }$ ，respectively. Compound 2n may serve as new lead compound for future anticancer drug discovery. Further structural optimization of the compound and in vivo antitumor efficacy investigation are ongoing.
