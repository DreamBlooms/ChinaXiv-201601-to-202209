A natural model of realizing the effective supersymmetry is presented. Two sets of the Standard Model-like gauge group $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ are introduced, where $G _ { i } = S U ( 3 ) _ { i } \times S U ( 2 ) _ { i } \times U ( 1 ) _ { i }$ ,which break diagonally to the Standard Model gauge group at the energy scale $M \sim 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ GeV. Gauge couplings in $G _ { 1 }$ are assumed much larger than that in $G _ { 2 }$ .Gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking is adopted. The first two generations (third one) are charged only under $G _ { 1 }$ ( $G _ { 2 }$ ). The effective supersymmetry spectrum is obtained. How to reproduce realistic Yukawa couplings is studied. Fine-tuning for an 126 GeV Higgs is much reduced by the large $A$ term due to direct Higgsmessenger interaction. Finally, $G _ { 2 }$ is found to be a non-trivial realization of the strong unification scenario in which case we can predict $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } )$ without real unification

# I. INTRODUCTION

A Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs particle of 126 GeV has been discovered at the LHC [1]. If we are insisting on naturalness of the SM, this discovery strengthens motivation for the low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) which stabilizes the Higgs mass at the electroweak (EW) scale.However, there is yet no definite sign of sparticles after the integrated luminosity has reached $\mathrm { 2 0 ~ f b ^ { - 1 } }$ at $\sqrt { s } = 8$ TeV. This null result for the SUSY search sets a lower bound for the first two generation squarks - $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } > 1$ TeV, while stops/sbottoms with a mass about 500 GeV are still allowed [2]. Noticing that naturalness sets an upper bound for sparticle masses as 1 TeV.

SUSY, if it is relevant to the EW physics, should be beyond its simplest version. Actually it was noted long time ago that naturalness only requires the third generation sfermions and particles (gauginos and Higgsinos) that interact significantly with the Higgs to have subTeV masses, while the first two generation sparticles can be heavy up to 20 TeV [3-5]. Such sparticle spectra also alleviate the SUSY FCNC problem. This phenomenological scenario is dubbed Effective SUSY by Cohen et al. [5]. Nowadays this Effective SUSY has become one of the main scenarios to reconcile naturalness with the null SUSY search [6].

In this paper, we realize Effective SUSY through modifying models of Refs.[7, 8]. In those models we have introduced two sets of SM-like gauge groups $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ where $G _ { i } =$ （24 $S U ( 3 ) _ { i } \times S U ( 2 ) _ { i } \times U ( 1 ) _ { i }$ . At the TeV scale, $G _ { 1 }$ is strongly and $G _ { 2 }$ is weakly interacting, respectively. They break diagonally to the SM gauge group. SUSY breaking is due to $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ gauge mediation. Furthermore, $G _ { 2 }$ is of strong unification [8], namely its gauge coupling constants have a common Landau pole at the unification scale [9-11]. In that model, all the three generations were put in $G _ { 2 }$ , that did not result in any sparticle splitting. To make sparticle splitting,the first two generations have to be treated differently from the third one. In this work, the frst two generations are put in $G _ { 1 }$ and the third in $G _ { 2 }$

Among other things, we need to solve the following problems. First, to generate Yukawa interactions between the first two generations and the third generation. This is because three generations are in different gauge sectors from the beginning. Then, to reduce fine tuning of the 126 GeV Higgs. In conventional gauge mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) [12], fine-tuning seemed unavoidable for a l26 GeV Higgs. Furthermore, to re-examine strong unification. This is needed due to all the changes in the particle content,and conditions of

strong unification are quite subtle.

We notice that a similar model was proposed by Craig et al. [13,14] in which the first two generations were also put in $G _ { 1 }$ and the third one in $G _ { 2 }$ . However, there are several main differences. First is about $G _ { 1 }$ . In the model of [14], $G _ { 1 }$ gauge interactions are weakly coupled at the TeV scale, whereas our $G _ { 1 }$ is superstrong. Second is for $G _ { 2 }$ .Their $G _ { 2 }$ gauge interactions unify weakly in the sense of ordinary grand unification, our $G _ { 2 }$ isof strong unification [9-11]. Third is about GMSB. They only use a messenger for $G _ { 1 }$ , and we have messengers both for $G _ { 1 }$ and $G _ { 2 }$ . And finally we need to use direct Higgs-messenger interaction to reduce fine-tuning of a 126 GeV Higgs. These differences make this model qualitatively different.

There were a few other ways to realize Effective SUSY [15,16]. Some of them used an extra $U ( 1 )$ gauge group which contributes larger masses to the first two generation sparticles than to the third generation ones. Usually, this $U ( 1 )$ symmetry suppresses Yukawa couplings for the first two generations compared to that for the third generation, giving an explanation for the fermion mass hierarchy. Some other works assume particular boundary conditions at a high scale, then employ the technique of renormalization group [16].

The paper is organized as follows. Our model will be given in the next section,where flavor physics for fermions and the problem of naturalness in light of a 126 GeV Higgs will be discussed. After all particle contents and the mass spectrum have been fixed, the prediction for $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } )$ will be calculated by means of strong unification in Section III. The final section summarizes our results and gives discussions.

# II. THE MODEL

We consider a SUSY model with two sets of the SM-like gauge group $G _ { 1 }$ and $G _ { 2 }$ where ${ \cal G } _ { i } = S U ( 3 ) _ { i } \times S U ( 2 ) _ { i } \times U ( 1 ) _ { i }$ . The first two and the third generation of matter transform under $G _ { 1 }$ and $G _ { 2 }$ ， respectively. The two Higgs doublets $H _ { u }$ and $H _ { d }$ are in $G _ { 2 }$ . The other fields include SUSY breaking messengers and the Higgs fields which break $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ into the SM. For convenience，we will use field representations under $S U ( 5 )$ to illustrate their representations under $S U ( 3 ) \times S U ( 2 ) \times U ( 1 )$

The GMSB mechanism is employed. Two sets of messenger fields $T _ { 1 }$ ( $T _ { 1 }$ ）and $T _ { 2 }$ ( $T _ { 2 }$ ） are introduced. They transform nontrivially under $G _ { 1 }$ and $G _ { 2 }$ , respectively. Without losing generality, we will focus on the quark/squark sector. At the scale of SUSY breaking, squarks have following masses,

$$
m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } ^ { 2 } \sim ( \frac { g _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } { 1 6 \pi ^ { 2 } } \frac { F } { M } ) ^ { 2 } , \quad \mathrm { { a n d } } \quad m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } } ^ { 2 } \simeq ( \frac { g _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } { 1 6 \pi ^ { 2 } } \frac { F } { M } ) ^ { 2 } .
$$

（204号 $M$ stands for the messenger scale and $\sqrt { F }$ is the measure of SUSY breaking. $g _ { 1 }$ and $g _ { 2 }$ （204号 represent coupling constants for $G _ { 1 }$ and $G _ { 2 }$ respectively. Therefore, we can realize Effective SUSY sparticle spectrum by requiring $g _ { 1 }$ to be much larger than $g _ { 2 }$ . Note that Eq.(1） for $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } ^ { 2 }$ is not exact, because $g _ { 1 }$ is too large.

A pair of Higgs fields $\Phi$ and $\bar { \Phi }$ charged under $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ as $\mathbf { 5 \times 5 }$ and $\mathbf { 5 \times 5 }$ is introduced. $\Phi$ （204 and $\Phi$ have a mass $M _ { \Phi }$ , and they obtain vacuum expectation values (VEVs) as $\left. \Phi \right. = \left. \Phi \right. =$ （204号 $V I _ { 2 } \times I _ { 3 }$ ，where $V \sim M _ { \Phi }$ ， $I _ { 2 }$ and $I _ { 3 }$ are the unit matrix in the subspace of $S U ( 2 ) _ { 1 } \times S U ( 2 ) _ { 2 }$ and $S U ( 3 ) _ { 1 } \times S U ( 3 ) _ { 2 }$ , respectively. As a result, $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ break diagonally to the SM gauge group $S U ( 3 ) _ { c } \times S U ( 2 ) _ { L } \times U ( 1 ) _ { Y }$ . Below the scale of $M _ { \Phi }$ , the effective theory of this model looks like Effective SUSY with following relations among gauge coupling constants,

$$
\frac { 1 } { g _ { s } ^ { 2 } } = \frac { 1 } { g _ { s 1 } ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { g _ { s 2 } ^ { 2 } } , ~ \frac { 1 } { g ^ { 2 } } = \frac { 1 } { g _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { g _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } , ~ \frac { 1 } { g ^ { \prime 2 } } = \frac { 1 } { g _ { 1 } ^ { \prime 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { g _ { 2 } ^ { \prime 2 } } .
$$

Because of the relation $g _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \gg g _ { 2 } ^ { 2 }$ ， SM gauge couplings are almost fully determined by that in $G _ { 2 }$ . More details about breaking of $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ can be found in Ref. [8]. While this model in many aspects is similar to that of Ref. [8], new features come in because of separation of three generations.

Before $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ breaking, three generations are put in different gauge sectors, so there is no marginal operators giving Yukawa couplings between the first two generation matter and the third generation ones. However, higher-dimensional operators such as $H _ { d } Q _ { 3 } \Phi _ { d \bar { d } } d _ { 1 ( 2 ) }$ are allowed by $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ symmetry. Here $\Phi _ { d \bar { d } }$ is the component of the Higgs $\Phi$ with quantum numbers $( 3 , 1 , - \frac { 1 } { 3 } ) * ( \bar { 3 } , 1 , \frac { 1 } { 3 } )$ under $S U ( 3 ) _ { 1 } \times S U ( 2 ) _ { 1 } \times U ( 1 ) _ { 1 } \times S U ( 3 ) _ { 2 } \times S U ( 2 ) _ { 2 } \times U ( 1 ) _ { 2 }$ . This kind of operators can be produced by integrating out appropriate heavy fields, just like the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism [17]. As a result， they are suppressed by $M$ (mass Scale for the heavy felds that have been integrated out) $\frac { 1 } { M } H _ { d } Q _ { 3 } \Phi _ { d \bar { d } } \bar { d } _ { 1 ( 2 ) }$ When $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ （204号 is spntaneously broken i.e. $\Phi _ { d \bar { d } }$ gets VEV,there wilei $\frac { V } { M } H _ { d } Q _ { 3 } \bar { d } _ { 1 ( 2 ) }$ that lead to Yukawa interactions between 1st/2nd generation fermions and 3rd generation fermions. Taking M a small quantity $\sim 0 . 1 \mathrm { - } 0 . 0 1$ , the mass hierarchy between the third generation and the first two is obvious.Roughly speaking, this paves the way to obtain the realistic fermion mass pattern， mixing and CP violation. We can say hierarchy among three generation fermions and that among three generation sfermions are closely connected to each other in this model.

This approach has been discussed in Ref. [14]. There, a vector-like 5 representation is introduced as the mediator that is integrated out. Similarly, in $G _ { 2 }$ ，we introduce a full vector-like generation $( L , d )$ and $( Q , { \bar { u } } , { \bar { e } } )$ as representation $\mathbf { 5 }$ and 10,respectively. Masses of these vectorlike fields are taken to be of the same order $M _ { \Psi }$

In MSSM, the SM-like Higgs has the following mass after including one-loop radiative corrections induced by stops,

$$
m _ { h } ^ { 2 } = m _ { Z } ^ { 2 } \cos ^ { 2 } 2 \beta + { \frac { 3 m _ { t } ^ { 4 } } { 4 \pi ^ { 2 } v ^ { 2 } } } [ \log { \frac { m _ { \tilde { t } } ^ { 2 } } { m _ { t } ^ { 2 } } } + { \frac { X _ { t } ^ { 2 } } { m _ { \tilde { t } } ^ { 2 } } } ( 1 - { \frac { X _ { t } ^ { 2 } } { 1 2 m _ { \tilde { t } } ^ { 2 } } } ) ] ,
$$

where $X _ { t } = A _ { t } - \mu \cot \beta$ . To obtain a 126 GeV Higgs, we either need multi-TeV stops which lead to severe fine-tuning, or turn to the large $A _ { t }$ scenario in which case sub-TeV stops are enough. In conventional GMSB,contribution of $A _ { t }$ is negligible and fine-tuning induced by too heavy stops seems to be unavoidable. To preserve naturalness, we will produce a large （204号 $A _ { t }$ term by extending conventional GMSB.

We choose the messenger $T _ { 2 } ( T _ { 2 } )$ to be the representation 10 ( $\mathbf { 1 0 }$ ). It is found that [18], a large $A _ { t }$ term can be produced without a large Higgs mass. This is due to direct interaction between the Higgs and the messenger in the superpotential,

$$
y H _ { u } T _ { 2 } ^ { Q } T _ { 2 } ^ { \bar { u } } ,
$$

where $T _ { 2 } ^ { Q }$ and $T _ { 2 } ^ { u }$ are components of $T _ { 2 }$ that have same gauge quantum numbers as $Q _ { 3 }$ and （204 $u _ { 3 }$ ,respectively. It should be pointed out that this term is the only one of direct interaction between messengers and ordinary matters by employing the messenger parity. One-loop contribution to the soft term $H _ { u } \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } \tilde { \bar { u } } _ { 3 }$ is extracted from wave function renormalization for the superfield $H _ { u }$ [19],

$$
A _ { t } \sim - \frac { y ^ { 2 } y _ { t } } { 1 6 \pi ^ { 2 } } \frac { F } { M } .
$$

In Ref. [2O], the same way was used to produce a large $A _ { t }$ term except that there it was $Q _ { 3 }$ and $u _ { 3 }$ instead of $H _ { u }$ that interact directly with the messenger. More issues about this way of producing large $A _ { t }$ term can be found in [18][21].

# III. STRONG UNIFICATION

We will consider unification of gauge coupling constants. Because the SM gauge couplings are almost fully determined by those of $G _ { 2 }$ ， what we will really care about, above $G _ { 1 } * G _ { 2 }$ （204号 breaking scale, is the $G _ { 2 }$ gauge coupling constants. So far quite a few new fields have been introduced. The particle content and the mass spectrum are summarized in the following with emphasis on that which are charged under $G _ { 2 }$ . There is only one chiral generation in $G _ { 2 }$ . The two Higgs doublets are in $G _ { 2 }$ . The bi-fundamental Higgs $\Phi$ ( $\Phi$ ） is charged under $S U ( 5 ) _ { 1 } \times S U ( 5 ) _ { 2 }$ as $\mathbf { 5 \times 5 }$ $\left( \mathbf { 5 } \times \mathbf { 5 } \right)$ with a mass $M _ { \Phi }$ . The messengers $T _ { 2 }$ ( $T _ { 2 }$ ) is charged under $G _ { 2 }$ as representation 10(10) with a mass $M$ . Besides, there is an extra vector-like generation charged under $G _ { 2 }$ as representation ${ \bf 5 + 1 0 }$ $\mathbf { ( 5 + 1 0 ) }$ with a mass $M _ { \Psi }$ . For simplicity and definiteness,we will identify $M _ { \Phi }$ and $M _ { \Psi }$ with $M$ in the following analysis.

Below $G _ { 1 } * G _ { 2 }$ breaking scale $M$ ， this model is just that of the minimal SUSY SM, so SM gauge couplings running can be calculated in the usual way. At the scale $M$ ，SM gauge couplings are identified with that in $G _ { 2 }$ . Above the scale $M$ , since there are so many complete representations of $S U ( 5 ) _ { 2 }$ ， while the unification energy scale does not change, gauge couplings in $G _ { 2 }$ grow so fast that they may come across their Landau poles as they evolve to the unification scale. The situation, where gauge couplings reach their common Landau pole, is named as strong unification [8-10]. Using strong unification to predict gauge couplings at the EW scale seems unreasonable because of the strong coupling domain where the perturbative method is not reliable. However, as shown in Ref. [10],ratios of gauge couplings in $G _ { 2 }$ will reach their infra-fixed points at the scale $M$ . Thus,we can determine SM gauge couplings at the EW scale, with ratios of gauge couplings in $G _ { 2 }$ at the scale $M$ （204号 as boundary condition where perturbative calculation already works.

Boundary conditions for gauge couplings of $G _ { 2 }$ at the scale $M$ satisfy the following relation [10],

$$
\alpha _ { 2 } ^ { \prime } ( M ) b _ { 2 } ^ { \prime } = \alpha _ { 2 } ( M ) b _ { 2 } = \alpha _ { s 2 } ( M ) b _ { s 2 } ,
$$

where α2(M) = 9 $\alpha _ { 2 } ^ { \prime } ( M ) = \frac { g _ { 2 } ^ { \prime 2 } ( M ) } { 4 \pi }$ and so forth. $b _ { 2 } ^ { \prime } = \frac { 7 3 } { 5 }$ 73 ， $b _ { 2 } = 9$ and $b _ { s 2 } = 5$ are one-loop beta functions 1   
above the scale $M$ for $g _ { 2 } ^ { \prime }$ ， $g _ { 2 }$ and $y _ { s 2 }$ , respectively. In the following, we will first calculate the prediction for $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } )$ in a simply way to illustrate the usage of strong unification, and then take into consideration two-loop contributions and low-scale threshold effects induced by sparticles’ mass splitting among different generations.

In the first case, $\alpha ^ { \prime } ( M )$ and $\alpha ( M )$ can be determined by $\alpha ^ { \prime } ( M _ { Z } )$ and $\alpha ( M _ { Z } )$ through the following equations,

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \alpha ^ { \prime - 1 } ( M ) = \alpha ^ { \prime - 1 } ( M _ { Z } ) - \displaystyle \frac { b ^ { \prime } } { 2 \pi } \ln \displaystyle \frac { M } { M _ { Z } } } } \\ { { \alpha ^ { - 1 } ( M ) = \alpha ^ { - 1 } ( M _ { Z } ) - \displaystyle \frac { b } { 2 \pi } \ln \displaystyle \frac { M } { M _ { Z } } . } } \end{array}
$$

With Eq.(6), we can get $M \sim 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ GeV and $\alpha _ { s } ^ { - 1 } ( M ) = 1 5 . 1 7$ . Finally, $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } )$ is calculated to be 0.119 as follows,

$$
\alpha _ { s } ^ { - 1 } ( M _ { Z } ) = \alpha _ { s } ^ { - 1 } ( M ) + \frac { b _ { s } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { M } { M _ { Z } } .
$$

After inclusion of low scale threshold effects and dominated two-loop contributions, Eqs.(7-9) will be replaced by the following equations,

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \alpha ^ { \prime - 1 } ( M ) = \alpha ^ { \prime - 1 } ( M _ { Z } ) - \frac { \tilde { \tilde { b } } ^ { \prime } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } } } { M _ { Z } } - \frac { \tilde { b ^ { \prime } } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } } { m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } } } - \frac { b ^ { \prime } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { M } { m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } } } \\ { - \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 1 1 } } { b ^ { \prime } } \ln \frac { \alpha ^ { \prime } ( M ) } { \alpha ^ { \prime } ( M _ { Z } ) } - \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 1 2 } } { b } \ln \frac { \alpha ( M ) } { \alpha ( M _ { Z } ) } - \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 1 3 } } { b _ { s } } \ln \frac { \alpha _ { s } ( M ) } { \alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } ) } , } \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \alpha ^ { - 1 } ( M ) = \alpha ^ { - 1 } ( M z ) - \displaystyle \frac { \tilde { \beta } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 3 } } } { M _ { Z } } - \frac { \tilde { \beta } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } } { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 3 } } } - \frac { b } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { M } { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } } } \\ { - \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 2 1 } } { W } \ln \frac { \alpha ^ { \prime } ( M ) } { \alpha ^ { \prime } ( M _ { Z } ) } - \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 2 2 } } { b } \ln \frac { \alpha ( M ) } { \alpha ( M _ { Z } ) } - \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 2 3 } } { b _ { s } } \ln \frac { \alpha _ { s } ( M ) } { \alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } ) } , } \\ { \alpha _ { s } ^ { - 1 } ( M ) = \alpha _ { s } ^ { - 1 } ( M z ) - \displaystyle \frac { \tilde { \beta } _ { s } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 3 } } } { M _ { Z } } - \frac { \tilde { b } _ { s } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } } { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 3 } } } - \frac { b _ { s } } { 2 \pi } \ln \frac { M } { m _ { \bar { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } } } \\ { - \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 3 1 } } { W } \ln \frac { \alpha ^ { \prime } ( M ) } { \alpha ^ { \prime } ( M _ { Z } ) } - \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 3 2 } } { b } \ln \frac { \alpha ( M ) } { \alpha ( M _ { Z } ) } - \frac { 1 } { 4 \pi } \frac { b _ { 3 3 } } { b _ { s } } \ln \frac { \alpha _ { s } ( M ) } { \alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } ) } , } \end{array}
$$

with

$$
\begin{array} { l l l l l } { { \tilde { \tilde { b } } ^ { \prime } = \frac { 4 1 } { 1 0 } } } & { { \tilde { b } ^ { \prime } = \frac { 7 9 } { 1 5 } } } & { { b ^ { \prime } = \frac { 3 3 } { 5 } } } & { { b _ { 1 1 } = \frac { 1 9 9 } { 2 5 } } } & { { b _ { 1 2 } = \frac { 2 7 } { 5 } } } & { { b _ { 1 3 } = \frac { 8 8 } { 5 } } } \\ { { \tilde { \tilde { b } } = - \frac { 1 9 } { 6 } } } & { { \tilde { b } = - \frac { 1 } { 3 } } } & { { b = 1 } } & { { b _ { 2 1 } = \frac { 9 } { 5 } } } & { { b _ { 2 2 } = 2 5 } } & { { b _ { 2 3 } = 2 4 } } \\ { { \tilde { \tilde { b } } _ { s } = - 7 } } & { { \tilde { b _ { s } } = - \frac { 1 3 } { 3 } } } & { { b _ { s } = - 3 } } & { { b _ { 3 1 } = \frac { 1 1 } { 5 } } } & { { b _ { 3 2 } = 9 } } & { { b _ { 3 3 } = 1 4 } } \end{array}
$$

It is found that $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } ) \sim 0 . 1 1 7$ and $M \sim 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ GeV, when and take typical value 1 $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } }$ $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } }$ TeV and 10 TeV respectively. This value is very close to world average value $0 . 1 1 8 4 \pm 0 . 0 0 0 7$ [22].

In the above discussion, we have taken the limit $\frac { g _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } { g _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } }$ goes to infinity so that SM gauge coupling can be identified with that in $G _ { 2 }$ at the Higgsing scale. There will be several percents uncertainty in this identification, if we take into consideration that $\frac { g _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } { g _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } }$ is finite which is several tens. This uncertainty will affect the prediction for $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } )$ substantially. For example, with a typical value 20\~40 for9² $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } )$ will have an uncertainty about 0.005. However, if three gauge couplings in $G _ { 1 }$ sector has the same ratio with the counterparts in （204号 $G _ { 1 }$ sector,

$$
\frac { g _ { 1 } ^ { \prime } } { g _ { 2 } ^ { \prime } } = \frac { g _ { 1 } } { g _ { 2 } } = \frac { g _ { s 1 } } { g _ { s 2 } }
$$

this uncertainty will disappear. This is because the boundary condition Eq.(6) just depends on the ratio of gauge coupling constants.

# IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In summary, we have presented a model of realizing the Effective SUSY. Two sets of the SM-like gauge group $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 } = { \cal S U ( 3 ) } _ { 1 } \times { \cal S U ( 2 ) } _ { 1 } \times { \cal U ( 1 ) } _ { 1 } \times { \cal S U ( 3 ) } _ { 2 } \times { \cal S U ( 2 ) } _ { 2 } \times { \cal U ( 1 ) } _ { 2 }$ have been introduced which break diagonally to the SM gauge group at the energy scale $M \sim 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ （204号 GeV. Gauge couplings in $G _ { 1 }$ have been assumed much larger than that in $G _ { 2 }$ . GMSB has been adopted. The first two generations (third one） are charged only under $G _ { 1 }$ ( $G _ { 2 }$ ). The Effective SUSY spectrum has been obtained naturally. Fine-tuning for an 126 GeV Higgs is much reduced. With all the fields necessary and their masses fixed, $\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } )$ can be predicted in the scenario of strong unification.

Compared to our previous works [7, 8], in addition to the Effective SUSY spectrum, following new features have arisen.

(1） An extra vector-like generation charged under $G _ { 2 }$ has been introduced as mediator, so as to reproduce realistic Yukawa couplings between the first two generations and the third generation,i.e. the suitable fermion mass hierarchy and the CKM mixing matrix. (2) Fine-tuning for an 126 GeV Higgs is much reduced by a large $A _ { t }$ term produced by direct Higgs-messenger interaction， because the messenger for $G _ { 2 }$ has been specified to be a 10 representation under the $S U ( 5 )$ ，which is absent in conventional GMSB.

The following three main aspects clarify differences of Ref. [14] from our model.

(a) In Ref. [14], gauge couplings in $G _ { 1 }$ and $G _ { 2 }$ were comparable. Only a messenger for $G _ { 1 }$ was introduced, and the third generation sparticles could feel SUSY breaking only after the breaking of $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ ，so that $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } }$ was suppressed by an additional factor $\frac { V } { M }$ in comparison

with mQ1,2°

(b) There was no need to produce a large $A _ { t }$ term in Ref. [14]. Due to the comparability of gauge couplings in $G _ { 1 }$ and $G _ { 2 }$ ， and the low scale of $M _ { \Phi } \sim 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ GeV, non-decoupling D term contribution to the Higgs mass could be significant. (c) There, unification of gauge couplings was “weak” in the sense of in comparison with strong unification.

Here comes our final remarks. First, it is worth pointing out that despite the term strong "unification”, $S U ( 3 ) \times S U ( 2 ) \times U ( 1 )$ do not necessarily unify into a larger simple group, so that there can be no proton decay at all, and thus there is no the so-called doublet-triplet splitting problem. Because $g _ { 2 } \ll g _ { 1 }$ ，the $G _ { 2 }$ unification scale is the same as that of the traditional GUT, namely about $3 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 6 }$ GeV. Second, gauge couplings in $G _ { 1 }$ are expected to be a realization of GUT. We have not studied that much because it does not affect our physical results on one hand and the couplings are too strong to use perturbation method on the other hand. Third, LHC has set a lower bound on the gluino mass $m _ { \tilde { g } } > 1$ TeV [2], and this bound would also apply to $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } }$ in traditional GMSB. This is not the case for this model, because $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ breaking also contributes the gluino an additional mass $\sim \frac { g _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } V ^ { 2 } } { M }$ from mixing with the fermionic component of $\Phi$ . This contribution is expected to be larger than the purely soft mass 162M]iedeing reduces $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } }$ . In a word,this model alows an interesting mass pattern $m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 1 , 2 } } \gg m _ { \tilde { g } } \gg m _ { \tilde { Q } _ { 3 } }$ Finally, in this work we have taken that the first two generations in the same gauge group. It is imaginable that we can introduce one more version of the SM group to split these two generations further. Namely we may expect a model of $[ S U ( 3 ) \times S U ( 2 ) \times U ( 1 ) ] ^ { 3 }$ ,which first breaks into $G _ { 1 } \times G _ { 2 }$ at some higher energy scale.
