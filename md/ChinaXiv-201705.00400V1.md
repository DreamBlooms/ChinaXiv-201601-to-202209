Polymer hydrogels with superior strength and toughness are potential candidate materials for the replacement or engineering of load-bearing tissues.This manuscript reports novel tough nanocomposite hydrogels with an unusual energy dissipation mechanism based on both covalent and physical interactions between clay nanorods and polymer chains.Attapulgite (ATP) nanorods grafted with vinyl groupson the surface served as macro-crossinkers to copolymerize with 2-acrylamido-2- methylpropane-sulfonic acid (AMPS) to form an initial nanocomposite network，which subsequently hosted the polymerization of acrylamide (AAm) monomers to generate a novel nanocomposite double network(DN) hydrogel.The morphology，swelling behavior and compressve properties of the ATPgrafted DN hydrogels were investigated as a function of ATP content $( C _ { \mathsf { A T P } } )$ ，in comparison with the ATP-filled DN gels.With a clay content between $0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ and $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,the nanocomposite hydrogels did not fracture up to a compressive strain of $9 8 \%$ ，exhibiting an initial modulus (E) up to $0 . 3 6 ~ { \mathsf { M P a } }$ a compressive strength higher than $6 5 . 7 \ M \mathsf { P a }$ ，and a work to fracture (or fracture energy) higher than $2 . 6 \ M \mathrm { J \ m } ^ { - 3 } .$ ,in comparison to 0.19 MPa, $1 8 . 6 ~ \mathsf { M P a }$ and $1 . 1 \ M \mathsf { J } \mathsf { m } ^ { - 3 }$ for the conventional DN gels. Cyclic loading-unloading tests showed abnormal residual energy disipation even though the rigid PAMPS network had fractured. Such viscous energy disipation decayed during cyclic loading，and could be restored depending on time and temperature.This is related to the reversible desorption-re-adsorption of polymer chains from the clay surface.Posible reinforcing and fracture mechanisms are discussed.

# Introduction

Polymer hydrogels,soft materials consisting of physically or chemically cross-linked polymer networks with high water content,1 have been widely recognized as candidate materials for the replacement and/or repair of tissues or organs based on the concept of tissue engineering.² The mechanical properties ofhydrogels,including strength,toughness,and stiffness,are critical to cell growth and tissue regeneration.Strong and tough hydrogels are of special interest for the repair or regeneration of load-bearing bio-tissues,such as cartilages,tendons,and ligaments, that present excellent mechanical properties including high toughness,shock absorbance,low sliding friction (cartilage),and/or robust contraction (muscle).3,4 Most synthetic and natural hydrogels,however,are weak and fragile.

Enormous efforts have been devoted to developing hydrogels with extraordinary toughness and strength.Double network hydrogels (DN gels)5 and nanocomposite gels $( \operatorname { N C } \operatorname { g e l s } ) ^ { 6 }$ are two types of tough hydrogels.DN gels are comprised of a contrast structure,in which the first network is a tightly crosslinked rigid polyelectrolyte，while the second network is a loosely crosslinked flexible neutral polymer interpenetrating the first network. Upon loading,the rigid PAMPS network fractures into fragments that serve as physical and partly chemical crosslinkers for the soft and ductile PAAm to sustain high stress and strain.'Due to the irreversible fracture of the first network, the hydrogel loses its capability to dissipate energy upon subsequent loading and behaves like a rubber.The subsequent loading-unloading curves overlap，and the residual energy dissipating loops are negligible.9,1o This has been a major limitation of DN gels for applications as tissue substitutes.

Tough and resilient nanocomposite hydrogels (NC gels) are usually synthesized by in situ polymerization of hydrophilic monomers in the presence of exfoliated clay (e.g., laponite11-14) nanosheets as physical crosslinking junctions to strongly adsorb the polymer chains (e.g.，poly( $N \cdot$ isopropylacrylamide)15-17or polydimethylacrylamide18,19) on the clay surface. On average, each clayplatelet mayadsorb several polymer chains,while a single ultra long polymer chain $( { \sim } 1 0 ^ { 6 } ~ \mathrm { g } ~ \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { 2 0 }$ may adhere onto several clay platelets,resulting in the formation of physical networks. At large strains，the highly stretched polymer segments or chains detach from the clay surface,allowing for a large strain of up to $3 5 0 0 \%$ .11 Thus,the energy dissipation is a sum of the entropic elasticity of the chains and the enthalpic contribution from the polymer-clay interactions.Upon unloading, the elastic deformation of the polymerchains recovers,and some of the detached chains/segments re-adsorb onto the clay surface.11,21-25

Most recently,the combination of nanoparticles and the double network concept has been demonstrated to be effective in generating tough hydrogels.26,27 Silica nanoparticles stronglyadsorb polymerchains and significantly improve the strength and toughness of hydrogels.28-3o The adsorbed polymer layer on the surface of the silica particles forms core-shell structures that presumably account for the superior toughness.29 Previously,we have used surface-functionalized silica particles as multi-functional crosslinkers for the synthesis of a PAMPS network of DN gels.³1 As a result, the nanocomposite DN hydrogels sustained a compressive strain of up to $9 8 \%$ and stress above $7 0 ~ \mathrm { { M P a } }$ without fracturing.31 The covalent bonding and physical adsorption of polymer chains onto silica nanoparticles are suggested to account for the high mechanical strength and toughness. Dong et al.32 introduced bare carbon nanotubes into the first network of PAMPS/PAAm DN hydrogels,which improved the strength and toughness.

In this work, novel nanocomposite double network hydrogels were synthesized by using surface-modified attapulgite (ATP) nanorods as macro-crosslinkers to copoly merize with conventional PAMPS/PAAm double network hydrogels (Scheme 1).The ATP nanorods,with a diameter of

$2 0 { - } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and a length of $2 0 0 { - } 1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ,contain exchange able cations in the framework channels and reactive -OH groups on surface,33 which allow for the physical adsorption of polymer chains on the surface³4 and convenient surface chemical modification with functional groups.35 Both surface-grafted and bare ATP nanorods are used to form composites with the DN gels.The morphologies,swelling behavior and compressive properties of these novel nanocomposite DN gels are compared.These nanocomposite hydrogels show extraordinary compressive strength and toughness,depending on the clay content.Moreover,the reversible desorption-re-adsorption of polymer chains，as well as covalent bonding,to the clay surface imparts residual capabilitytodissipate energydespite thepermanentdamage of the rigid PAMPS network.

# Experiments

# Materials

Attapulgite (ATP,Jiuchuan Nano-Material Technology Co.Ltd., Jiangsu,China) was dried in vacuum at $1 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ before use.Ethanol (A.R.),vinyltriethoxysilane (VTEOS,C.P.),acetic acid (AAc,A.R.),acrylamide (AAm,A.R.),and potassium persulfate (KPS,A.R.）were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd.,and used asreceived.2-Acrylamido 2-methylpropane-sulfonic acid (AMPS, $9 8 \%$ ,Aladdin Chemistry Co.Ltd.）and $N , N ^ { \prime }$ -methylene-bisacrylamide(MBAA， $9 9 \%$ Aladdin) were recrystallized from methanol before use.Deionized (DI) water was bubbled with nitrogen gas for more than $^ { 1 \mathrm { h } }$ prior to use.

# ModificationofATPwithVTEOS

ATP(2 g) was sonicatedin EtOH-water $7 5 ~ \mathrm { m L } : 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ Then,asolutionofVTEOs $( 5 ~ \mathrm { m L } )$ inwater $\mathrm { 4 5 ~ m L }$ )wasadded under vigorous stirring,followed byacidification to $\mathrm { p H } 3 . 0$ with AAc.The mixture was then transferred intoaflaskand refluxed at ${ 7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } } \mathbf { C }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .Finally,the suspension was centrifuged and washedwithdeionized water to $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0$ ,followedbywashingwith ethanol 3 times. The product, V-ATP,was lyophilized for use.36

# Preparation of double networkhydrogels

Double network hydrogels were synthesized by a two-step sequential free-radical polymerization method as described previously.31 In the first step, $4 \mathrm { \ m o l { \% } }$ MBAA and $0 . 1 \mathrm { \ m o l \% }$ initiator KPS with respect to AMPS were added to a $^ { 1 \mathbf { M } }$ AMPS solution.After being bubbled with nitrogen gas for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ,the solution was transferred into a mold consisting of two glass plates separated bya $2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ silicone rubber spacer.The mold was placed in a water bath at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $^ { 1 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ for the polymerization and gelation of AMPS.In the second step,the PAMPS gel was swollen in a large amount of aqueous solution containing 3 M AAm, $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { \ m o l \% }$ MBAA and $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { \ m o l \% }$ KPS for1 day until equilibrium was reached.The swollen PAMPS gel was sandwichedby two glass plates and heated at $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $^ { 1 0 \mathrm { h } }$ in a water bath to polymerize the AAm.Finally, the gels were swollen in a large excess of water for1week,with the water being changed every day to remove the residual chemicals.37,38

# Preparation of nanocomposite DN gels

The synthesis procedure of nanocomposite DN gels is the same as described above,except that in the first step an aqueous dispersion of V-ATP (0.1,0.5,1,1.5 and $2 \ \mathrm { w t \% }$ with respect to AMPS) was added into the aqueous AMPS solution with sonication,followed by the routine synthesis procedure of DN gels (Scheme 1).For comparison,bare ATP was also blended with the AMPS solution for the synthesis of DN gels.The resulting gels were named as DNmA-V for the ATP-grafted nanocomposite DN, andDNmA for the ATP-filled DN gels,with DN indicating the double network hydrogels,A indicating attapulgite,V indicating VTEOS, and $m$ indicating the weight ratio $( \mathrm { w t \% } )$ Of ATP to AMPS.

# Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)

ATP/KBr and V-ATP/KBr platelets were scanned using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,United States) in the range of $4 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at a resolution of $4 ~ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ with an average of 32 scans.

# Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

The suspensions of attapulgites or modified ATP were cast on carbon-coated copper grids and dried at room temperature for TEM imaging.The nanocomposite DN gels were embedded in epoxy resin for cryo-microtoming at $- 4 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ with a glass knife to ca. $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ thick sections using a PT-XL ultra-microtome (RMC Corporation). The thin sections were collected onto copper grids for imaging using a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai F20,FEI Inc.,Oregon) with an accelerating voltage of $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k V }$

# Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

For SEMimaging, the hydrogels were freeze-fractured in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried.The fracture surfaces of the dehydrated gels were sputtered with a thin layer of platinum for SEM scanning using a Hitachi S48oo instrument (Hitachi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of $1 5 { \mathrm { ~ k V } }$

# Swelling behavior of hydrogels

To determine the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR) of the gels,a small fully swollen hydrogel sample with an original weight $W _ { 0 }$ wassuccessivelydriedat $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ and at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in avacuum oven for $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to approach a dry weight $W _ { \mathrm { d } }$ The ESR was calculated using the equation $\mathrm { E S R } = ( W _ { 0 } - W _ { \mathrm { d } } ) / W _ { \mathrm { d } } \times 1 0 0 \% \$ Eight samples were tested for each gel to obtain the average ESR.

# Compression and cyclic compression tests

The mechanical properties of the hydrogels were measured with an Instron 5567 (Instron Inc,MA) instrument in compression mode.Five specimens were tested for each hydrogel.Each specimen was coated with a thin layer of silicon oil to prevent water evaporation.

For the compression tests,a cylindrical sample $( 9 ~ \mathrm { \ m m }$ diameter and $\mathsf { 5 } \mathrm { - } 7 \mathrm { m m }$ height) was compressed at a strain rate of $1 0 \% \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ with a $1 0 \mathrm { k N }$ load cell. The maximum compression limit was set at $9 8 \%$ strain to protect the load cell. The nominal stress, $\sigma$ ,was calculated approximately using $\sigma = { F } / { \pi } { R } ^ { 2 }$ ,where $F$ is the load force and $R$ is the original radius of the specimen. The nominal strain (ε) under compression was defined as the change in height $( h )$ relative to the original height $\left( h _ { 0 } \right)$ of the freestanding specimen, $\varepsilon = ( h _ { 0 } ~ - ~ h ) / h _ { 0 } ~ \times ~ 1 0 0 \%$ ，The initial modulus $( E )$ was calculated as the slope of the compressive stress-strain curve within the range $\varepsilon = 5 { - } 1 0 \%$ . The fracture toughness of hydrogels was characterized by the fracture energy density,or work to fracture $( U , \mathbf { M } \mathbf { J } \mathbf { m } ^ { - 3 } )$ ,which was obtained by integrating the area under the stress-strain curve:39

$$
U = \int { \boldsymbol { \sigma } } \mathrm { d } { \boldsymbol { \varepsilon } } 
$$

Cyclic compressive loading-unloading tests were performed immediately after the first loading-unloading cycle on fresh samples.After cyclic tests,the samples were kept in silicone oil at different temperatures for different durations. Then compression tests were conducted on these samples for comparison with the previous cyclic compression data.40

# Results and discussion

# Morphology and structure of double network hydrogels with modified ATPnanorods

The surface modification of attapulgite with VTEOS was verified by the new Si-O-Si bands appearing in the FTIR spectrum at 1120,1080,1031,and $7 9 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ,41-44 as well as those at $3 0 6 2 \thinspace \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ （20 $\scriptstyle ( = \mathbf { C } \mathbf { H } _ { 2 }$ asymmetric stretch), $1 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { c m } } ^ { - 1 }$ 0 $\scriptstyle \mathrm { C = C }$ stretch) and 1274 $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $\scriptstyle ( = \mathbf { C } \mathbf { H }$ in-plane bend) (Fig. 1c).45 The modified nanorods appear hairy under TEM observation (Fig. S1at),in contrast to the smooth surface of bare ATP (Fig. S1bt). The diameter and length of the ATP nanorods were not affected by the surface modification.

The nanocomposite hydrogels show typical porous structures (Fig.2a-f). The ATP nanorods are well dispersed in the polymer matrix (Fig.2g).The content of ATP nanorods has a remarkable influence on the pore size of the hydrogels:as the ATP content $\left( C _ { \mathrm { A T P } } \right)$ increases from 0.1 to1 and $2 \mathrm { w t \% }$ , the pore size decreased rapidly (Fig.2h). For each $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ ,theDNmA gels (Fig.2d-f) showed larger average pore size than those of the DNmA-V gels (Fig. 2a-c)，although the differences are not statistically significant (Fig.2h).The dense porous structures with high ATP content may indicate a densely crosslinked structure.In addition to the physical adsorption of polymer chains onto the ATP nanorods,the covalent bonding of polymer chains on the vinyl-functionalized surface may result ina higher crosslink density in the DNmA-V gels than in the DNmA gels.

The hydrogels show lower equilibrium swelling ratios (ESR) with increasing ATP content (Fig.3).In the DN hydrogels,the swelling is predominantly determined by the balance of the elasticity of the first network and the osmotic pressure of the second neutral network,owing to their contrasting structures.46 Here,the decrease in swelling ratio is mainly attributed to the higher elasticity of the dense porous network with increasing $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ (Fig.2) through covalent bonding or physical adsorption of polymer chains onto the ATP surface.At each $C _ { \mathbf { A T P } }$ ，the ESR value is lower for the DNmA-V gels than for the DNmA gels. These observations further indicate the densernetwork of the nanocomposite DN gels than the clay-free DN gel.

# Mechanical properties of the DNmA-V and DNmA hydrogels

The compressive properties,including elastic modulus $( E )$ stress at $9 0 \%$ strain $\left( \sigma _ { \mathrm { c } , 0 . 9 } \right)$ ,fracture stress $\left( \sigma _ { \mathrm { c , f } } \right)$ ,fracture strain $\left( \varepsilon _ { \mathrm { c , f } } \right)$ ，and fracture toughness $( U )$ ，of the nanocomposite DN hydrogels are summarized in Table1.The hydrogels did not fracture up to $9 8 \%$ strain with $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } } \leq 1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ .For DNmA-V, fracture strength and fracture toughness were improved to above $6 5 . 7 \mathrm { \ } \mathrm { M P a }$ and $2 . 6  { \mathrm { ~ M J ~ m ~ } } ^ { - 3 }$ at a $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ of $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,in comparison to $1 8 . 6 ~ \mathrm { M P a }$ and $1 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M J ~ m ~ } ^ { - 3 }$ for the conventional DN gel. Further increases in $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ led to decreases in the fracture stress and strain and the fracture toughness,which might be attributed to the increased rigidity of the network having more crosslinks and entanglements with the higher clay content.However, these values are still higher than those of the nanorod-free double network hydrogels.At each $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ value, DNmA-V showed a higher modulus,compressive stress,and fracture toughness than for the corresponding DNmA.At $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } } >$ $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,the fracture properties of DNmA-V decreased slightly, while those for the DNmA decayed more rapidly with the increasing ATP nanorod content. Strong physical adsorption and/or covalent bonding between polymer chains and nanorods have been recognized to improve the strength and stiffness of nanocomposite hydrogels.16 The strong physical adsorption ofPAAmchains with the ATP nanorods was verified by the in situ polymerization of AAm monomers in the presence of bare ATP nanorods in an aqueous solution,which resulted in ahydrogel without using any crosslinking agents.In contrast, the AMPS solution did not gel during in situ polymerization with ATP (Fig. $^ { S 2 \dagger } .$ ). These results indicate the strong physical adsorption between the PAAm chains and the clay nanorods. Similar strong physical adsorption of polymer chains to clay surfaces has been thought to account for the super toughness of polymer-clay nanocomposite hydrogels due to energy dissipation through the desorption of polymer chains from the clay surface.13

# Hysteresis:energydissipationof thenanocompositedouble network hydrogels

In the nanocomposite double network hydrogels,the strong polymer-clay adsorption enables residual energy dissipation after the rupture of the PAMPS network.This property was demonstrated by performing second loading-unloading tests at $\varepsilon = 0 . 9 0$ following the first test to the same strain on fresh hydrogels. The second loading-unloading curves showed obvious hysteresis loops for the DNmA-V (Fig. 4b) and DNmA (Fig.4c) hydrogels,in comparison to the overlapped loadingunloading curves of the clay-free DN gel after the rupture of the rigid AMPS network (Fig. 4a).8

The energy dissipation by the hydrogels, $\Delta U _ { \mathrm { : } }$ ,is defined as the area of the hysteresis loop encompassed by the loadingunloading curve:47

$$
\Delta U = \int _ { \mathrm { l o a d i n g } } \sigma _ { \mathrm { c o m p } } \mathrm { d } \varepsilon - \int _ { \mathrm { u n l o a d i n g } } \sigma _ { \mathrm { c o m p } } \mathrm { d } \varepsilon
$$

The energy dissipation of the first loading-unloading cycle $( \Delta U ^ { \mathrm { { 1 s t } } } )$ increased linearly with the $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ value (Fig. 4d). This result is in accordance with the SEM images in Fig.2,and the sweling behavior in Fig.3.The dense porous structures may stem from the strong adsorption of polymer chains onto the surface of ATP. The $\Delta U ^ { \mathbf { 1 } \mathbf { s } \mathbf { t } }$ values of the DNmA-V gels were higher than those of the DNmA gels,with the difference increasing with $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ (Fig. 4d).

The $\Delta U ^ { 2 \mathrm { n d } }$ values of the second loading-unloading tests reflect the energy dissipation other than that caused by the rupture of the rigid PAMPS network. The $\Delta U ^ { 2 \mathrm { n d } }$ values for the DNmA and DNmA-V increased with $C _ { \mathrm { A T P } }$ (Fig. 4e),with the values of the latter being higher than those of the former.Under high strain,desorption of polymer chains from the clay surface dissipates energy.Moreover，for the DNmA-V,the combined contributions from both the physical adsorption and covalent bonding may account for the higher energy dissipation during the second loading-unloading tests.

The contribution from the polymer-clay interaction to the overall energy dissipation can be evaluated by dividing $\Delta U ^ { 2 \mathrm { n d } }$ by $\Delta U ^ { \mathrm { 1 s t } }$ (Fig. 4f). With the increasing clay content, the ratio $\Delta U ^ { 2 \mathrm { n d } } /$ $\Delta U ^ { \mathrm { 1 s t } }$ increases,indicating an increasing contribution from the polymer-clay interaction to the energy dissipation mechanism of the nanocomposite hydrogels.The ratio forDNmA-Vis higher than that for DNmA,indicating the increased contribution of polymer chain detachment from the nanorods in the DNmA-V.A possible interpretation of this is as follows:when ATP is covalently fixed in the first network,the PAAm chains penetrate through the covalent networks reversibly adsorbed onto the clay surfaces,and may adopt conformations such as trains,loops and entanglements with covalent bonds on the ATP surface.The PAAmchains are restricted byneighboring covalent bonds and are difficult to peel off from clay surface compared to in the ATPfilledhydrogels.

The energy dissipation from desorption $( \Delta U ^ { 2 \mathrm { n d } } )$ is only $12 \%$ (DN2A-V) of that of the rupture energy of the DN gel, due to the permanent damage of the sacrificial PAMPS network.However, it is interesting that such a small energy dissipation was recoverable,primarily due to the reversible desorption-re adsorption of polymer chains onto the clay surface.This will be discussed below.

‘ For gels that do not fracture at $9 8 \%$ strain,the listed stress values are calculated at $9 8 \%$ strain. These hydrogels do not fracture at strain of $9 8 \%$

# Energydissipationuponcyclicloading-unloadingtests

The contribution from the covalent bonding and physical adsorption to the energy dissipation was further investigated by cyclic compressive loading-unloading tests of the DNmA and DNmA-V gels.The cyclicloading-unloading testswith $9 0 \%$ strain led to a slight drop of the loading curve,while the $\sigma _ { \mathrm { c } , 0 . 9 0 }$ value remains constant (Fig.5a).Asa result, the area of the hysteresis loop decayed in the second,third,fourth,and fifth cycles,eventually reaching a plateau value (Fig. 5b). These values are higher than those of the conventional DN gels.Again, the $\Delta U$ values of DNmA-V were higher than those of the DNmA,but the difference between them diminished with further testing (Fig. 5b).The decay of energy dissipation capability of these nanocomposite hydrogels indicatesaviscous dissipation mechanism primarily based on the gradual desorption of the polymer chains from the claynanorods.In contrast,the DN hydrogels maintainedalow dissipation of around $1 0 \mathrm { ~ k J ~ m } ^ { - 3 }$ during the cyclic tests,which may originate from the very small amount of chemical bonding between the PAMPS and PAAm chains.38

# Reversible desorption-re-adsorption of polymer chains onto theclaysurface

The decayed viscous dissipation could be restored by the re adsorption of the polymer chains onto the clay surface.This was realized by restoring the tested samples at different temperatures forcertain time intervalsafter the cyclic testsat $\varepsilon = 0 . 9 0$ The extent and rate of recovery depended on temperature and time.For example,after storing the 5-cycle-tested hydrogels $\left( \varepsilon = 0 . 9 0 \right)$ at 25 or $5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ,arecovery of the energy dissipation towards the $\Delta U ^ { 2 \mathrm { n d } }$ values (those obtained right after the rupture of the PAMPS network,solid lines in Fig.6) was achieved when the samples were subjected to compressive loading-unloading tests (i.e.,the sixth test).

The extent of recovery is evaluated by a ratio of the sixth energy dissipation to that of the second test, i.e., $\Delta U ^ { \mathrm { G t h } } / \Delta U ^ { 2 \mathrm { n d } } \times$ $1 0 0 \%$ . The DNmA-V gels always showed a lower recovery ratio than the DNmA gels (Fig. 6d). During the cyclic tests, the covalentbonding between the polymerchains and theclay nanorods may be permanently damaged,which gradually diminishes the difference between the DNmA-V and DNmA gels (Fig. 5b).The damage to the covalent bonds is not reversible,leaving a gap between these two kinds of nanocomposite hydrogels on the recovery curve (Fig. 6d).

Recently,Marcellan et al.48 revealed that transient physical interactions between silica nanoparticles and polymer chains allowed for reversible adsorption-desorption.Thus,the“sacrificial"silica/polymer interactions ruptured to release stress and avoided permanent damage to the covalent bonds.Reversible dissipation and recovery were demonstrated on the time scale of $_ { 1 - 1 0 \mathrm { ~ s ~ } }$ ：

In our case, the physical adsorption of PAAm chains onto the clay nanorod surface may be reversible,allowing for desorption under high strain to dissipate energy. Beyond the physical adsorption，the covalent bonding between PAMPS and clay nanorods in DNmA-Vleads to additional stress transfer between the ruptured PAMPS fragments and the PAAm matrix,which may explain the higher energy dissipation than for the DNmA.

The recovery rate in these nanocomposite hydrogels may be slower than the time scale of Marcellan's silica/polymer hydrogel at room temperature,probably due to the complex semi-interpenetrating structures of the DN matrix where the ruptured PAMPS fragments are highly entangled with the PAAm.As a result, the $\Delta U$ value decays after multiple loadingunloading cycles.Recovery towards the second loading level can be accelerated at elevated temperatures to favor the re-adsorption of PAAm chains onto the clay nanorods.Such recovery behavior has not been addressed in previous work on nano composite double network hydrogels reinforced by silica nanoparticles³1 or carbon nanotubes.² Thisis the first demonstration of the combined effects of physical adsorption and covalent bonding of polymer chains onto ATP nanorods on the enhanced energy dissipation of the nanocomposite DN gels. The additional viscous dissipation originated from desorptionre-adsorption between molecular chains and ATP nanorods,49 and,although relatively small, it may illuminate new studies to develop novel tough and recoverable hydrogels.

# Possible fracture mechanism

It is well-known that the rupture of materials is a process of crack growth and propagation leading to the loss of stability.49,50 First, a defect is produced in the stress concentration area, it propagates gradually to form a macroscopic flaw,and then the crack tip passes through the inner part under further loading.The rigid PAMPS network fractured intoclusters,which behave as flexible physical (and slightly chemical) crosslinkers'8 of the PAAm chains.

In the nanocomposite DN hydrogels,the nanorods,either bare or modified,act as multifunctional macro-crosslinkers for the polymer chains on each nanorod.It is likely that the crosslink density near the nanoparticle surface is greater than in the rest of the composite.51,52 Additionally, some of the PAAm chains adsorbed on the ATP nanorods may act as“anchors".53 In the case of PAAm on laponite platelets,the adsorbed polymer layers have a thickness of ca.1o A.24.54 Such polymer chains stored in a compact state contribute to the residual energy dissipation capability. In the DNmA-V, both covalent bonding and physical adsorption of PAAm onto the ATP nanorods may dissipate more energy as the crack tip propagates and grows.

Similar to the conventional DN hydrogels, the fracture of the rigid PAMPS network is irreversible.The hysteresis of the

nanocomposite DN gels comes from from the physical adsorp tion of PAAm chains onto the clay surface (Scheme 2). During the first loading,most energy is consumed in the rupture of the PAMPS network (Scheme 2b and e),and a fraction of the energy isconsumed by PAAm chain desorption from the ATP nanorod surface.These detached PAAm chains could gradually re-adsorb onto the surface of the ATP nanorods (Scheme 2c and f),which will dissipate energy upon subsequent loading. That is,the energy dissipation capability is recovered.The adsorption of polymer chains onto the clay nanorod surface can be accelerated by increasing the temperature,which has been demonstrated in this study. This finding indicates the possibility of fabricating tough hydrogels that can endure cyclic loading-unloading without completely losing their toughness by introducing strong noncovalent interactions into the DN gels.

# Conclusions

ATP nanorods,at low content,have been used to reinforce PAMPS/PAAm double network hydrogels.In the presence of bare ATP nanorods,the modulus,strength,and toughness of DN gels are significantly improved in comparison to those of the conventional DN gels.Moreover,ATP grafted with vinyl groups on the surface,when copolymerized with the DN gels,further improved the strength and toughness of gels. Such nanocomposite DN gels can withstand a compressive strain of up to $9 8 \%$ ,stress close to $7 0 \mathrm { \mathbf { M P a } }$ without fracturing,and have a work to fracture higher than 2.6 MJ $\mathbf { m } ^ { - 3 }$ . Cyclic loading-unloading tests demonstrate hysteresisloopsafter the fracture of therigid PAMPS network.The physical adsorption of PAAm chains onto the ATP surfaces may serve as reversible sacrificial bonds and lead to increased energy dissipation efficiency when a load is applied. The damage upon loading partially recovers upon unloading.Such super tough and partially recoverable hydro gels may find applications in biomedical fields,such as in substitutes for load-bearing cartilage,although their biocompatibility remains unknown at this moment.
