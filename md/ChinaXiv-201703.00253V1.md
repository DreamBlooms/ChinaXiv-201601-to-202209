# I.INTRODUCTION

REFLECTARRAY is an antenna which is made up of a antenna.As a high gain antenna,reflectarray antennas have many advantages compared to parabolic reflector.such as low cost,low profile and mass，flatness and beam scanning capability [1]. The differential spatial phase delay and the narrow bandwidth of elements are the two factors which limit the bandwidth of a reflectarray [2].

The reflection phase curve of an element is of great importance in design of a reflectarray antenna. In general, element withlarge range linear reflection phase is necessary for a broadband reflectarray. One of the methods to expand the reflection phase range with lower slope is using multilayer configuration [3]-[5]. About two times $3 6 0 ^ { \circ }$ reflection phase range wasprovided by the three-layer element structure in [3] and a $10 \%$ bandwidth was achieved by the three-layer reflectarray. The most conspicuous disadvantage of the multilayer structure is the extra manufacture complexity and increased cost.Multi-resonant element can provide more than $3 6 0 ^ { \circ }$ reflection phase range with less steep for the phase curve [6,7].Multi cross loop elements were used to achieve linear reflection phase curve and $30 \%$ gain bandwidth for an optimized large size reflectarray was measured in [6].

addition tomultilayerconfiguration and multi-resonant structure,using aperture couple patches [8,9] and element with phase delay lines [1O,11] also can achieve large range linear reflection phase.In [11],a broadband element composed of quasi-spiral phase delay lines was proposed to provide about $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ reflection phase range first. Then, a reflectarray using the element was developed and $1 6 . 5 \%$ 1-dB gain bandwidth was obtained.In some designs [11,12],an air layer is added between the substrate and the ground plane in order to obtain a smoother phase curve.However,it will increase the processing error and complexity.Elements with subwavelength lattice period were proposed in [13],and more than $20 \%$ 1-dB gain bandwidth was achieved by a single layer reflectarray.

Archimedes spirals have been widely used in the design of different types of antennas [14,15] except in broadband linearly polarized reflectarray antenna.Using the Archimedes spirals on a broadband linearly polarized reflectarray antenna has not been presented in the previous literature.

In this letter,four-arm Archimedes spiral element is optimized to be used as reflectarray cell for wideband linearly polarized operation. About $5 4 0 ^ { \circ }$ linear reflection phase range has been obtained by varying the length of the spiral arms. Based on the four-arm Archimedesspiral element,a single-layer linearlypolarized reflectarray is fabricated and tested. The reflectarray is designed to operate in Ku-band and about $2 8 . 7 \%$ 1-dBgain bandwidth is achieved, which demonstrates excellent broadband performance.Measured results showed the gain level of 28.35 dB and aperture efficiency of $6 0 . 2 \%$ atcenter frequency of $1 3 . 5 8 \ : \mathrm { G H z }$ ：

# II.ELEMENTCHARACTERISTICS

The geometry of the four-arm Archimedes spiral element is shown in Fig.1.The element is etched on a polyethylene substrate whose relative permittivity is 2.25 and thickness $h$ equals $3 \ \mathrm { m m }$ 、The lattice period of the element $L$ is $1 0 \mathrm { m m }$ which equals O.45 wavelengths at the center frequency of 13.58 $\mathrm { G H z }$ ：

The Archimedes spiral is duplicated around $z$ axis to form the four-arm spiral. In polar coordinates $( r , \theta )$ ，the Archimedesspiral can be described by the equation $r = r _ { 0 } + a \theta$ . The parameter $r _ { 0 }$ is the starting radius and $a$ （202 controls the distance between successive turns.The length of arms vary with the value of angle $\theta$ . By controlling the width of the strips or the distance between successive turns of the Archimedes spiral element, the phase slopes with frequency can be controlled to some extent. The parameters $r _ { 0 } , a$ and width of the spiral $w _ { s }$ are optimized to obtain large range linear reflection phase curve as the length of the arms varied. The final optimized parameters are selected as follows: $r _ { 0 } { = } 0 . 2 \mathrm { m m }$ ， $a = 0 . 6$ ， ${  { w _ { s } } } = 0 . 7 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ ，

To calculate the reflection phase of the four-arm spiral element,the element structure was analyzed in HFSS and master-slave boundaries with Floquet port are used to model periodic structures.In this paper, the element is excited with a linearly polarized incident plane wave and the reflection phase of the element is obtained by varying the length of the arms. Fig.2 shows the effect of different incident angles on the reflection phase and magnitude of the element. It can be concluded that the incident angle has little influence on the reflection phase and magnitude curve of the four-arm spiral element.Thus,it is reasonable to use normal incident plane wave for analyzing the elements.The reflection phase and magnitudecurvesoverawidefrequencyrangeof 11.58-15.58GHz are shown in Fig.3.It is observed that the reflection phase curves at different frequencies have good linearity and in parallel with each other,which indicate the wideband property of the four-spiral element. The reflection magnitude at different frequencies is larger than -O.O6 dB.

# III.DESIGNREFLECTARRAY AND PERFORMANCE

A 441-element offset-fed linearly polarized reflectarray using the four-arm spiral elements is designed and fabricated. Fig.4 presents the photograph of the reflectarray antenna prototype.The distance between each adjacent elements is 10 mm which equals $0 . 4 5 \lambda _ { 0 }$ at $1 3 . 5 8 \ : \mathrm { G H z }$ （ $\lambda _ { 0 }$ is the wavelength in free space ).The focal distance $\mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ and aperture D of the proposed reflectarray both are $2 1 0 \mathrm { m m }$ ，which indicates the F/D ratio of1.The offset angle of the feed antenna is designed as $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ withreferenceto the broadside direction and the main beam points to the mirror direction of the feed offset angle.A pyramidal horn antenna is used as the feed of the reflectarray. The simulated gain of feed horn antenna is $1 5 . 2 ~ \mathrm { d B }$ ，and the 3-dB beamwidth are $3 4 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ and $3 1 . 2 ^ { \circ }$ in the E-plane and H-plane, respectively.For further decreasing of the cross-polarization, the elements are arranged in a mirror symmetric configuration by changing the handedness of the spiral arms between the left and right halves of the reflectarray,as shown in Fig. 4(a).

Theantennasimulatedradiationcharacteristicsare accomplished using the integral equation method ofHFSS.The NSI planar near-field system is used to measure the performances of the fabricated prototype.The measured and simulated radiation patterns of the proposed reflectarray antenna for the co-polar and cross-polar at the center frequency of $1 3 . 5 8 \mathrm { G H z }$ are shown in Fig.5(E-plane) and Fig.6 (H-plane) It can be observed that well agreement has been obtained between measured and simulated results.The measured gain level of28.35 dB is obtained at $1 3 . 5 8 \mathrm { G H z }$ with side lobe levels of $- 2 0 \mathrm { d B }$ and $- 2 2 \mathrm { d B }$ in E-plane and H-plane,respectively. The cross polarization levels are about -29 dB inE-plane and $- 3 3 \mathrm { d B }$ in H-plane.Fig.7 shows the measured and simulated results for the co-polar and cross-polar in $\varphi = 3 0 \mathrm { d e g }$ and $\varphi = { \mathrm { 4 5 d e g } }$ planes.It can be concluded that the cross polarization levels are below $- 2 7 . 5 \ \mathrm { d B }$ in both $\varphi = 3 0 \mathrm { d e g }$ and $\varphi = 4 5$ deg planes, which indicate that the antenna has a low cross polarization even in diagonal planes.

Fig.8 and Fig.9 show the measured radiation patterns of the four-arm element reflectarrayatseveral frequencies(12.41GHz. 13.19GHz,14.36GHz,15.14GHz and 16.31GHz）in E-plane and H-plane,respectively.It can be concluded from Fig.8 and Fig. 9 that the gain ripple is no more than 1 dB in the frequency range of 12.41-16.31GHz. Measured peak gains and efficiency of the reflectarray versus frequencies from $1 2 . 0 2 \ : \mathrm { G H z }$ to 17.09 GHz are shown in Fig. 1O.The aperture efficiency $\varepsilon$ is calculated using $\varepsilon = G _ { { \scriptscriptstyle m } } / D _ { i d e a l } , D _ { i d e a l } = 4 \pi A / \lambda _ { 0 } ^ { 2 }$ ， where （204号 $G _ { { \scriptscriptstyle m } }$ is the measured gain, $D _ { i d e a l }$ is the ideal directivity, $A$ is the aperture area of the reflectarray, and $\lambda _ { 0 }$ is the free space wavelength.It can be observed fromFig.1O that the 1-dB gain bandwidth and aperture efficiency reach $2 8 . 7 \%$ (12.41-16.31 GHz）and $6 0 . 2 \%$ at $1 3 . 5 8 \mathrm { G H z }$ ,respectively.

# IV.CONCLUSION

Four-arm Archimedes spiral elements are applied to design a broadband linearlypolarized reflectarrayantenna. The single-layer four-arm spiral element is optimized to produce large range linear reflection phase curve by varying the length of the arms.The parallel reflection phase curves for different frequencies imply that the four-arm spirals have wideband property as reflectarray elements.Measured results of the proposed reflectarrayantennashow $2 8 . 7 \%$ 1-dBgain bandwidth and $6 0 . 2 \%$ aperture efficiency at $1 3 . 5 8 \mathrm { G H z }$ ：

Table I lists the performance of the proposed four-arm spiral element reflectarray and some previous published works. It can be concluded that the four-arm spiral element reflectarray has the advantages of larger bandwidth compared to the single [11] and multi-layer[4,5] reflectarrays.
