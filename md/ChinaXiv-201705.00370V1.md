In this work,a series of bio-based shape memory polyurethanes were synthesized from polylactide copolymer diols,isophorone disocyanate (IPDl)and chain extenders,in which the chain extenders are used to adjust their transition temperatures and shape memory properties.These bio-based polyurethanes (bio-PUs) show a ${ { T } _ { \mathfrak { g } } }$ in the range of $2 8 . 7 - 3 4 ^ { \circ } C ,$ which is very closed to the body temperature and can be adjusted by the carbon chain length of the chain extenders. Moreover, they have low Young's modulus $( 3 4 . 7 \mathsf { M P a } )$ and high elongation $( 4 3 4 . 0 \% )$ .Through a series of shape memory tests,the bio-PUs exhibit good shape memory behavior at the body temperature with a shape recovery rate greater than $90 \%$ .Especially，the bio-PU from $^ { 1 , 4 }$ -cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) with a nonplanar ring structure displays the highest shape recovery rate, which may be because CHDM in the hard segments acts as a "molecular spring".Therefore,these shape memory bio-PUsare expected to have many practical applications in medical devices.

# 1.Introduction

Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are considered as smart materials that are able to change their shapes for responding to external stimuli, such as temperature,light,electricity,pH and so on.1-4 SMPs have been widely applied in biomedical devices, including cardiovascular stents, sutures,drug-eluting stents, clot removal devices,8,9 tissue engineering,1° etc.,where SMPs areoften required forbiocompatibility,biodegradability,and a shape recovery temperature close to the human body temperature.11 Among them， shape memory polyurethanes (SMPUs) are known to be promisingly responsive materials when used as biomedical devices in the body because of their adjustable transition temperatures for shape recovery and good biocompatibility.12-17 Hasan et al. developed SMPU foam embolic devices with slower actuation times by incorporating isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) into the foam matrix.18 IPDI in the foamplayedakey role in elongating the working time and delaying water plasticization of the material. Singhal et al. synthesized a series of novel biodegradable SMPU foams for embolic biomedical applications by use of the degradable polycaprolactone triol (PCL-t).19 The degradation rate of the materials could be controlled by changing the PCL-t content and the material hydrophobicity.

On the other hand,SMPUs from biomass sources have drawn a great deal of attention due to environmental concerns and the rapid consumption of petroleum.20-22 The most popular bio-based SMPUs (bio-SMPUs) are currently derived from vegetable oils.23-25 However, one obvious shortcoming of vegetable oils-based SMPUs is their poor mechanical properties (e.g. low elongation at break) compared to those petroleum-based SMPUs.26,27 This is because the long dangling chains in the vegetable oil polyols have an adverse effect on the micro-phase separation of the polyurethanes (PUs). Zhu et al.reported that bio-SMPUs with short side chains were prepared from bio-based polyester diols.17 The short branch chains barely have effect on the phase separation，and consequently their mechanical propertiesare satisfactory.Zhu et al.also developeda bio-SMPU by substituting a petroleum based chain extender with a rosin based one.21 With the careful molecular design，they constructed highly incompatible hard and soft segments along the polymer chains,and the obtained SMPUs with supreme shape recovery property.However, the shape recovery temperature of rosin-based SMPUs is much below the body temperature,which are not particularly suitable for biomedical uses.Recently, a serials of SMPs based on bio-based polylactide (PLA) have been reported due to their good biocompatibility and biodegradability.28-33 For example，Jing et al.reported PLA-based SMPs with glass transition temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \right)$ in the range of 33-63 $^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ wereprepared from PLA diols， diisocyanate compounds and 1,4-butanediol (BDO).32,33 The $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ could be adjusted by the molecularweight of PLA diols.However,the PLA-based SMPUs exhibit relatively low elongation at break and high Young's modulus.

In this work,a series of bio-based polyurethanes (bio-PUs) with shape memory behaviors at body temperature were prepared,in which the chain extenders are used to adjust their transition temperatures and shape memory properties.The obtained bio-PUs have high elongation $\left( 4 3 4 . 0 \% \right)$ and low Young's modulus $\left( 3 4 . 7 \mathrm { M P a } \right)$ . Through a serial of shape memory tests,the bio-SMPUs exhibit good shape memory behaviors at body temperature with a shape recovery rate greater than $9 0 \%$ ： These bio-SMPUs are expected to have many practical applications in medical devices.

The series of poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) diols (co-PLAols) were synthesized by ring opening polymerization of LA and CL using $\mathrm { s n o c t } _ { 2 }$ asa catalyst and BDO as a chain transferring agent. In a ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ atmosphere,LA,CL,BDO and $\mathbf { S n O c t } _ { 2 }$ wereadded to $2 \mathrm { L }$ flask free of oxygen and water,where the feed molar ratio of LA and CL was 3.17 and the amount of $\mathrm { s n o c t } _ { 2 }$ was $0 . 1 \%$ with respect to monomers (LA and CL),wt/wt. The reaction was carried out at $1 6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ . The molecular weight of co-PLAol was adjusted to be 1000,2000 and $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { g } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ by changing the feed molar ratio of BDO and monomers $\left( 1 / 6 . 6 , 1 / 1 3 . 3 , 1 / 2 1 . 3 \right)$ ,which were denoted as co-PLAol-1000,co-PLAol-2000 and co-PLAol-3000,respectively.

The bio-PUs were prepared by a two-step polymerization process,as shown in Scheme 1. The molar ratio of co-PLAol3000,IPDI and the chain extenderwas $1 : 2 : 1$ .Theobtained bio-based polyurethane was nominated as bio-PU-xxx,in which xxxindicates thechain extender.The detail information of the obtained bio-PUs is summarized in Table1.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DsC) analysis was performed on a DSC 214 Polyma instrument undera ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ atmosphere.The sampleswere initiallyheated from $- 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ to 180 $^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ,then cooled to $- 3 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ,and followedby heating to $1 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at a rate of $1 0 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ .The glass transition temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \right)$ was determined from the second heating curve to eliminate the thermal history.Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond thermal analyzer at a heating rate of $2 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ from $4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ to $5 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under a ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ atmosphere.Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted on a scanning probe microscope (dimension 3100 V).The AFM sample was prepared by casting the bio-PU solution $\left( 5 \mathrm { \ w t \% } \right)$ on a silicon wafer.The samples were measured at least twice by DSC,TGA,and AFM.

Tensile tests were performed on an Instron 5567 instrument with a speed of $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m \ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ according to ASTM standard (ASTMD638).The data reported were the mean value of five determinations.Cyclic tensile tests were also performed on the same machine according the ref.17.First, the dumbbellshaped sample of $2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ width, $3 5 \ \mathrm { ~ m m }$ length，and $1 \ \mathrm { m m }$ thickness was stretched to $\varepsilon _ { \mathrm { { m } } }$ $2 0 0 \%$ elongation at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ with a speed of $1 0 0 \mathrm { m m } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ . Then,the clamps began to return at a speed of $2 0 \ \mathrm { m m } \ \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ until the force on the sample was 0. After the above two steps,one cycle is complete.Every sample was subjected to 5 cycles and the shape recovery rate $\left( R _ { \mathrm { r } } \right)$ was calculated by the following formula.

The program of the shape memory test of bio-PUs was conducted as follows:firstly,the specimens were bent to a given angle at $3 7 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，Subsequently,they were quenched below $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ using liquid nitrogen.Then the samples were allowed for free recoveryat $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$

# 3.Results and discussion

# 3.1Synthesisandcharacterization ofbio-PUs

In order to get the bio-SMPUs with large elongation at break and low Young's modulus,co-PLAols were used as the soft segment to substitute forPLAdiols.As shown in Scheme1,the bio-PUs were prepared via a two-step polymerization process,which were characterized by FTIR and ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR spectra.Fig.1 shows the FTIR spectra of the obtained bio-PUs.These FTIR spectra are very similar,and they exhibit NH absorption peaks at ca. $3 3 6 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and amide II absorption bands at ca. $1 5 3 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ characteristic of urethane groups,while the $\scriptstyle \mathbf { N } = \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ stretching vibration bands at $2 2 7 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and OH stretching peaks at ca. $3 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ are characteristic of co-PLAol disappear.This result indicates that all IPDI has reacted with co-PLAol and the chain extender.Moreover, the absorption peaks at ca.1750 and 1200 $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ are attributed to the stretching vibrations of $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ and $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C - O - C }$ in the ester units of co-PLAol, respectively.

The $\mathrm { ^ 1 H }$ NMR spectra of the obtained bio-PUs are as shown as Fig. 2.In all spectra, the signals at $5 . 1 7 \mathrm { p p m }$ are assigned to the -CH- connected to $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ in co-PLAol,and the signals at 2.32, 1.64,1.29,1.62,4.08 ppm are ascribed to protons on $- \mathbf { C } \mathbf { = } \mathbf { O } -$ $\mathrm { \bf C \underline { { H } } _ { 2 } - C \underline { { H } } _ { 2 } - C \underline { { H } } _ { 2 } - C \underline { { H } } _ { 2 } - C \underline { { H } } _ { 2 } - C \underline { { H } } _ { 2 } - O - }$ in co-PLAol,respectively. Additionally，peaks at $2 . 8 8 ~ \mathrm { p p m }$ are attributed to $- \mathbf { C H } _ { 2 } -$ between NH-COO- and hexatomic ring,and the protons on hexatomic ring connected to NH-COO- appear at $3 . 7 4 ~ \mathrm { p p m }$ ,indicating the reactions of IPDI with co-PLAol and the chain extender. Furthermore,the protons on the chain extenders have also been assigned in Fig. 2.

The above results demonstrate that the bio-PUs with different chain extenders were successfully prepared. The thermal, mechanical and shape memory properties of the obtained bio-PUs would be discussed in the following sections.

# 3.2Thermal and mechanical properties of bio-PUs

Fig.3 displays the DSC curves of the obtained bio-PUs with differentchain extenders,and their $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ values are listedin Table 2. All synthesized bio-PUs show only one $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ but no melting or crystallization peaks in the DsC curves，suggesting that the synthesized bio-PUs were amorphous. As the carbon chain length of the chain extender increases from bio-PU-EG to bioPU-DDO，the $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ values decrease from $3 4 . 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $2 8 . 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ possibly due to the increase of the chain flexibility. The $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ value of bio-PU-CHDM is $3 4 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ as same as bio-PU-EG.For amorphous PUs, $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ serves as the shape transition temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } } \right)$ .34,35 Hence,it is clear that the $T _ { \mathrm { t r a n s } }$ values of all synthesized bio-PUs are very closed to body temperature.These synthesized bio-PUs are expected to have many applications in medical devices.

The thermal stability of bio-PUs was investigated by TGA. Fig.4 shows the TGA weight loss curves of the obtained bio-PUs, and their weight loss temperatures are summarized in Table 2.

@ $R _ { \mathrm { b } }$ is the recovery rate of the samples measured in the next 15 s after the break during tensile tests.

From Table 2, the $T _ { 5 \% }$ and $T _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ of all synthesized bio-PUs are above 200 and $3 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,respectively,suggesting a good thermal stability of these PUs.Moreover，the bio-PU-CHDM exhibits better thermal stability than other bio-PUs,because of the richer cyclic component in its main chain.36

Fig.5 shows the typical stress-strain curves of the synthesized bio-PUs from different chain extenders.A yielding could be obviously observed before break.Table 2 summarizes specific tensile strength,elongation and Young's modulus of each PU.From Table 2，all the bio-PUs have low Young's modulus $\left( 3 4 . 7 ~ \mathrm { { M P a } } \right)$ and high elongation $\left( 4 3 4 . 0 \% \right)$ . The tensile strengthof thesePUsis $2 . 3 { - } 3 . 2 \ \mathrm { M P a }$ .Except for bio-PU-EG, the elongations ofallbio-PUsrange from $3 7 2 . 6 \%$ to $4 3 4 . 0 \%$ .Asthe carbon chain length of the chain extender increases frombioPU-EG to bio-PU-BDO,the elongation increases from $2 6 1 . 3 \%$ to $4 3 4 \%$ ,which is ascribed to the short carbon chain of EG, resulting in poor flexibility of the PU chains.However, the further increase of carbonchain length of thechain extender leads to the increase of hard segment content (HS,see Table 1), and hence the decrease of the elongation.

# 3.3Shape memory properties of bio-based polyurethanes

Cyclic tensile testing was used to characterize the shape recovery properties of the bio-PUs with different chain extenders.Fig.6 displays the cyclic tensile curves of these samples with a $2 0 0 \%$ constant strain,and their recovery rates of each cycle are summarized in Table3.We can see that the recovery rates of all samples increase with cyclic number and almost keep constant after the second cycle,which had been reported by other researchers.37,38 This result is due to that weak physical cross-linking points such as hydrogen bond were destructed in the first cycle,resulting in a permanent deformation,and the PUs almost formed an ideal elastomeric network after the first two cycles.9,4o Therefore, the synthesized bio-PUs exhibit a recovery rate higher than $9 0 \%$ after the following cycles.

Fig.8 Recovery process of shape memory bio-PU-CHDM at $3 7 ^ { \circ } C$

Moreover, the recovery rate of the first cycle increases with theincrease of the carbon chain length of the chain extender. Thisis because the bio-PU from the chain extender with the long carbon chain length has a lower $T _ { \mathrm { g } } ,$ leading to lower permanent deformation. For all synthesized bio-PUs, their $T _ { \mathrm { g } ^ { \mathrm { S } } }$ are higher than the testing temperature $( 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } )$ ，resulting in relatively high permanent deformationand lowrecoveryrate of the first cycle.Compared with other bio-PUs,the bio-PU-CHDM exhibits better shape recovery properties. It has been reported that the increase of the micro-phase separation in PUs facilitates to improve the shape-memory properties.1,41 Fig.7 shows the phase morphology of the obtained bio-based shape memory PUs from tapping mode AFM. Previous researchers had proved that soft segments correspond to darker regions and hard segments to bright regions in the phase images.42-44 From the imagesofAFM,as the carbonchainlength of the chain extender increases from bio-PU-EG to bio-PU-DDO，the micro-phase separation becomes more developed.This demonstrates that the bio-PU from the chain extender with long carbon chain length shows better shape-memory properties.Although the micro-phase separation of the bio-PU-CHDM is considerable with bio-PU-DDO, the higher shape recovery properties of the bio-PU-CHDMmay originate from the asymmetrical non-planar ring structure of CHDM acting as“molecular spring",which could absorb the external stress and stabilize the physical crosslinks.45

Furthermore,the shape memory properties of the synthesized bio-PUs at body temperature are also measured.Fig.8 exhibits the shape recovery process of bio-PU-CHDM at body temperature $( 3 7 \ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } )$ .The sample was changed into a bending shape at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ and then cooled rapidly to room temperature and it reached the original shape state in $1 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } .$ Similarly, therecovery time of bio-PU-BDO is about $2 \ : \mathrm { m i n }$ .As the carbon chain length of the chain extender increases,the recovery time decreases.Moreover, the recovery rate of the broken samples $\left( R _ { \mathrm { b } } \right)$ was also used to characterize the shape memory properties, as listed in Table 3.The bio-PU-CHDM shows the highest shape recovery rate $( 9 2 \% )$ .These results further indicate that the nonplanar ring structures in the hard segments have a positive effect on the shape memory.

# 4. Conclusions

A series of bio-based shape memory PUs from polylactide copolymer diols and different chain extenders were successfully synthesized and characterized.The bio-based PUs have low Young's modulus $\left( 3 4 . 7 ~ \mathrm { { M P a } } \right)$ and high elongation $( 4 3 4 . 0 \% )$ . As the carbon chain length of the chain extender increased from bio-PU-EG to bio-PU-DDO, the $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ values decreased and micro phase separation became more developed，leading to the improvement of the shape-memory properties.The bio-PU with the non-planar ring structure of CHDMdisplays a highest shape recovery rate.All the synthesized bio-based PUs exhibit good shape memory behavior at the body temperature,which are promisinglyapplied in manymedical devices.
