# INTRODUCTION

Protein particles,consisting of aggregated protein and possiblya nonprotein nucleating core,can form in biopharmaceutical drugs.1,2 Stresses that can lead to the formation of protein particles include changes in chemical environment,exposure to interfaces,agitation,elevationof temperature,or the introduction of nonprotein particles.3-7 Counting and characterizling these particles is necessary to assure the quality of these drugs.Although the size of aggregated proteins may vary from 10s of nanometers to 1oos of micrometers,the most sensitive lanalytical techniques cover the approximate range from 1 to $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ .3,8

In contrast to possible nonprotein impurities (e.g.，glass chips,stainless steel particles,and fbers）protein particles have low optical contrast (equivalent to a small refractive index difference from the matrix fluid) and are subject to dynamic changes in size and concentration as particles are formed or dissolve back into solution.3,9,10 Industry has made great strides in adopting new technologies to count protein particles routinely down to sizes of approximately $2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,but particle counts obtained with different types of instruments often differ by as much as a factor of $1 0 . ^ { 1 1 , 1 2 }$ Particle counting instruments are commonly calibrated using polystyrene latex(PSL) beads, which have high optical contrast and spherical shape; the observed count discrepancies indicate that instrument calibrations with PSL beads do not suffice to standardize instrument response to protein particles.

Comparison of analytical measurements of particle size and counthas beenhampered by the instabilityof the protein particles themselves,which can aggregate further on shipping or revert back to smaller aggregates or monomer protein molecules. As an alternate path to producing a suitable reference material, the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) isdevelopingareference material comprising irregularparticles of a low-refractive index fluoropolymer, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE).The morphology and optical contrast of this material closely resembles that of typical protein particles.

As an initial step in implementing this reference material and to assess the level of agreement among different laboratories,NIST has conducted an interlaboratory comparison for sizing and counting subvisible particles from 1 to $2 5 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ ，using a polydisperse polymer suspension that closely mimics actual protein particles.As listed in Table 1, a total of 23 laboratories participated,including 15 from biopharmaceutical manufacturers,one from biomedical device manufacturers,two from instrumentation manufacturers, three from government laboratories,and two from academic laboratories.

This paper describes the design,production,and characterization of the particles (section Materials and Methods);gives an overview of the bias between different counting methods (section Results and Discussion);and then discusses results for the four methods8,13 used by participants: flow imaging,12 light obscuration, electrical sensing zone (ESZ),14,15 and resonant mass measurement $( \mathrm { R M M } ) ^ { 1 6 }$ (sections Overview and Identificationof Outliers to Resonant MassMeasurement).Sections

Particle Morphology and Resonant Mass Measurement also describe an initial attempt to adjust the reported diameter ofESZ instruments to be equivalent to the diameter reported by flow imaging instruments.

The results give a snapshot of the level of agreement between different laboratories for the particle counting methods in common use today in the biopharmaceutical industry. As expected from published results on protein particles,particle counts differed significantly depending on the counting method.For each specific method, statistically significant deviations were observed primarily because of differences in instrument response.There were also several outliers ( ${ \sim } 1 0 \%$ of the reported data) likely related to insufficient resuspension of the ETFE particles and contamination of the ETFE particles by debris from vial-thread abrasion.Surprisingly,data obtained bylight obscuration agreed well for small diameter particles [relative standard deviation(RSD) of ${ < } 2 6 \%$ for lower diameter limits from 1 to $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } } ]$ ,but the level of agreement was significantly worse forlarge particles.For flow imaging,there were statistically significant differences between data sets acquired on different instrument models,resultinginalarge variability of counts (RSD values of $3 3 \% - 6 1 \%$ for all flow imaging data). For specified instrument settings and models,the variability was reduced,with RSD values of $1 3 \% - 4 9 \%$ over the full size range of the comparison.ESZ instruments gave anomalously high counts for the lowest diameterlimits.

# MATERIALSANDMETHODS

# Preparationof the Particle Suspension

The samples circulated for testing consisted ofa polydisperse suspensionof particles created fromthepolymerETFE.ETFE is attractive because it has low refractive index17 $( \approx 1 . 4 0$ ,similar to that of protein films adsorbed on surfaces18)and is chemically inert and mechanically strong.19

The particles were produced by abrading a solid polymer sample ofETFE against a diamondlappingdisc.Although the process of producing the ETFE particles in no way corresponds to the aggregation mechanism of actual protein particles,the morphologyof the ETFE particlesisremarkably similar to protein particles.Thus,the ETFE particles can serve as a surrogate to actual protein particles,with similar morphology and optical contrast.Like actual protein particle suspensions,but unlike PSL standards,the ETFE suspensions are polydisperse, with particles ranging in approximate sizes from greater than $5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ down to less than $0 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ：

We produced polydisperse ETFE particles by first abrading ETFE against a diamond abrasive ( $4 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ nominal grit size, nickel bonded to a compliant backing)while submersed in an aqueous solution of $0 . 0 3 \mathrm { m o l / L }$ 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin1-yllethanesulfonic acid (HEPES） and $0 . 1 \%$ mass concentration sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS) buffered to $\mathrm { \ p H \ 6 }$ (we intended to use $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 5$ ,but inadvertentlyused a $\mathrm { p H } 6$ buffer for the particle fabrication).At approximately $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ intervals, the particle suspension was withdrawn by pipette from the well holding the abrasive disc.To prevent clogging of analytical instruments,large particles were filtered out by passing the suspension through a nylon screen with nominal $5 3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ square openings.The nylon screen did not shed an appreciable number of particles if it was securely mounted,not folded or manipulated during the filtering process,and thoroughly rinsed with particle-free water prior to use.As harvested, the particle count was too high for direct measurement in some instruments. The suspension was diluted to the desired particle count with additional HEPES/SDS solution buffered to a $\mathbf { p H }$ of 7.5.Prior to use, the HEPES/SDS solution was filtered through a $0 . 4 5 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ PVDF syringe filter (Millex-HV; EMD Millipore,Billerica,

Massachusetts).(Certain commercial equipment,instruments, ormaterials are identified in this document.Such identificationis not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology,nor is it intended to imply that the products identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.) The large concentration of SDS proved necessary to promote dispersion of the highly hydrophobic ETFE particles:measurements on suspensions with an SDS concentration below $0 . 0 3 \%$ mass concentration had poorrepeatability.

The suspension was packaged in perfluorinated alkoxy (PFA) screw-top vials with flat interior bottoms.PFA has several desirableattributes.First,PFA,with itslowrefractive index (1.34),does not produce thread debris of high optical contrast onrepeated opening and closing of the vials.Second, the PFA vialshave minimalleachates.Initial studies with glass screwtop vials revealed unacceptable quantities of debris created by friction between the screw top and the vial. Studies with polypropylene vials revealed that strong agitation (necessary to resuspend the ETFE particles) would produce long-lasting, vesicle-like droplets,likely asa result of combining SDS with organic leachates.These observations motivated the switch to the more expensive PFA vials.

Transfer ofhomogeneous aliquots ofETFE solution to a large number of vials is hamperedbythe fast settling of the ETFE particles relative to PSL beads.The ETFE particles were maintained in suspension in a $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ , open-top PFA jar byplacing fourstainless steel bafles around the periphery of the jar and then stirring at 2OO revolutions per minute.20 From this stirred jar, the suspension could be transferred by pipet into the PFA vials.Once in the vials, the suspension was further diluted by addition of the $0 . 0 3 \ \mathrm { m o l / L }$ HEPES, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 5$ ， $0 . 1 \%$ mass concentration SDS solution.

The threaded joint of the PFAvials canleak because of cold flow of the PFAover the course of several days.To prevent this problem,the vials were tightened after sitting overnight,and againafter 7 days from the filling date.Rocking the lids back and forth while tightening also helped to promote a tight seal. Participants weighed the vials on receipt to ensure that the vials had not leaked during shipping; all vials were successfully shipped without leakage.

The vials were stored and shipped to participants at ambient temperature.

# Characterization of the Particle Suspension

# VariabilityoftheParticleConcentration

Oninitial production, there are vial-to-vial variations in particle count because of irrepeatability of the dispensing and diluting process.After initial production, there are several potential mechanisms for further changes of the particle size distribution.As examples,agitation because of shipping or resuspension can potentially either break apart particles or cause abrasion of the PFA vials; sedimentation and natural convection can lead to entanglement of particles;and resealing the threaded closures can add abraded PFA particles.

To quantify vial-to-vial variations and possible changes in particle size distribution during storage, five vials were measured by light obscuration over a 3-month period corresponding to the period of data collection by the participants.Changes in particle size distribution were estimated from the changes observed fora single vial shipped from Maryland to California and back again.Separate experiments were conducted to repeatedlyreseal threevials(which canlead to creationof thread debris),and measure the particle size distribution periodically by both light obscuration and flow imaging,fora total of30 sealing cycles.The vial stability tests were conducted with multiple vials,opened at staggered time points,to reduce the effects of vial resealing on the stability test.

From the variations observed in these experiments,the standard uncertainty was determined for each effect,which is equivalent to the expected variations of any one vial from the mean of all vials at a confidence limit of $68 \%$ (i.e.,equivalent to one standard deviation).The combined uncertainty $u _ { \mathrm { c } }$ (i.e., the uncertainty attributed to all terms)was calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of all uncertainty components.(The results of this analysis are given in the Supplementary Information as Table S1.) The value of $u _ { \mathrm { c } }$ is an acceptable $8 \%$ for particle concentrations with a lower size limit of $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ or lower.For higher limits, $u _ { \mathrm { c } }$ climbs to $1 9 \%$ at a lower limit of $2 5 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ . The larger value of $u _ { \mathrm { c } }$ for a lower limit of $2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ results at least in part from the low particle concentration in that size range,with $N \approx 8 0 \ \mathrm { m L ^ { - 1 } }$ $( \mathrm { m } \mathbf { L } ^ { - 1 }$ is the unit symbol designating units of particles per milliliter).This low value increases the impact of small numbers of additional contaminants.

Although the stability of the ETFE particle suspension was sufficient for the purposes of this comparison,some drift in results were noted by both NIST and one participant.Part of this observed drift is likely because of thread debris,as discussed in section Overview and Identification of Outliers.One possible additional source of drift is microbial growth:despite the abilityof SDS to denature proteins,bacteria have been observed to degrade SDS at concentrations in excess of the $0 . 1 \%$ mass concentration used here.21,22 Subsequent to the data acquisition phase of the comparison,a stability test was initiated on ETFE particle suspensions of similar particle size distribution,but withtheadditionof $0 . 0 2 \%$ mass concentration of sodium azide and with greater care in filtration of the buffer. The stability of this secondlot over 6.5 monthswas a factor of1.9 better than the stability of the comparison lot over 3 months (data not shown).

# ParticleMorphology

We examined the particle morphology using both optical and electron microscopy. Examples of both types of images are shown in Figure 1.Optical images of the ETFE particles were acquired in suspension,using a flow imaging system with $1 0 \times$ magnification and a $1 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ thick flow cell.

Optical imaging of the ETFE particles is limited by the resolution of optical microscopy; scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has the potential of providing images with much higher resolution.However, the particles must be deposited on asubstrate insuchaway that the particles do not agglomerateon drying and must have the high SDS and HEPES concentration washed off. For SEMimaging, the particles were first captured onanodized alumina filters (Anodisc brand;GEHealthcare Bio-Sciences,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania) with $0 . 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ diameter pores.Prior to use,the filterswere first washed with waterand then with a mixture of photoresist remover and ethanol.After oven drying,the filters were sputter coated on both sides with $2 5 \mathrm { n m }$ ofa $\mathbf { A u } / \mathbf { P d }$ alloy. The coated filter was placed on the glassfrit support of a vacuum flask,and $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of water was pipetted onto the top of the filter to formanearly hemispherical“dome” on the hydrophobic $\mathrm { \ A u / P d }$ film,whereas a slight partial vacuum $( { \approx } 1 . 3 \ \mathrm { k P a }$ ，asdeterminedbyavacuummanometer)was applied to the flask,sufficient to draw liquid through the filter at approximately $0 . 6 ~ \mathrm { m L / m i n }$ .A $1 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { L }$ sample of the ETFE suspension was slowly pipetted into the center of the dome; as the dome returned to an approximate volume of $3 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ ofwater was slowly pipetted into the top of the dome. This process was repeated until the desired particle count was achieved.The particles were then rinsed by1O successive additions of $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of water. After the rinse step, the vacuum was maintained to draw the water fully through the filter.Following drying of the filterin place,the filter was removed and a $\mathsf { 2 5 - n m }$ top coat of $\mathbf { A u } / \mathbf { P d }$ film was sputter deposited.SEM images were obtained on a Zeiss scanning electron microscope at an electron energy of $5 \mathrm { \ k e V , }$ with both in-lens and conventional secondary electron detectors.Dispersive X-ray analysis conducted on the SEM confirmed that we were imaging fluorocarbon particles.

Inspection of the microscopic images shows them to be irregular and somewhat fibrous.We wished to characterize the average fraction of solid ETFE within the overall envelope of the particle,in anticipation that this packing fraction would helpus understand differences in the particle counts obtained by different methods.The technique of quantitative phase microscopy23.24 produces a phase map of the apparent optical phase difference $\phi ( x , y )$ ，which is proportional to the difference in optical thickness between the particle and the matrix liquid:

$$
\varphi ( x , y ) = \frac { 2 \pi \Delta n _ { \mathrm { E } } z _ { \mathrm { E } } } { \lambda _ { 0 } } ,
$$

where $\Delta n _ { \mathrm { E } }$ is the refractive index difference between solid ETFE and the matrix liquid, $z _ { \mathrm { E } }$ is the total thickness of ETFE in the vertical $z$ direction, $x$ and $y$ are lateral dimensions in the image plane,and $\lambda _ { 0 }$ is the wavelength of light in vacuum.Integrating Eq.(1) over the whole area of the particle relates the integral of the optical phase difference over the whole particle area, $\Phi$ ,to the total volume displacedby solid ETFE, $V$ 1

$$
\Phi = \frac { 2 \pi \Delta n _ { \mathrm { E } } V } { \lambda _ { 0 } } .
$$

From the literature,the refractive index of ETFE,at the wavelength of $5 2 7 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ used here,is 1.400.17 From measurements witha calibratedAbbe refractometer,the HEPES/SDS buffer has a refractive index of 1.337,giving $\Delta n _ { \mathrm { E } } = 0 . 0 6 3$ in Eqs.(1) and (2).

Published literature for objects with a thickness comparable to the width and length report that correcting phase values from the thin-object algorithm of Paganin and Nugent23 bya factor of either two to five(varying with object size and using white light illumination)24 or one (using highly coherent light).25 In our implementation,we used partially coherent green light at a wavelength of $5 2 7 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .To determine the correction factor, we suspended small glass beads in two liquids (onewith negative $\Delta n$ and one with positive $\Delta n$ )andobtaineda correction factor of $2 . 0 \pm 0 . 1$ (median and standard uncertainty of the median26) that was approximately independent of bead size (see Fig. S1,Supporting Information).

Two of the counting methods reported in this comparison, ESZ and RMM techniques,report equivalent diameters $d _ { \mathrm { V } }$ that are equal to the diameter of a sphere with volume $V$

$$
V = \left( \pi / 6 \right) d _ { \mathrm { V } } ^ { 3 } .
$$

Flowimagingreports an effective diameter, $d _ { \mathrm { F } }$ ,thatiseither an average of dimensional measurements across the optical image or the diameter of a circle with the same area as the imaged particle:

$$
A = \left( \pi / 4 \right) d _ { \mathrm { F } } ^ { 2 } .
$$

The final method, light obscuration,reports a diameter that is based on an angle integration of scattered light,which is not directlyrelated to the physical particle dimensions.

To determine the relation between $d _ { \mathrm { V } }$ and $d _ { \mathrm { F } }$ for the ETFE particles,we obtained brightfield images ona numberof ETFE particles in suspension in the matrix liquid (using Kohler illumination at a wavelength of $5 2 7 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，with a $2 0 \times$ magnification,O.4O numerical aperture objective).As the particles settled to the bottom of the counting chamber, the long axis of the particles was approximately normal to the optical axis. Thus,the particles were similar in orientation to particles that werealigned along the flow direction in the flow cell of a particle counter.Wedenote the effectivediameter ofalignedand randomly oriented particles as $d _ { \mathrm { F , A } }$ and $d _ { \mathrm { F , R } }$ ,respectively. Direct analysis of the brightfield images using ImageJ software27 gave the projected area of each particle,andbyEq.(4),avalue of $d _ { \mathrm { F , A } }$ .Quantitative phase analysis of two images obtained at a focal plane difference of $2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ gave the phase map $\phi ( x , y )$ from which we obtained $d _ { \mathrm { V } }$ by Eqs.1-3.From an analysis of 80 particles ranging in diameter from 2 to $2 9 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ，wedetermined that the average ratio $d _ { \mathrm { V } } / d _ { \mathrm { F , A } }$ varied smoothly from a value of $0 . 9 0 \pm 0 . 1 0$ (mean and standard error of the mean for13 particles)at $2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ diameter to $0 . 5 1 \pm 0 . 0 2$ (mean and standard error of the mean for 10 particles)at $2 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ diameter.Forrandomly oriented particles,there is a small correction because of the difference between the average cross-sections of a randomly oriented particle and the cross-section of an aligned particle. Approximating the particles as prolate spheroids with aspect ratio $\eta \approx 0 . 6$ (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Information) gives a ratio28 $d _ { \mathrm { F , A } } / d _ { \mathrm { F , R } } = \eta ^ { - 1 / 6 } = 1 . 0 8$ as a correction factor to convert $d _ { \mathrm { V } } / d _ { \mathrm { F , A } }$ to $d _ { \mathrm { V } } / d _ { \mathrm { F , R } }$ ：

# AbsoluteParticleConcentration

For the purposes of the present interlaboratory comparison, we did not determine a particle size distribution traceable to the International System of Units.To do so requires careful development of techniques to size and count particles with minimal bias. On successful development of appropriate techniques,we plan to release this ETFE suspension asa reference material certified for particle size distribution and morphological properties such as the average aspect ratio.

# Comparison Protocol

The testing of the ETFE particles was much more challenging to the participatinglaboratories than measurement of commercial PSL-bead count standards.The participants were not given the particle count or the particle size distribution,and the polydisperse nature of the sample made it hard to distinguish true particles from any contaminants or other source of spurious counts.In this regard,measurement of the ETFE was very similar to measurement of an actual biotherapeutic candidate or product.The protocol and data reporting template did not specifythe type of instrumentation to be used for this,although the template did include columns already set up for the two most prevalent methods:flow imaging and light obscuration.

One parameterinwhich the ETFEdiffers substantially from PSL beads is its high density,which causes ETFE particles to sediment much faster than PSL beads of the same hydrodynamic radius.To mitigate this effect,guidance on methods toreduce sedimentation effects was distributedto the participants.

The high density of the ETFE,combined with the irregular morphology, can lead to entanglement of the ETFE particles following sedimentation.Prior experiments at NIST demonstrated that the best method to resuspend particles was to hold the vials horizontally and then shake vigorously for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { s }$ This method resuspended particles much more effectively than either sonication or vortexing. The protocol (see the Supporting Information） gave instructions to the participants on this resuspension technique.

To maintain confidentiality, all data were submitted to a third-party data handling organization,which submitted anonymous data to NIST.Data was reported by the participants usinga spreadsheet template.The template included columns for instrumentation type and settings,the particle concentrations for equivalent diameters equal to or greater than 1,2,5, 10,15,20,and $2 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,andstandarddeviationsof theobtained concentrations.

# RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

# Overview and Identification of Outliers

Of the 24 laboratories reporting data,data from 22 laboratories are fully reportedhere,along withhalf the data fromone other laboratory.Complete records of all 24 data setsare available in the Supporting Information (round 1 data sets); data sets are identified by the laboratory code assigned by the data-handling organization.In some cases,laboratories reported data for multiple instruments of the same type (e.g., flow imaging microscopes)but different models; these reported values were treated asindependent data sets.

Data from three laboratories were identifiedas outliers (laboratory codesB4893,B2899,andH2894; full data sets included in Supporting Information).For laboratory code B2899,the counts were consistentlyhigh for three different counting methods,indicating some contamination or failure of the transfer standard.In an effort to identify the cause of the discrepancy, an additional sample of ETFE (labeled as round 2 in the Supporting Information) was sent to this laboratory.The laboratory returned both the data reporting sheet anda detailed sheet of raw data.From the raw data,it became apparent that this participant acquired more replicates than almost all other participants and that the anomalies were greatest at large particle size and near the end of the sample volume.This pattern is consistent with contamination of the sample with thread debris.Themagnitude of the effectis largerthanincludedin the uncertainty budget for two reasons:the number of replicates was quite high,and the NIST experiments did not draw down the sample volume as rapidly as the B2899 experiments (as the sample volume decreases,a given amount of added thread debris will have a larger proportional effect).To mitigate the effects of thread debris on this data set,we included only the first set of three replicates obtained by B2899. On doing so, this data set was no longer an outlier.

For laboratory code H2894,counts were especially high at large diameter limits for flow imaging,but not for light obscuration.Inspection of the dates of data acquisition revealed that the flow imaging data were taken after a large volume of the sample was used for light obscuration data.On the basis of the pattern of discrepancies,which was similar to that observed with B2899,it is possible that the H2894 flow imaging data set was similarly affected by thread debris.Flow imaging data for H2894 was not included in the analysis below.

Finally, forlaboratory code B4893,particle counts were consistently low for both flow imaging and light obscuration.Insufficient resuspension of the ETFE particles mayhave caused these low counts.Data for B4893 were not included in the analysis below.Additional observations about the various data sets and sources of discrepancies are discussed in the sections below.

The predominant methods used by the participants were light obscuration (19 data sets） and flow imaging (25 sets). Three laboratories also measured the suspension using ESZ instruments (commonly known as Coulter counters),and one laboratory reported data using resonance mass measurement. Figure 2 and Table 2 present the average of the cumulative particle concentration $N$ (i.e.,count per milliliter for particles greater than or equal to the indicated diameter) and the relative standard deviation among the laboratories for the 2O data sets,for these four particle counting methods.

Figure 2.Unweighted means of the cumulative particle concentrationNasa function of the lower diameter limit $d$ for four particle counting methods.Error bars indicate standard deviations of the reported datasets,and the number of data sets in each average is reported in parenthesis.

As expected,the light obscuration values lie considerably lower in count than the flow imaging values.The cause of this reduced count is known to be because of the small refractive index difference between the particles and the matrix fluid,which leads to the light obscuration instruments reporting diameter values that are lower than observed by flow imaging.10.29 For theETFE particles used in this comparison,light obscuration undersizes the particlesbyapproximatelya factor of two,relative to flow imaging. This factor can be determined by finding the ratio of flow imaging diameter to light obscuration diameter fora fixed particle concentration.

# Flow Imaging

The comparison data included data from multiple models of flow imaging systems manufactured by two companies (see Fig.3).Participants obtained data using a wide range of systemmagnification ( $\mho$ to $2 0 \times )$ ,flow cell depth $( 8 0 - 4 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } } )$ 5 andparticleidentificationalgorithms.

As a result of differences between instrument response, the RSD values for all of the combined flow imaging data sets ranged from $33 \%$ to $61 \%$ ,aslisted in Table 3.Selected data sets showed better RSD values.For instruments from manufacturer A,RSD values ranged from $21 \%$ to $3 6 \%$ 1 $( n = 1 8 )$ ，， even with flow cells of both 10O and $4 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ thickness and severalmagnifications.Forinstruments frommanufacturerB, with $1 0 \times$ magnification,capture thresholds that selected both dark and light pixels,and 80 or $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ flow cell thickness $\cdot _ { n }$ $= 4 \dot { }$ ,RSDvaluesrangedfrom $38 \%$ to $4 9 \%$ .Weappliedatwotailed,unpaired $T -$ -test toascertainthe statistical significance of the apparent differences in counts obtained from these two restricted data sets.For diameter limits of $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and larger, the $t$ -test showed statistical significance at greater than $9 5 \%$ confidence (i.e., $p < 5 \%$ ）

Figure 3.Flow imaging data for the cumulative particle concentration $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ asafunction of the lower diameter limit $d$ .Dataobtainedfrom manufacturerAinstruments are red-filled diamonds and solid lines for $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ thick flow cells and red open diamonds and dashed lines for $4 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ thick flow cells.Data from manufacturer B instruments are black dots and solid lines for $1 0 \times$ magnification and known dark and light thresholds applied; black circles and dashed lines for $1 0 \times$ magnification and dark only or unknown thresholds;and blue squares and lines for $2 0 \times$ magnification.Each symbol reports the mean of multiple measurements obtained by the reporting laboratory for each data set; errorbarsare omitted forclarity,but repeatability valuesmaybe found in the Supporting Information.

Formanufacturer B,many of the instruments had variable detection thresholds and user-specified focus.Referring to Figure 3(open black circles),two data sets using manufacturer B instruments at $1 0 \times$ magnification and either dark threshold only or unidentified threshold had counts that were very close to those of manufacturer A results,whereas four of five data sets with both dark and light threshold settings gave counts significantly higher than manufacturer A instruments. This suggests that standardization of threshold settings may be useful inachieving betterreproducibilitybetween laboratories.

Two data sets using an instrument from Manufacturer B set up with $2 0 \times$ magnification gave counts for larger particles considerably lower than other data sets obtained using $1 0 \times$ magnification (blue symbols in Fig.3).A possible reason for this discrepancy is that the short depth of field of the $2 0 \times$ objective,coupled with the irregular,low-contrast nature of the ETFE particles led to particles far from the focal plane not being detected.

Flow imaging instruments are capable of measuring a large numberofmorphologicalparameters forparticleslarger than the optical resolution of the system.The data reporting template included an option to report the average measured aspect ratio for the different size bins.The reported values agree quite well except forone outlier. Standard deviations for the different size ranges varied from O.O4 to O.18 with the outlier included, or from O.04 to O.07 for all the data (see Table S2 in the SupplementaryInformation).No statisticallysignificant difference wasobservedbetweenresultsobtained withdifferentmanufacturer's instruments.The aspect ratio values(O.62 forparticles larger than $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m } ,$ clearlyindicatethenonsphericalnatureof the ETFE particles.

Two participants (A2813 and L2493) obtained data using robot-loaded flow imaging systems. The robotic systems have automated sample stirring,priming of the flow cell,and measurement of particles.At the beginning of the comparison,it wasnot clearwhether the standard instrumentation software could accommodate the ETFE standards,given the tendency of the ETFE to sediment.In fact,these data sets showed excellent repeatability, with RSD varying from $2 \%$ to $9 \%$ . One other participant(W2481） submitted two sets of data obtained by loading two flow imaging systems from a continuously stirred, open syringe,obtainingdataconsistent withotherdata sets.

Comparison participants voiced concerns over sedimentationof the ETFE.Sedimentation velocity of a spherical body increases as the square of the diameter. Consequently, neglecting the impact of variations in geometry with particle size,a $2 5 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ particle would have a sedimentation velocity 2.8 times larger than a $1 5 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ particle.Examining how the deviations of outlier data sets varied with diameter showed no obvious patterns characteristic of errors that would scale as $d ^ { 2 }$ ：

The repeatability reported by each participating laboratory $\mathrm { ( R S D } _ { i } ,$ ）was excellent for the full range of diameterlimits reported (see Table S3 in the Supplementary Information).

# Light Obscuration

Light obscuration was the second most common method reportedby the comparison participants,with19 data sets,after flowimaging.Because of the small refractive index difference betweenETFEandthebuffersolution( $\Delta n \approx 0 . 0 4 )$ ,lightobscuration reported significantly fewer counts than flow imaging or ESZ techniques.10,29 All of the data were obtained with instruments from two manufacturers,with several instrument models for each manufacturer. The instruments of one manufacturerhadalowerdiameterlimitof $1 . 3 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ .Severalparticipants reported the measured values for this limit,but dataare not discussed further as this diameterlimit was not one of the values on the data reporting template.

Asseen in Figure 4 and Table 4,and confirmed bya twotailed $t$ -test,therewereno statisticallysignificantdifferences between data obtained from the two brands of instruments, over the full diameter range of the comparison.Plotting the data did reveal that data obtained with sensorheads designed for a 2 to $4 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ diameter particle size had significantly poorer reproducibility than sensorheads designed for particles smaller than $1 5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ diameter. One participant (B2899,round 2) measured a second sample of ETFE on two instruments that had different sensor model numbers but the same nominal 2-400 $\mu \mathrm { m }$ diameterrange.This singlelaboratoryobtained counts that differed by overa factor of1O(Supporting Information,round 2 data sheets,B2899-2).Furtherwork should be carried out to understand why the reproducibility varies so much with relatively minor changes in sensor geometry.

One participant (B2188) obtained data at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and obtained particle concentrations that were anomalously low for large particle sizes.This effect is likely the result ofETFE sedimentation.

As noted in Results and Discussion,the light obscuration counters report an effective diameter that is approximately a factor of two smaller than the diameter reported from flow imaging.Thus,a lower apparent diameter limit of $2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ for alight obscuration measurement corresponds to a physical diameterofapproximately $5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ .As the ETFE suspension was filtered through a nominal $5 3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ screen in its preparation, the total count of particles with a $2 5 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ lower diameter limit is nearly zero.

Figure5. $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ values versus $1 / \mathrm { P } ^ { 1 / 2 }$ for both flow imaging(a)and light obscuration(b) data,where $\mathrm { \bf P }$ is the number of particles measured per replicate.The solid line represents the expected $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ values because of counting fluctuations alone,and the dashed line represents the upper bound for the contribution of counting fluctuations to ${ \mathrm { R S D } } _ { i }$ at $p < 5 \%$ for three replicates.

The low-residual standard deviations for small diameter values appear to be counterintuitive,as light obscuration counters are known to have sensitivity to the optical properties of particles for diameters below approximately $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ (which is one justificationwhy $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ isspecifiedas thelowerdiameterlimit in pharmacopeial methods3o),which leads to inaccurate counts even forparticles ofhigh optical contrast.For transparent particles withlowoptical contrast,such as protein orETFE particles, light obscuration has poor accuracy for all diameter limits(see Fig.S2 in the Supporting Information).Note,however, that the RSD between data sets is not a measure of the accuracy of the reported counts,but is instead a measure of the reproducibility of counts among similar instruments. The smaller RSD values at small diameter limits may occur because small particles scatter light over a broader angle than large particles; the instrument response may be less sensitive to details of aperture size and focus and alignment of the beam and flow cell.

The good agreement betweenlaboratories foralower diameter limit down to $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ demonstrates that light obscuration measurements can provide arepeatable,but not accurate,measure of particle concentration down to sizes much smaller than the ${ \bf 1 0 - \mu \ m }$ lowerlimit of pharmacopeial methods for samples of fixed optical contrast and morphology.30

The repeatability achieved by individual participants using light obscuration (see Table S4 in the Supplementary Information) appears to be significantly worse than that achieved with flow imaging,especially at large diameter limits.However, the poor repeatability in this case is partly because of undersizing of particles by light obscuration and the correspondingly low values of $N$ at diameter limits of $1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and greater. At diameter limits of $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ or smaller,which corresponds to an equivalent physical diameter limit of approximately $2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ or smaller, $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ values for light obscuration are less than $16 \%$ for $7 5 \%$ of participants.

# Statistical Variations of Light Obscuration and Flow Imaging Data

The particle size distribution of the ETFE suspension was constrained by several factors.First, to provide a realistic simulation of protein particles, the particle size distribution should rapidly decrease with increasing values of diameter. Second, for some light obscuration instruments commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry,an error of $2 1 0 \%$ occurs for particle concentrations of $1 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m L ^ { - 1 } }$ or higher, because of multiple particles traversing the sensing zone simultaneously.Finally, thenumberof particleswith $d > 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ must be nearly zero to avoid clogging instrument inlets.A significant consequence of keeping the overall concentration below $1 0 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { m L ^ { - 1 } }$ combined withthe rapid reduction in $N ( d )$ as $d$ increases is that signifcant errors canbe introduced by the limited number of particle counts,especially for size bins of $d \geq 1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and larger.

The $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ because of counting statistics is $1 / P ^ { 1 / 2 }$ ，where $P$ is the number of particles measured per replicate.Figure 5 shows $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ values versus $1 / P ^ { 1 / 2 }$ for both flow imaging(Fig.5a)

and light obscuration (Fig.5b) data.Values for $P$ were calculated from the reported measurement volumes and by assuming sampling efficiencies of $100 \%$ for light obscuration, $8 5 \%$ for flowimaging instruments from manufacturer A,and $3 5 \%$ for flow imaging instruments from manufacturerB.The solid line represents the expected mean $\mathrm { { R S D } } _ { i }$ values because of counting fluctuations, $( 1 0 0 \% ) / P ^ { 1 / 2 }$ . The dashed line represents the upper bound for the contribution to $\mathrm { { R S D } } _ { i }$ from counting fluctuations,at a confidence level of $p \textless 5 \%$ and three replicate measurements (i.e.,F-distribution evaluatedat 2and infinite degrees of freedom,at aconfidence level of $5 \%$ ).Datahaveonly a $5 \%$ likelihood of appearing above this line because of counting fluctuations alone.

For the flow imaging data set, the $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ values are tightly distributed for $d \geq 1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ through $d \geq 1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ data sets.The relative standard error of the mean of $N ( d )$ is obtained by dividing $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ by the square root of the number of replicates; thus,if counting fluctuations contribute less than $30 \%$ to the $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ ,relative SEMvalues of $17 \%$ areachievable with three replicates.Thedata setsfor $d \geq 2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and $d \geq 2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ illustrate that most of theparticipantsachieved ${ \mathrm { R S D } } _ { i }$ valuesat this level for even the largest particle bins.There are two clear outliers well in excess of counting errors for each of these bins,and several points with $\mathrm { R S D } _ { i }$ values near the $p < 5 \%$ line.

For light obscuration, the undersizing of particles combined with the steep drop in the particle size distribution led to small numbers of particles detected.Asaresult,identificationof laboratorieswith poorrepeatabilityis difficult,but the comparison has sufficientlylow countinguncertainties to enable reasonable comparison (i.e.,relative $\mathrm { S E M } < 1 7 \%$ ofaverage $N ( d )$ values for $d \geq 1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ bin and smaller.

Considering future formulations of particle suspensions,a fourfold increase in $N ( d )$ for $d \geq 2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and $d \geq 2 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ would reduce the statistical uncertainty sufficiently to achieve arelative $\mathrm { S E M } < 2 0 \%$ for light obscuration at all size bins and a moreunambiguous identificationof poor repeatability for flow imaging in size bins of $2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and larger.

# ResonantMassMeasurement

One participant reported data using the RMM technique,converting particle mass into an effective diameter using literature values for the ETFE density $( { \approx } 1 7 0 0 \mathrm { k g / m ^ { 3 } } )$ .19Because the ETFE density differs widely from the buffer solution (unlike protein particles in solution),this measurement is not a stringent test of RMM,and the NIST organizers did not anticipate thata test oftheparticlesbyRMMwouldhave particularvalue. However, on considering the data,measurement of ETFE by both RMM and flow imaging may provide a very useful crosscheck of flow imaging. The discrepancy between the RMM and flow imaging at the lowest diameter limit $( 1 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ may be a consequence of the reduced visibility of low-contrast particles in flow imaging systems.Further pursuit of this approach may provide a method of validating flow imaging systems near the lowerdiameterlimit of these instruments.One difficultyin the interpretation of the RMM data is that the reported diameteris equal to the diameter of a compact ETFE sphere,which differs from the diameter derived from the projected area by flow microscopy.A challenge in performing RMM on the circulated ETFE suspension is that the particle concentration is too low to give RMM counts withlow statistical uncertainty for the small sample volumes typically used for RMM.The value of $N ( d = 2 \ \mu \mathbf { m } )$ reported in Table 2 for RMMisequivalent to approximately four particles per replicate.

# Electrical Sensing Zone

Two participants reported data using the ESZ technique.A sharp,likely anomalous increase in apparent particle count was observed at diameters near the lower limit of the ESZ instruments,as shown in Figure 6 and Table 5.The lower limit of the ESZ measurements depends on the size of the orifice installed in the instrument,and the anomalous increase shifts with a change in orifice.Similar increases in particle counts have been observed with polydisperse suspensions of actual protein particles.15 Until the cause of the anomalous data can be ascertained,use of the ETFE suspension for ESZ instruments maybe of limited value.

Electrical sensing zone instruments report diameters based on the displaced volume of the particle;in contrast,flow imaging reports a diameter based on the projected area.For the irregular, convoluted morphologies of the ETFE particles, the volume-based diameter can be substantially smaller than the area-based diameter. We attempted to correct this bias using the ratio of these diameters obtained from quantitative phase microscopy,as described in section Particle Morphology.The correctedESZ results,for eitheralignedorrandomly oriented particles,agree well with the flow imaging results for a lower diameter limit of $1 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ or larger,as seen in Figure 7.The method of section Particle Morphology leads to an apparent overcorrection,possibly because the QPI measurements were performed on particles that were stationary on a glass slide. The method of section Particle Morphology assumes that the particle depth is equal to the particle width,butin fact the particles likely settle to the most gravitationally stable position,in which the particle has minimum thickness in the $z$ direction. This settling effect will give a value of $d _ { \mathrm { V } } / d _ { \mathrm { F , R } }$ that is too low.At diameter limits between 1and $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ,the correction increases the discrepancy between the ESZ results and the flow imaging values.

Figure 7. Electrical sensing zone data for $N$ compared with flow imaging data,with and without diameter scaling of the ESZ diameters.Scalingis shown for particles that are randomly aligned (open diamond symbols,dashed lines)and aligned with the flow field(open diamond symbols,dotted lines).For flow imaging,error bars indicate standard errorof the mean for the values reported by multiple laboratories.For ESZ,error bars indicate the standard error of the mean of the two data setsreported for a $1 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ orifice.At $d = 2 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ，theESZ data point indicates only the results of one laboratory with a $5 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ orifice.

Because both RMM and ESZ instruments report an effective diameter based on the displaced volume,it is possible in theory to compare the results of these two types of instruments directly.In the present comparison,however, there is not sufficient overlap of the two data sets to allowa comparison.The one participant reporting RMM results includes data up to a lower diameter limit of $2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,but for this bin only two particles were detected for all three replicates combined,leading to a veryhigh uncertaintyin the particle concentrationat this size. The ESZ data extend down to $1 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ,but thedatafor diameter limit of $1 \mu \mathrm { m }$ are in the anomalous region.We encourage a future comparison between RMM and ESZ in the region of overlap

# CONCLUSIONS

The combined data sets of this comparison provide a wellcontrolled and extensive data set to study discrepancies between the different counting methods.The discrepancies in particle counts of the ETFE suspension by the different measuring methods (a factor of 1O times in the worst cases) were comparable to the discrepancies seen for particles in actual protein solutions.

Selected subsets of the comparison data showed good reproducibility, comparable with the uncertainty of the ETFE suspension.In particular, for light obscuration measurements at a lower diameter limit of $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ , the RSD values were approximately $2 5 \%$ ,and for flow imaging instruments of a single manufacturer, with fixed instrument series,RSD values were approximately $30 \%$ forall diameter limits.These values illustrate that for controlled instrument parameters,good reproducibility of particle counts can be obtained through a broad section of the biopharmaceuticalindustry, device and equipment manufacturers,andacademic and governmentlaboratories.

Better agreement between the different methods,or between instruments of different settings or manufacturer, will be the next challenge.Our partially successful attempt at adjusting theESZ reported diameter to match an area-based diameter is an example of the bias correction methods that need to be developed.

Results of the comparison also provide useful information for the development of ETFE suspensions as a reference material.

The ETFE suspension proved generally useful as a tool to ascertain instrument performance,with the exception ofESZ instruments near the lower limit of the installed orifice.Increasing the particle concentration for particle diameters greater than $1 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ would increase the number of particles measured in the larger size bins,giving measurement results with less variability and reducing the effects of thread debris.The presence of data sets with very low values suggests that the instructions on resuspension of the sample were not clear enough.Sedimentation of the particles may have been a contributing factor as well;we are working with collaborators to mitigate this problem by adding viscosity modifiers to the ETFE suspension.It will also be useful to reinforce in the instructions that resuspension and stirring sample prior to use is necessary. The good success with robotic and continuously stirred samples demonstrated that the ETFE suspension is compatible with advanced samplehandlinginstrumentation.
