# Summary

Keywords:apple (Malusdomestica B.),cytosolic malate dehydrogenase gene,overexpression,salt and cold tolerance,redox state，salicylic acid.

In this study,we characterized the role of an apple cytosolic malate dehydrogenase gene (MdcyMDH) in the tolerance to salt and cold stresses and investigated its regulation mechanism in stress tolerance.The MdcyMDH transcript was induced by mild cold and salt treatments,and MdcyMDH-overexpressing apple plants possessed improved cold and salt tolerance compared to wild-type (WT) plants.A digital gene expression tag profiling analysis revealed that MdcyMDH overexpression largely altered some biological processes,including hormone signal transduction, photosynthesis,citrate cycle and oxidation-reduction.Further experiments verified that MdcyMDH overexpresson modified the mitochondrial and chloroplast metabolisms and elevated the level of reducing power,primarily caused by increased ascorbate and glutathione,as well as the increased ratios of ascorbate/dehydroascorbate and glutathione/glutathione disulphide, under normal and especialy stress conditions. Concurrently,the transgenic plants produced a high $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ content,but a low $\mathsf { O } _ { 2 } ^ { - }$ production rate was observed compared to the WT plants.On the other hand,the transgenic plants accumulated more free and total salicylicacid (SA) than the WT plants under normal and stress conditions.Taken together,MdcyMDH conferred the transgenic apple plants a higher stress tolerance by producing more reductive redox states and increasing the SA level; MdcyMDH could serve as a target gene to genetically engineer salt- and cold-tolerant trees.

# Introduction

Plant tissues possess multiple isoforms of malate dehydrogenase (MDH,EC 1.1.1.37),which belongs to the group of oxidoreductases and catalyses the interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate (OAA) coupled to the reduction or oxidation of the NAD(H) or NADP(H) pool. NAD-dependent MDHs are located in the cytosol and inorganelles,includingplastids，mitochondria, peroxisomes and microbodies;additionally，chloroplasts contain an NADP-dependent MDH (Gietl，1992;Scheibe，2004). In the Arabidopsis genome，eight putative NAD-MDH isoforms have been identified,where two are mitochondrial MDH (mMDH),two are peroxisomal MDH,one isa plastidial MDH,and three have no detectable target sequences and are thought to be cytosolic MDH (cyMDH) (Beeler et al.,2014).

The redox state of the cells is especially critical during exposure to abiotic stresses,which are known to induce oxidative stress at the cellular level; under these conditions,regulation of multiple redox and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals in plants requires a high degree of coordination and balance between the signalling and metabolic pathways in different cellular compartments (Suzuki et al.，2012). In green tissues,an important aspect is the chloroplast/cytosol/mitochondrion cooperation under stress tomodulate cell redox homeostasis (Raghavendra and Padmasree,20o3).MDH reaction is involved in central metabolism and redox homeostasis between organelle compartments (Tomaz et al.，201O).MDH isozymes in the chloroplast inner envelope membrane,stroma,mitochondrial membrane and cytosol are the componentsof malate/OAA and malate/aspartate (Asp) shuttles (malate valves) (Gietl,1992;Taniguchi and Miyake,2012).When plants are subjected to abiotic stresses,changes in the activities of the enzymes of the malate valves and expression levels of the MDH isoforms can be observed (Scheibe，2oo4)，and malate valves play major roles in reductant export under stress conditions (Taniguchi and Miyake，2012).Chloroplast NADP-MDH makes the link between the redox states of the chloroplast and the cytosol and other cell compartments,such as peroxisomes (Heyno et al.，2014).In Arabidopsis，malate/OAA transporter knockout impairs the malate valve function of chloroplasts，and the knockout plants show enhanced photoinhibition and ROS accumulationin response to a high-intensity light,due to a greater accumulation of reducing equivalents in the stroma (Lemaire et al.，1996). Regarding mMDH，its repression modifies the ascorbate-mediated link between the energy-generating processes ofrespiration and photosynthesis (Nunes-Nesi et al., 2005)．Additionally，mMDH lowers leaf respiration and alters photorespiration and plant growth in Arabidopsis (Tomaz et al., 2010).In contrast,cyMDH is thought to function as a key player in the transfer of reducing equivalents from the chloroplast or mitochondria to other destinations in plant cells (Gietl，1992; Hara et al.,2006;Scheibe,2004).

Protein tertiary structures were predicted using the SWISS-MODEL (http:// swissmodel.expasy.org/).Values represent the means $\pm \mathsf { S D }$ of three replicates.

On the other hand,plant hormones play central roles in the ability of plants to adapt to abiotic stresses by mediating a wide range of adaptive responses (Peleg and Blumwald，2011).For example,evidence of the role of salicylic acid (SA) in the oxidative damage generated by NaCl and osmotic stress was reported,and the NPR1-dependent SA signalling pathway was found to play pivotal roles in enhancing salt and oxidative stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Borsani et al.，2oo1; Jayakannan etal.，2015)；in contrast,ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signalling pathways in response to osmotic stress were widely investigated (Yoshida et al.，2014)．Additionally，interactions between hormone and redox signalling pathways can control plant growth and cross-tolerance to stress (Bartoli et al.，2013). Up to now, evidence that cyMDH and other MDHs can enhance plant stress tolerance by regulating redoxand hormone levels,aswell as from their interactions,is still lacking.

Because most of the arable lands are used for growing grain crops，fruit treesare increasingly grown on marginal land. Because fruit trees cannot be rotated to avoid stresses，in contrast to annual crops,they often encounter multiple environmental stresses simultaneously. It has become an emerging challenge for scientists to clarify how fruit trees respond to and grow against adverse environments and to improve the stress tolerance of fruit trees by genetic modification.Presently, it has beenreported thatcyMDH conferssuperiormanganese tolerance by mediating malate synthesis and secretion and inhibiting ROs generation in Stylosanthes guianensis (Chen et al.，2015).Our previous study also showed that MdcyMDH conferred transgenic tomato plants high tolerance to cold and salt stresses alongside with decreased ROS levels (Yao etal.，2011a).However，more researchisneeded to unravel the mechanism of MdcyMDH in regulating abiotic stresses.Therefore,this study isaimed to assess the potential application of MdcyMDH in engineering salt-and cold-tolerant apple trees and to better understand the mechanism of MdcyMDH-mediated abiotic stress tolerance by modifying redox homeostasis and hormone levels.

# Results

# The identification of cyMDH genes and their expression in different tissuesand under coldand salttreatments in apple

Inour previous study (Yao et al.，2008)， the MdcyMDH (DQ221207) ORF was shown to encode a 332-aa polypeptide which shared over $90 \%$ similarity with cyMDHs from other species, but we failed to locate this gene in the present apple genome database.In contrast，the other four cyMDH isoforms were identified from the entire apple genome，and their deduced proteins possessed the highly conserved domains of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (Figure S1).Highly similar protein tertiary structureswereobservedbetweenMdcyMDHand MDP0000174740，as well as between MDP0000197620 and MDP0000926135 (Figure 1a).Transcripts of the five cyMDH genes couldbe detected in all tissues，but they exhibited varying expression levelsin different tissues;MdcyMDH，MDP0000 174740 and MDP0000197620 were expressed primarily in the stemsand roots (Figure 1b,c).MdcyMDH,MDP0000174740 and MDP0o00170418 expression were induced by $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ NaCl and temperatureof $8 ^ { \circ } C$ (Figure 1c).Therefore，MdcyMDH and MDP0000174740 most likely possessed similar functions in thelight of their highly similar tertiary structures,spatial expressions and expression responses to salt and cold in apple.

# Improved tolerance to salt and cold in transgenic apple plants via MdcyMDH overexpression

Tofurther characterize the biological function of the MdcyMDH gene， the MdcyMDH-overexpressing lines were obtained by agrobacterium-mediated transformation and confirmed by PCR detection of the target gene (Figure 2a,b).Lines 5 and 7,with high MdcyMDH expression level compared to the wild-type (WT) plants,were selected to be further assayed (Figure 2b).When subjected to $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ salt and $8 ^ { \circ } C$ stresses,no obvious phenotype differences were observed between the transgenic and WT apple in vitro shoot cultures at 1O days after the treatments;after nine more days of $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ NaCl and seven more days of $0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ treatment,both the transgenic and WT apple cultures showed the necrosis phenotypes,but the transgenic plants exhibited less severe phenotypes (Figure 2d,e). In addition，after 3weeks of NaCl treatment, the leaves of the 3-year-old WT plants exhibited symptom of etiolation and marginal necrosis but the leaves of the transgenic plants exhibited near-to-normal colour (Figure 2g). Moreover,the leaves of the transgenic apple cultures and trees possessed a much higher chlorophyll content than the leaves of the WT plants after the stress treatmentsalthough the chlorophyll contents were reduced in the WT and transgenic plants when subjected to the stress treatments (Figure 2h,i).Therefore, MdcyMDH overexpression enhanced the tolerance of transgenic apple plants to salt and cold stresses.

# Comparison of expression profiles between the WT and MdcyMDH-overexpressing plants

To explore the regulation mechanism of MdcyMDH in abiotic stresses，a digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling analysis between the WT and mixed transgenic plants at $3 h$ after the cold treatment was conducted to quantify gene changes. It was found that 961 and 958 genes were up- and down-regulated by at least onefold in the transgenic lines,respectively,demonstrating that a massive transcriptional reprogramming took place inthe MdcyMDH-overexpressing plants.According to the putative homology to sequences present in public databases,the differentiallyexpressed genes were classified into 12 different cellular component categories; the cytosol contained the most differentiallyexpressed genes $( 4 0 . 1 \% )$ ，followed by the membrane $( 3 3 . 3 \% )$ ，chloroplast $( 6 . 4 \% )$ ，nucleus $( 2 . 8 \% )$ and mitochondria $( 2 . 7 \% )$ (Figure 3a).All of the DGE genes are associated with 22 biological processes.The two processes of plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signal transduction contain the most DGE genes;additionally,photosynthesis,citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and the oxidation-reduction process were also the clearly changed biological processes (Figure 3b).Moreover, the expression levels of the 28 most differentially expressed annotated genes in the coldtreated shoot cultureswere detected by qRT-PCR,which contained genes related to SA biosynthesis and signal transduction,chloroplast and mitochondrial metabolism，redox process and abiotic stresses;similar expression changes to DGE tag profileswere found, validating the reliability of the DGE genes (Figure 3c).Additionally, the 28 genes exhibited similar expression changes under salt treatment as that under cold treatment (Figure 3c). Besides,most of the above genes were induced by cold and/or salt in the WT and transgenic plants (Figure S2).Therefore，itis suggested that MdcyMDH improved the stress tolerance of the transgenic apple plants at least partly via modifying hormone signal transduction, photosynthesis,TCA cycle and the oxidation-reduction process.

# MdcyMDH overexpression modulatedmitochondrial and chloroplast metabolisms

First,MDH activities in the cytosol,mitochondria and chloroplast were detected in the MdcyMDH-overexpressing apple invitro shoot cultures (Figure 4a-c)．The MdcyMDH overexpression increased the reductive activities of cyMDH and chMDH and the oxidative activity of mMDH compared to the WT plants; in contrast,the difference of activities was enlarged and reached a significant level under cold and salt stresses.In contrast，the oxidative activities of cyMDH and chMDH and the reductive activity of mMDH were generally not significantly changed in the

transgenic plants compared to those in the WT plants.Moreover, the reductive activities of cyMDH and chMDH and the oxidative activity of mMDH were clearly induced by cold and salt treatment in the WT and transgenic plants (Figure 4a-c).Therefore,it can be suggested that the increases in the cyMDH and chMDH reductive activities and the mMDH oxidative activity contributed favourably to the stress tolerance of apple plants in the transgenic plants.Moreover， the significantly increased malate content indicated that the reductive activity of MDH was strengthened against its oxidative activity in the transgenic plants under normal and stress conditions (Figure 5a).

Because the MDH activities in the cytosol,mitochondria and chloroplast were altered in the transgenic plants and MDH is one of the components of the malate/OAA shuttle between the cytosol and other organelles，it was speculated that the mitochondrial and chloroplast metabolisms would be changed Toverify this speculation，mitochondrial and chloroplast metabolisms were detected in the WT and transgenic plants under normal and stress conditions. On the one hand，malatedependent oxygen consumption by isolated mitochondria was measured to assess the change in the mitochondrial activity.The results showed that the oxidation capacity of malate was significantly increased in the transgenic plants under cold and salt treatments (Figure 5b)，which was consistent with the increased oxidative activity of mMDH (Figure 4b).On the other hand，parameters related to photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence were determined to assess the changes in chloroplast metabolism in the transgenic plants.The results showed that the NaCl treatment induced a decrease in the photosynthetic rate inthe WT and transgenic plants;nevertheless,the MdcyMDH overexpression produced an increase in the photosynthetic rate and a concomitant increase in the stomatal conductance (Figure 6a,b), suggesting the contribution of stomatal factors to theincreased photosynthetic rate in the transgenic plants. However,similar intercellular ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ concentration in the leaves of the WT and transgenic plants also indicated altered activities of the mesophyll by the MdcyMDH overexpression (Figure 6c). Compared to the WT plants,MdcyMDH overexpression did not significantly influence the photoinhibition of PSll in the light of similarratiosof $F \sqrt { F _ { \mathrm { m } } }$ under normal and salt treatment (Figure 6d; Bjorkman and Demmig，1987);in contrast，MdcyMDH overexpression significantly increased the electron transport rate (ETR), which was used as a quantitative indicator of the electron transport beyond PSll (Maxwell and Johnson，2ooO) (Figure 6e). Additionally， the transgenic plants significantly modified the redox level and excitation pressure of PSll,indicated by thealtered values of 1-qP (Figure 6f;Maxwell and Johnson,20oO). Taken together，the mitochondrial and chloroplast metabolisms were modified in the MdcyMDH-overexpressing plants.

# Overexpression of MdcyMDH increases the reducing power and modifies the ROS level under cold and salt stresses

The three most abundant antioxidants in plant cells,that is NAD $( { \mathsf { P } } ) { \mathsf { H } } .$ ，ascorbate and glutathione (Queval and Noctor,2oo7),and their reductive and oxidized forms were determined in the WT and transgenic plants under normal and stress conditions (Figure 7).MdcyMDH overexpression increased the NADH levels and the ratios of $N A D H / N A D ^ { + }$ although generally not in a statistically significant manner under normal and stress conditions (Figure 7a). In contrast， the NADPH content was slightly enhanced but the ratios of NADPH/NADP+ were almost unchanged(Figure 7b,e). Moreover， accumulation ofboth reduced ascorbate (AsA)and oxidized ascorbate (DHA)was induced by cold and salt stresses (Figure 7c).The contents of both AsA and DHA increased in the transgenic plants compared to the WT plants;additionally,the increments in AsA and AsA/DHA reached statistical significance at most of the treatment points (Figure 7c,e).Similarly,salt and cold induced the accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG)and especially reduced glutathione (GSH);MdcyMDH overexpression significantly promoted the GSH content and GSH/GSSG under stress conditions (Figure 7d,e). Taken together,MdcyMDH overexpression increased the reducingpower predominantly via enhancing the levels of AsA and GSH,as well as the ratios of AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG.

On the other hand, the transgenic lines generated a lower $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ^ { \cdot - }$ production rate but a higher $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ content than the WT plants under normal and stress conditions (Figure 7f).

# The level of SA is elevated in the transgenic plants

To examine whether MdcyMDH overexpression impacted hormone levels，the contents of ABA，IAA， $G A _ { 3 }$ and SA were determined. It was found that IAA and $\mathsf { G A } _ { 3 }$ were not significantly

Moreover, MdcyMDH overexpression did not impact the ratio of free SA in the total SA (Figure $8 \mathsf { b } , \mathsf { c } )$ ：

# Discussion

# cyMDH reaction favours malate synthesis under normal conditions and especially under abiotic stresses

The kinetic properties of recombinant cyMDH proteins showed that the cyMDH reaction favoured malate production in vitro in apple (Yao et al.，2011b)，wheat (Ding and Ma，2004)and pineapple (Cuevas and Podesta，2ooO)．Additionally，it was demonstrated that MdcyMDH promoted malate accumulation in MdcyMDH-overexpressing apple callus (Yao et al.,2011b) and leaves (Figure 5a)．Similarly，malate synthesis was promoted through the overexpression of cyMDH in tobacco and Stylosanthes guianensis (Chen etal.，2015;Wang et al.，201O). Therefore,regeneration of $\mathsf { N A D } ^ { + }$ and malate inside the cytosol was the most primary role of cyMDH,although the enzyme kinetics of the MDH reaction in vivo were affected by substrate/product ratios and the $\mathsf { N A D } ^ { + }$ redox state (Tomaz et al.，2010).Moreover, cyMDH reductive activity increased in response to cold and salt stresses in the WT and transgenic plants (Figure 4a),and cyMDH conferred superior manganese tolerance by increasing malate synthesisin Stylosanthes guianensis (Chen etal.，2015).Therefore,cyMDH primarily catalysed malate synthesis under stresses, and the reaction positively contributed to the tolerance of abiotic stresses.

Because cyMDH primarily catalysed the reductive reaction, more NADH was supposed to be converted into $\mathsf { N A D } ^ { + }$ .However, a high ratio of NADH/NAD+ was found in the transgenic plants (Figure 7a)，which can be explained，at least partly，by the following facts. First,NADH and $\mathsf { N A D } ^ { + }$ were used to generate other antioxidants and provide electron cofactors for other oxidoreductases and hence were tied to every other redox pair and large amounts of oxidoreductases (Hashida et al.，2009); second，large redox differences in the NAD(H)pools existed between cell compartments(lgamberdiev and Gardestrom, 2003);third,MdcyMDH overexpression affected the expression of genes involved in NAD $( \mathsf { H } )$ metabolism，such as quinolinate synthetaseAand dihydrolipoamidedehydrogenase (Figure3c; Ceciliani et al.，2ooo).Therefore,the sole reaction catalysed by MdcyMDH could not determine the NAD(H) level of the cell,and an enhanced NADH/NAD+ might result from the wide metabolism modification mediated by MdcyMDH overexpression.

# MdcyMDH enhances the tolerance of the transgenic plants to cold and salt by improving the cell reducing power

Abiotic stresses,such as drought,salt and low temperature,can damage cells and lead to oxidative stress by producing certain deleterious chemical entities called ROS,which include ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ $\mathsf { O } _ { 2 } ^ { - }$ hydroxylradical $( \mathsf { O H } ^ { - } )$ ,etc.Enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants can be employed to directly scavenge ROS and free radicals. In ourprevious study，MdcyMDH overexpression increased SOD and CAT activities in the transgenic apple callus and tomato plants (Yao et al.，2011b)． In this study， the significantly increased nonenzymatic antioxidants (AsA and GSH)in the transgenic plants favoured the direct scavenging of ROS (Figure 7c,d; Noctor and Foyer, 1998). In contrast, AsA/DHA, GSH/GSSH， NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ cOUples Were placed at the heart of the cell'sredox metabolism (Potters et al., 2010).Presently，the regulatory roles of cellular redox couples have predominantly come from studies using rather severe stress treatments that induced large amounts of ROS or programmed cell death (Potters et al.,201O).For example,severe salt stress caused a 10-fold decrease in the GSH/GSSH ratio in Arabidopsis (Borsani et al.，2oo1).In contrast,the redox state and responses tomild stress remain a conundrum (Potters et al.，201O).Here, mild cold and salt stresses generated increased ratios of AsA DHA,GSH/GSSG and $N \mathsf { A D } ( \mathsf { P } ) \mathsf { H } / \mathsf { N A D } ( \mathsf { P } ) ^ { + }$ (Figure 7a,e). Similarly, ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ -induced heat stress alleviation can be associated with the reduction of oxidative stress through increasing AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG ratios in tomato plants (Li et al.,2015).Therefore,it is suggested that the increased ratio of AsA/DHA,GSH/GSSG and NAD(P)H/NAD $( { \mathsf { P } } ) ^ { + }$ contributed favourably to the mild oxidative stress tolerances.

Redox compounds are primarily derived from the mitochondrial and chloroplast metabolisms (Chew et al.,20o3;Green and Fry, 2005).The modified chloroplast and mitochondrial metabolisms (Figures 5 and 6) might be one of the factors affecting the level of redox compounds in the transgenic plants.Similarly，it was reported that mMDH can alter photosynthetic,photorespiration and leaf respiration and affect ascorbate content in tomato and Arabidopsis (Nunes-Nesi etal.,2005;Tomazetal.,201O);plastid NAD-MDH can alter glutathione levels and the respiration rate in Arabidopsis (Beeler et al.，2014).Additionally，modifications in the mMDH and chMDH activities were found in the MdcyMDH transgenic plants (Figure 4b,c).Therefore，itisspeculated that MDHs from different cell compartments might cooperate to modify the chloroplastand mitochondrial metabolisms via malate valves.Moreover，another shuttle system (triose-phosphate/3- phosphoglycerate shuttle） between the chloroplast and the cytosol is suggested to be activated by MdcyMDH overexpression, based on the large expression modification of the key genes in this shuttle system，that is triose-phosphate/phosphate translocatorand glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase(Figure 3c; Guo et al.， 2012； Taniguchi and Miyake， 2012). Therefore，MdcyMDH might modify chloroplast and mitochondrial metabolisms and hence the redox state via different shuttle systems.

# MdcyMDH increases cold and salt tolerance by modifying the redox signal

The redox pairs within the cellular stress response network are more complex and do not simply act as a scavenger;redox metabolism and its associated signalling are important machinery during abiotic stress (Munné-Bosch et al.，2013). It is suggested that ascorbate and glutathione pools have precise and distinct roles in redox signalling (Munné-Bosch et al.，2o13)and participate in the signal transduction pathways (Ramel et al.，2012). Changes in the glutathione content and in the ratio of GSH/GSSG clearly modify redox-and $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ -dependent gene regulation (Han et al.,2013). In this study, the increased ratios of AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG (Figure 7e) may affect the redox signalling in the transgenic plants. On the other hand, ROS,such as ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ^ { \cdot - }$ 1 areproposed to function in signallingbetween different organelles and the nucleus; the cytosol should be considered as ahub where cross-communication between divergent ROs signals occurs (Choudhury et al.,2013). However,ROS accumulationat high levels causes oxidative stress leading to cell death (Choudhury et al.，2013). The dual function of ROS implies that its cellular concentration has to be tightly controlled (Apel and Hirt,2004). In this study,the $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ level was increased,but $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ^ { \cdot - }$ wasdecreased by MdcyMDH overexpression (Figure 7f)； this modification possibly altered the ROS signal，which was also suggested by the two largely up-regulated glyceraldehyde 3- phosphatedehydrogenase genes,related to ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ signal transduction (Figure 3c; Guo et al.,2012); the altered redox signalling might positively contribute to the increased cold and salt tolerance in the transgenic plants.

It is proposed that malate valves play an essential role in the regulation of catalase activity and the accumulation of a ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ signal by transmitting the redox state of the chloroplast to other cell compartments (Heyno et al.,2014).Therefore,the increase in ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ content in the transgenic plants may be influenced by the altered MdcyMDH-mediated regulation of malate valves.Additionally,the expression of three peroxidases was largely downregulated (Figure 3c)，suggesting a possible decrease in ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ scavenging，which led to the increase of $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ (Passardi et al., 2004).Moreover, $\mathsf { O } _ { 2 } ^ { - }$ can be rapidly converted to ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ by SOD1 or SOD2 (Murphy，2009); the decreased $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ^ { \cdot - }$ (Figure 7f）might contribute to the increase of $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ in the transgenic plants.

# The promoted interaction of redox and SA favours the tolerance of the transgenic plants to cold and salt stresses

It is known that the SA signalling pathway is pivotal for enhanced salt and oxidative stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Jayakannan et al.，2015).MdcyMDH overexpression might affect the stress tolerance of the transgenic plants via the SA signalling pathway based on the increased free and total SA (Figure 8b,c).SA is synthesized by two distinct pathways:The phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway in the cytoplasm and the isochorismate (ICS1) pathway in the chloroplast.The ICS1 pathway is now thoughtto be thepredominant pathway responsible for SA synthesis (Jayakannan et al.,2015). In the transgenic plants,an /CS1 gene,marker gene in the ICS1 pathway and two arogenate dehydratase genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine were largely transcriptionally up-regulated (Figure 3c)，implying that MdcyMDH increased SA biosynthesis by promoting the above pathways.The defectiveness in the expression of the /CS1 gene is hypersensitive to saltstress in Arabidopsis (Asensi-Fabado and Munné-Bosch,2011), and salt- and cold-induced /CS1 expression was found in apple plants (Figure S2),implying that this pathway was essential for salt and cold tolerance in plants.Noticeably, two E3 ubiquitin-protein ligaseBAH1-like genes were largely enhancedby MdcyMDH overexpression (Figure 3c),and they were largely induced by cold and salt (Figure S2);this type of gene is involved in the negative regulation of SA accumulation independent of ICS1 (Kim et al., 2010)and might be one the factors decreasing the SA level when the transgenicand WT plants were subjected to stresses (Figure 8b, c).Taken together,MdcyMDH increased the SA level by several SA metabolism pathways including synthesis and degradation,which are likely to maintain the most suitable SA level under stress.

The modification of the redox state might be an important factoraffecting the SA level. It has been found that an elevated $\mathsf { N A D } ^ { + }$ level did influence SA turnover and biosynthesis via downstream ICS1 genes (Pétriacq et al.，2012).Other antioxidants,such as ascorbate and glutathione,are also central redox regulators of the SA signalling pathway (Bartoli et al.，2013). Moreover,ROS can influence the SA metabolism,and the ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ dependent activation of SA-dependent pathways iswell characterized (Munné-Bosch et al.,2013). On the other hand, the tight correlation between SA, ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ and GSH contents was observed in plants，implying an essential role of SA in the acclimation processes and in regulating the redox homeostasis of the cell (Mateo et al.，2oo6).Taken together,the complex network of cross-communication between oxidants and antioxidants in the redox signaling hub and the different hormone signalling pathways regulates plant survival upon exposure to stress (Bartoli et al.,2013),which might be the key mechanism of MdcyMDHmediated abiotic stress tolerance.

Thus to conclude，MdcyMDH overexpression improved the tolerance of the transgenic apple plants to salt and cold conditions by the following possible mechanisms.First，the reducing power was enhanced，and the level of $\mathsf { O } _ { 2 } ^ { - }$ was decreased; second,changes in the redox couples and the level of ${ \sf H } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 2 }$ contributed favourably to stress tolerance as redox signals; third,the stress-resistant pathway mediated by SA was strengthened; finally, the widely modified gene expression in the transgenic plants implicated that redox compounds and SA participated in the chloroplast-to-nucleus and mitochondria-tonucleus retrograde communication,which served to coordinate gene expression in the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes and played an important role in the stressacclimation of plants (Cela et al.,2011;Ramel et al.,2012).

# Experimental procedures

# Plant materials and growth conditions

'Gala'apple in vitro shoot cultures were used for the gene expression assays,genetic transformation and other analyses.The 'Gala'cultures were grown on MS subculture media containing $0 . 6 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ of 6-BA and $0 . 2 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ of IAA at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ under a $1 6 - 1 7$ photoperiod with a light intensity of $6 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } } ^ { 2 } / { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ Three-yearold pot-cultured WT and transgenic apple trees were used for the salt treatment，photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence assays.

# RNA extraction and gene expression analysis with realtime quantitative PCR

Total RNAs were extracted from apple in vitro shoot cultures using TRlzol Reagent (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA),according to the manufacturer's instructions.Two micrograms of total RNAs was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA.For real-time quantitative PCR,the specific primer pairs are given in Table S1.The reactions were performed using SYBR Green MasterMix (SYBR Premix EX Taq TM,Dalian,China),as described by the manufacturer.Realtime quantitative PCRs were performed using a BlO-RAD iQ5 (Hercules,CA) instrument.The expression values obtained were normalized against 18s rRNA by the cycle threshold (Ct) $2 ^ { - \Delta \Delta C _ { \mathrm { t } } }$ method (Software IQ5 2.O) (Bio-Rad,Hercules,CA).

# Agrobacterium-mediated genetictransformation of MdcyMDH into apple in vitro shoot cultures

The MdcyMDH ORF Was obtained by PCR using the forward primer $5 ^ { \prime }$ -GGTCTAGAATGGCGAAAGAACCAGTTC- ${ \cdot } 3 ^ { \prime }$ and the reverseprimer $5 ^ { \prime }$ -CGTCGACAGTCGAAGTGTCCGAATAGAAT$3 ^ { \prime }$ .The forward primer contained a Xba 丨 digestion site,and the reverse primer contained a $S a  { h }$ site (both underlined).Subsequently, the PCR product was cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa，Dalian，China).MdcyMDH was double-digested with Xbal and Sal，and then ligated into the pBl121 vector, downstream of the CaMV35S promoter.The resultant constructs were introduced into the Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 and transformed into apple leaves from in vitro shoot cultures，as described by our previous study (Feng et al.，2012).The specific primers from35s( $5 ^ { \prime }$ -GACGCACAATCCCACTATCC-3') and MdcyMDH $5 ^ { \prime }$ -GGATCCAGAGAGGCAAGAGTA-3') were used in PCR to determine whether MdcyMDH was integrated into the apple plants.A plasmid DNA containing the pBl121:MdcyMDH construct and $H _ { 2 } O$ was used as positive and negative controls.

# Enzyme extraction and isolation of mitochondria and chloroplast

Cytosolicenzyme extractions were performed according to our previous study (Yao et al.，2011b).Mitochondria and chloroplast were isolated mechanically from 15 and $\boldsymbol { { 1 0 \ 9 } }$ of leaves ofapple in vitro shoot cultures,respectively，and then purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described by Osmond and Makino (1991).Mitochondrial integrity Was detected by measuring the cytochrome C oxidase activity with and without $0 . 0 5 \%$ Triton $x -$ 100.In the tested samples,the membrane integrity exceeded $8 6 \%$ .The intactness of the purified chloroplast fraction was over $84 \%$ as judged by the ferricyanide test.The purities of the cytosolic,mitochondria and chloroplast fractions were verified by measuring the activities of maker enzymes located in other organelles (Table S2). Protein amounts were quantified using dyebinding assay with bovine serum albumin (Bradford,1976).

# MDH activity assays and malate-dependent respiratory rates

MDH reductive activity was measured in 1 mL of a reaction mixture containing $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)，2 mM $\mathsf { M g C l } _ { 2 }$ $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ EDTA, $0 . 2 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ NADH, $2 ~ { \mathsf { m m } }$ OAA and $5 0 ~ \mu \ L$ of extract at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ ：The reaction was initiated by adding OAA.MDH oxidative activity was measured in $1 \ m L$ of a reaction mixture containing $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ Tris-HCl $\left( \mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 8 . 9 \right)$ ,2mM $\mathsf { M g C l } _ { 2 }$ $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ EDTA, $0 . 2 \mathrm { \ m u } \mathrm { \ N A D ^ { + } }$ and $2 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ malate.The reaction was initiated by adding malate.For each reaction，5 min of spectrophotometric changeat $3 4 0 \ \mathsf { n m }$ was monitored automaticallyat 4O-s intervals, and the activities were calculated according to the slopes of the obtained lines.The assay conditions were not optimized with respect to the concentration of each component of the reaction mixture.However, linear relationships between the activityand time and amount of the extract were found.

Malate-dependent respiratory rates on isolated intact mitochondria were performed according to the method of Tomaz et al. (2010).

# Determination of malate content

Malate content was determined using a capillary electrophoresis system (Beckman P/ACE，Palo Alto，CA)as described in our previous study (Yao et al.,2007).

# Measurement of photosynthesis and chlorophyll content

Photosynthesis was measured using a portable photosynthesis system (CIRAS-2;PPS Co. Ltd.,Hitchin,UK).Photosynthesis was measured three times for each selected leaf，so that nine measurements were made for each plant.Measurements were made between 8:30 and $1 1 { : } 0 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ on a sunny day. During each measurement, ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ concentrationwasmaintainedat $3 9 6 \pm 2 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { U L }$ by the CIRAS system at an air temperature of approximately $2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ and a relative humidity of $8 5 \pm 0 . 9 \%$ Chlorophyll content was determined according to the methods described by Zhu et al. (1990).

# Measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence

Chlorophyll fluorescence Was measured with a FMS-2 pulsemodulated fluorometer (Hansatech，Norfolk，UK).The lightfluorescence measurement protocol was as follows:The lightadapted leaves were continuously illuminated by actinic light at $1 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { s }$ from the FMS-2 light source; steady-state fluorescence $( F _ { 5 } )$ was recorded after 2 min of illumination;and $0 . 8 \mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ of saturating light of $8 0 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \varsigma$ was imposed to obtain a maximum fluorescence in the light-adapted state $( F _ { \mathsf { m } } )$ .The actinic light was then turned off,and the minimum fluorescence in the light-adapted state $( F _ { 0 } )$ was determined by 3s of illumination with far-red light.The following parameters were then calculated as follows (Maxwell and Johnson,2000):

Quantum yield of PSIl, $\Phi \mathsf { P S l l } = ( F _ { \mathsf { m } } - F _ { \mathsf { s } } ) / F _ { \mathsf { m } }$

Electron transport rate $\mathsf { E T R } = \Phi \mathsf { P S } | | \times \mathsf { P F D } \times 0 . 5 \times 0 . 8 4$ $\mathsf { P F D } = 1 0 0 0$

Maximum quantum yield of PSIl, $F _ { \mathrm { v } } / F _ { \mathrm { m } } = 1 - ( F _ { 0 } / F _ { \mathrm { m } } )$

# Extractions and assays of redox couples and ROs

Extractionsand determinations of the four redox couples,that is NADH/NAD+，NADPH/NADP+，reduced ascorbate (AsA)/oxidized ascorbate (DHA)and reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG),were performed as described by Queval and Noctor (2007). Hydrogen peroxide $( \mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 2 } )$ and superoxide radical $( \mathsf { O } _ { 2 } ^ { - } )$ were extracted and measured according to the methods described by Zhu et al. (1990).

# Hormone extraction and determination

Lyophilized leave $_ { ( 0 . 5 \ { \mathfrak { g } } ) }$ was ground into a powder.The powdered samples were extracted three times in $5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of cold $80 \%$ methanol (v/v) mixed with $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ of sodium diethyldithio carbamate.The extracts were centrifuged at $8 0 0 0 \ { \mathfrak { g } }$ and $4 ^ { \circ } C$ for 10 min.The supernatant was concentrated to dryness under vacuum.The residue was dissolved in $4 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of $0 . 4 ~ \mathsf { M }$ phosphate buffer $\left( \mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 8 . 0 \right)$ .The solution was mixed with $4 ~ \mathsf { m L }$ of trichloromethane to remove the pigment.After centrifuging at $8 0 0 0 \ { \mathfrak { g } }$ and $4 ^ { \circ } C$ for $1 0 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ ，the aqueous phase was collected and supplemented with polyvinylpyrrolidone to remove the phenolics, and then centrifuged at $8 0 0 0 \ g$ and $4 ^ { \circ } C$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ The supernatant was extracted with $4 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of ethyl acetate $\left( \mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } \ 3 . 0 \right)$ twice.The upper phase was collected and concentrated to dryness under vacuum.The residue was dissolved in $1 \ m L$ of $0 . 5 \%$ (v/v) acetic acid/methanol $( 5 5 : 4 5$ ，v/v)and finally filtered through a $0 . 4 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ filter.The obtained solution was used to determine ABA, GA3,IAA and SA. Extractions of free and conjugated SA were performedasdescribedby Fragniere etal. (2011).

The extracted hormones were quantified using a LC-ESl-MS (Thermo,San Jose,CA) instrument.Ten microlitres of the sample was injected into a Thermo Scientific Hypersil Gold column （20 $( 5 0 \times 2 . 1 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ 1 $1 . 9 \ \mu \mathrm { m } )$ in the Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo,San Jose,CA).The HPLC solvents Were as follows: A, $0 . 0 4 \%$ acetate acid in water and B,methanol $( 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m U }$ min).The two mobile phases were used in the gradient mode under the following time/concentration $( \mathrm { m i n } / \% )$ of B:0.0/20,0.5/ 20,2.5/90,3.5/90,3.6/20 and 5.0/20.Detection and quantification were performed using the TSQ Quantum Access MAX system (Thermo).SA was detected in the ESl negative mode and selected reaction monitoring with the following parameters:parent mass by charge $( m / z )$ of263.1,daughtermass by charge $( m / z )$ of 153.0 and collision energy of $1 4 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ .The parameters for the ion source were set as follows: ion spray voltage of $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { V } ,$ temperature of $3 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ ：collision gas pressure of 1.5 mTorr，sheath gas of 25arbitrary units and auxiliary gas of15arbitrary units.The amount of free and conjugated SA was calculated in mg/g DW with reference to the amount of internal standard (ortho-anisic acid).

# Sequence-based DGE

Sample preparation and sequencing were performed with the Illumina Gene Expression Sample Prep kit and Solexa Sequencing

Chip (flowcell according to the manufacturer's introductions on the llumina Cluster Station and Illumina HiSeqTM 2Ooo system (lllumina Inc.，San Diego，CA).The sequencing lengths of raw reads were 49 bp in each line of the flowcell tunnel.The raw sequences were transformed into 17 bp clean tags，and tag counting was carried out using the Illumina Pipeline.

All tags were annotated using the apple genome database (http://genomics.research.iasma.it/).Briefly,a preprocessed database containing all possible CATG $^ +$ 17-base tag sequences was created.All clean tags were mapped to the reference sequence, and only1 bp mismatch was considered.Clean tags mapped to the reference sequences from multiple genes were filtered.The remainder clean tags were designed as unambiguous clean tags. The number of unambiguous clean tags for each gene was calculated,and then normalized to TPM (number of transcripts per million clean tags).

Finally,a rigorous algorithm developed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGl） referring to ‘the significance of digital gene expression profiles' (falsediscoveryrate $< 0 . 0 0 1$ ） (Audic and Claverie,1997)was used to identify differentially expressed genes between two samples，and absolute value of $\mathsf { l o g } _ { 2 } \mathsf { r a t i o \ \geq } 1$ (minimum of twofold difference) was used as the threshold to judge the significance of gene expression differences.
