ABSTRACT: Herein, a nontoxic nanocomposite is synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate in the presence of a cationic polymer displaying strong antimicrobial activity against bacterial infection. These nanocomposites with a large concentration of positive charge promote their adsorption to bacterial membranes through electrostatic interaction. Moreover， the synthesized nanocomposites with polyvalent and synergistic antimicrobial effects can effectively kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without the emergence of bacterial resistance. Morphological changes obtained by transmission electron microscope observation show that these nanocomposites can cause leakage and chaos of intracellular contents. Analysis of the antimicrobial mechanism confirms that the lethal action of nanocomposites against the bacteria started with disruption of the bacterial membrane, subsequent cellular internalization of the nanoparticles， and hhibitionof intracellar enzymatic activity.This novel antimicrobial material with good cytocompatibilitypromotes healing of nfected wounds in diabetic rats, and has a promising future in the treatment of other infectious diseases.

# INTRODUCTION

Infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a significant threat to human health worldwide.In the United States alone, more than 2 million people with antibiotic-resistant infections arereported every year,withat least 23 Ooo deaths asa result.' These bacteria are extremely resistant to conventional antibiotics owing to acquired resistance， limited diffusion，and intracellular inactivation.Therefore,the development of new antimicrobial materials with high safety and antibacterial activity and without bacterial resistance is crucial.

Cationic polymers that possess a high number of positive charges and membrane-disrupting activity toward negatively charged microbial surface phospholipids show potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria，fungi，and viruses.² To acquire permanent antibacterial properties， most cationic polymers are immobilized onto the substrate surface or made into hydrogels.34 However, their antimicrobial activities may be obviously reduced because penetration of the cell membranes into the cytoplasm is limited during immobilization. Nanomaterials，which are capable of diffusing into the bacterial membrane and disrupting its integrity， provide a new opportunity for the antimicrobial application of cationic polymers. Silver nanoparticles $\left( \mathrm { { A g N P s } } \right)$ ，one of the predominant nanomaterials，display broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal species，including antibiotic-resistant strains.AgNPs are used for the treatment of burns and marketed as a water disinfectant and room spray. Combination of AgNPs with cationic polymers facilitates constant stability of dispersed AgNPs in aqueous solution. This nanocomposite easily forms core-shell structured nanoparticles with an AgNP core and cationic polymer shell with the alkyl tail arranged toward the surrounding environment. The formation of nanoparticles is expected to increase the local density of the positive charge and promote its adsorption to negatively charged bacterial membranes through electrostatic interactions, thereby enhancing antimicrobial property and diffusivity into the bacterial membrane.In addition，this nanoparticle with two biologically active fragments，combined with the goal of merging different modes of action synergistically, is optimal for wound healing.Notably, the convergence of two antimicrobial materials into a single one does not appear to induce bacterial resistance.

Herein,we synthesized a new antibacterial nanoparticle with a tertiary amino group containing the monomer 2- (dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA)，which was directly polymerized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer(RAFT) polymerization.The PDMAEMA chains were quaternized with alkyl bromide in the tertiary amino groups (PDMAEMA $\scriptstyle \cdot C _ { n } ,$ （20 $n = 2$ , 4,8,12,and 16,and similarly hereafter）and subsequently used as templates to prepare cationic polymer PDMAEMA- $C _ { n }$ -stabilized AgNPs $ { \langle \mathrm { A g N P s } \mathcal { Q } }$ PDMAEMA- $\mathbf { C } _ { n , \astrosun } ^ { \phantom { \dagger } }$ ).Toachieve desired antimicrobial activity and cytocompatibility, the synthesis conditions (e.g.，different alkyl chains,molarratio ofPDMAEMA- $\mathbf { C } _ { n }$ and silver, the volume of reducing agent,and the molecular weight of PDMAEMA- $\mathbf { C } _ { n } .$ ） of $\mathrm { A g N P s } @ \mathrm { P D M A E M A - C } _ { n }$ were optimized comprehensively. Moreover, the synthesis,characterization,antibacterial activity, antibacterial mechanism，and biocompatibility of $\mathbf { A g N P s } ( \mathcal { O }$ PDMAEMA- $\mathbf { C } _ { n }$ were systematically studied.Finally,we further explored the effects of new antimicrobial materials on the treatment of bacteria-induced wound infection in healthy and diabetic rats.

# EXPERIMENTALDETAILS

Preparation of AgNPs@PDMAEMA $\cdot \mathsf { C } _ { 4 }$ . Typically, $1 0 2 \mu \mathrm { L }$ of10 $\mathrm { m g / m L }$ $( 5 8 . 8 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ 1 ${ \tt A g N O } _ { 3 }$ and $2 1 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ (28.0 $\mathrm { { m m o l / L } }$ ）PDMAEMA $C _ { 4 }$ (molar ratio 1:1) were mixed with $4 . 5 3 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of methanol under vigorous stirring in an ice-water bath.Then,150 $\mu \mathrm { L }$ of $1 1 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ 一 $( \bar { 3 } 1 2 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L } )$ fleshly $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ was rapidly added, and the solution was stirred continuously for $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The solution turned from faint yellow to reddish-brown. The methanol was removed under reduced pressure at $5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ and $5 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of ultrapure water was added into the residue.The concentration of $\mathbf { A g N P s } \textcircled { \alpha }$ PDMAEMA- $C _ { 4 }$ was $1 2 9 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ (Ag mass concentration).

Fluorescence Polarization Measurement. The fast-growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus ( $5 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { \breve { 7 } }$ CFU/ mL)were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of PBS. The bacteria were treated with $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ of a series of concentration for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ Then $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m L }$ of $1 . 0 ~ \times ~ 1 0 ^ { - 5 } ~ \mathrm { \ m o l / L }$ fluorescent membrane probe,1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH, Molecular Probes,Aladdin),was added to each treated bacteria and incubated in the dark for $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ to allow the probe incorporation into the cytoplasmic membrane.Finally,the bacterial cells were rinsed with PBS and resuspended in $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m L }$ of PBS for the fluorescence measurements.

The steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed with a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer using $1 \ \mathrm { c m }$ path length quartz cuvettes.Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 360 and $4 4 2 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，respectively.Polarizers were set in eithera vertical or horizontal position.The slit widths for the excitation and emission beams were both $5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ .Background intensities of samples were subtracted from each sample spectrum to cancel out any contribution due to the solvent Raman peak and other scattering artifacts. Fluorescence polarization measurement was performed using a Shimadzu polarization accessory. Polarization values were calculated from the following equation:7

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { \mathrm { p o l a r i z a t i o n v a l u e s } = \displaystyle \frac { I _ { \mathrm { V V } } - G I _ { \mathrm { V H } } } { I _ { \mathrm { V V } } + G I _ { \mathrm { V H } } } } } \\ { { G = \displaystyle \frac { I _ { \mathrm { H V } } } { I _ { \mathrm { H H } } } } } \end{array}
$$

where $\boldsymbol { I _ { \mathrm { W } } }$ was the fluorescence intensity with vertical excitation and vertical emission, $I _ { \mathrm { V H } }$ was the fluorescence intensity with vertical excitation and horizontal emission, $I _ { \mathrm { H V } }$ was the fluorescence intensity with horizontal excitation and vertical emission，and $I _ { \mathrm { H H } }$ was the fluorescence intensity with horizontal excitation and horizontal emission. The correlation factor $G$ was defined as the ratio of $I _ { \mathrm { H V } }$ to $I _ { \mathrm { H H } }$

Inhibition of Enzyme $\beta$ -galactosidase Activity.The Escherichia coli suspension ${ ( 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m L } , }$ about $5 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { \ C F U / m L }$ ）was harvested by centrifuging $\left( 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m } \right)$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $ { 5 }  { \mathrm { m i n } }$ and washing with PBS three times.The supernatant was discarded,and the remaining bacteria were resuspended in $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of PBS.The solution containing the cytoplasm was extracted from the bacteria byultrasound for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ in an ice-water bath and filtrated through a $0 . 2 2 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ cellulose membrane.Then,0.5 $\mathrm { m L }$ ofAgNPs@PDMAEMA- $C _ { 4 }$ (0.6,1.5,and $3 . 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ ,AgNPs (0.6 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ suspensions,and ultrapure water were added to $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of the filtrate.After incubation for $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n } ;$ ， $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { m L }$ of $1 0 \mathrm { \ m g / m L }$ orthonitrophenyl- $\beta$ -D-galactopyranoside(ONPG）wasadded. The generated ortho-nitrophenol (ONP）was determined by monitoring the optical density at $4 2 0 \ \mathrm { n m } \ \mathrm { ( O D } _ { 4 2 0 } \mathrm { ) }$ using UV-vis spectroscopy. The control assay was carried out by the addition of ultrapure water. The percentage of $\beta$ -galactosidase inhibition was calculated as follows:

$$
\% \mathrm { \diamondsuit \ i n h i b i t i o n = \frac { \mathrm { { O D } _ { 4 2 0 } ( c o n t r o l ) - \mathrm { { O D } _ { 4 2 0 } ( s a m p l e ) } } } { \mathrm { { O D } _ { 4 2 0 } ( c o n t r o l ) } } \times 1 0 0 \% }
$$

Preparation of Ultrathin Sections of Bacterial Samples for TEM.The bacterial suspensions $( 1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \mathrm { C F U / m L } )$ of $P .$ aeruginosa and S.aureus were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of PBS.The samples were subsequently incubated for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $3 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ solution.Free $\mathrm { A g N P s @ P D M A E M A - ( }$ $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ was removed by centrifuging $\left( 5 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m } \right)$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ and washing with PBS three times.The remaining bacteria were fixed with $1 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $2 . 5 \%$ glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer $\left( 0 . 1 \mathrm { \ m o l / L } , \mathrm { p H } 7 . 4 \right)$ for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ .The treated bacterial samples were washed twice with PBS and further fixed with $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $1 . 5 \%$ osmic acid for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 2 h }$ ，The obtained residues were washed thrice with PBS, dehydrated using graded ethanol solutions (30,50,70,90,95,and $1 0 0 \% , \mathrm { v / v }$ in water)and $5 0 \%$ acetone $\left( \mathbf { v } / \mathbf { v } , \right.$ in ethanol) for $1 5 \mathrm { m i n } .$ ,and finally dehydrated twice with pure acetone for $1 5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ .Then，the dehydrated samples were embedded in graded QUETOL 651 resin solutions (1:3,1:1,and $3 { : } 1 \ \mathrm { v } / \mathrm { v }$ in acetone） and pure resin containing DMP-30 overnight and polymerized at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 { \mathrm { ~ h } } .$ Subsequently, ultrathin sections of about $6 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ were cut with a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome and placed on a carbon-coated copper grid.The slices were stained with $2 \%$ uranyl acetate and $0 . 2 \%$ lead citrate before observation.Digital images were acquired using a TEM with an OSIS MEGAVIEW G2 CCD Digital Camera system.

Induction of Bacterial Resistance.An overnight culture of P. aeruginosa and S.aureus was inoculated into the Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 1/2 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC）of AgNPs@PDMAEMA ${ \bf \cdot C _ { 4 } }$ orlevofloxacin，respectively.The _bacteria were incubated at $3 7 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until a concentration of $2 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ colony forming units per milliliter $\mathrm { ( C F U / m L ) }$ was reached.These bacterial cells were inoculated on agar plates containing the nanoparticles or levofloxacin,and susceptibility to the nanoparticles or levofloxacin was examined by MIC assay.To obtain resistant variants,we passaged the cultures 30 times in the presence of increasing concentrations of the nanoparticles or levofloxacin based on the growth conditions of the variants,and the MIC was determined after each passage.

In Vivo Studies.The studies were prepared by following our previously published article.Different from the previous procedure, four wounds were made on the left and right side of the backbone of each rat.A diagrammatic sketch of the four wounds with different treatments can be seen in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).The detailed experimental description has already been provided in Supporting Information.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Synthesis of AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\cdot \mathbf { C } _ { n } .$ In this work, we synthesized a multivalent antimicrobial nanoparticle by facile reduction of $\mathrm { A g N O } _ { 3 }$ with $\mathrm { { N a B H _ { 4 } } }$ in the presence of a cationic polymer (PDMAEMA- $\mathbf { C } _ { n }$ ） via the“grafting to”approach (Figure 1).The cationic polymer was prepared by RAFT polymerization of DMAEMA，in which thiocarbonylthio compounds act as chain transfer agents to bear dithioester end groups. The PDMAEMA chains were quaternized with alkyl bromide in the tertiary amino groups and subsequently used as templates to prepare cationic polymer-functionalized AgNPs.Upon the addition of $\mathrm { A g N O } _ { 3 }$ to the PDMAEMA- $\mathbf { C } _ { n }$ solution，silver ions were easily adsorbed into the core of polymer micelles via complexation reaction with dithioester groups. The simultaneous reduction of dithioester end groups to thiols in the presence of silver ions led to the generation of $\mathrm { A g N P s } @ \mathrm { P D M A E M A - C } _ { n }$

Optimization of Synthesis Conditions of $\mathsf { \pmb { A 9 } N P s @ }$ PDMAEMA- $\cdot \mathsf { c } _ { n } .$ ，The membrane-disrupting activity of cationic polymers is reported to be mainly dependent on the length of the alkyl tail,which also influences the balance between the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of these polymers.9 Therefore，PDMAEMA quaternization with different alkyl bromide would affect antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles.To assess their effects，PDMAEMA was quaternized with 1-bromoethane $\left( \mathbf { C } _ { 2 } \right)$ ,1-bromobutane $\left( \mathrm { C } _ { 4 } \right)$ ，1- bromooctane $\left( \mathbf { C } _ { 8 } \right)$ ，1-bromododecane $\left( \mathbf { C } _ { 1 2 } \right)$ ，and1-bromohexadecane $\left( \mathbf { C } _ { 1 6 } \right)$ ,respectively,and then reacted with silver ions to form the nanoparticles. The quaternization degree of PDMAEMA was 82.2,81.3, 80.3, 67.5,and 55.3, respectively. The MIC assay confirmed that the antibacterial activity against P.aeruginosa and S.aureus was greater when the PDMAEMA was quaternized with $\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } , \mathrm { C } _ { 4 } ,$ and ${ \mathrm { C } } _ { 8 }$ rather than with $\mathbf { C } _ { 1 2 }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 6 }$ (Figure 2A).It was possibly because a longer alkyl chain induced a greater hydrophobicity，leading to the decrease of antibacterialactivity.The cell viabilityof the nanoparticleswith different alkyl chains and different concentrations (1.O and 2.0 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L } )$ ）were used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect against NIH3T3 cell (Figure 2B,C).The cell viability ofPDMAEMA quaternization with $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ was clearly higher than that of the PDMAEMA quaternized with a longer alkyl chain and maintained over $80 \%$ ．Taken together，the optimal alkyl bromide was $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$

To investigate the effect of molar ratio ofPDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ to silver on antibacterial activity，AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ with different molar ratios (total molar maintained constant) were synthesized and characterized with UV-vis spectrum, size,and Zeta potential (Figure 2D,E).As the molar ratio of PDMAEMA- ${ \bf \cdot C _ { 4 } }$ to silver increased，the UV-vis absorption intensity decreased, the plasmon absorption red-shifted, the size decreased,and the Zeta potential increased.MIC value against P.aeruginosa and S.aureus was determined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the nanoparticles with different molar ratios,and the results are shown in Figure 2F.The higher ratio of PDMAEMA $C _ { 4 }$ was able to offer a lower MIC value. However, further increaseof the ratio ofPDMAEMA $C _ { 4 }$ would cause a high MIC value.Generally, the nanoparticles with lower MIC values are considered more effective antimicrobial materials.Therefore,a 1:1 molar ratio of PDMAEMA- ${ \bf \cdot C _ { 4 } }$ to silver was employed.

Toexamine the effect of $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ volume on antibacterial activity,we synthesized the nanoparticles with $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ volume from 50 to $3 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ and characterized them by UV-vis spectrum，size，and Zeta potential (Figure $^ { 2 \mathrm { G } , \mathrm { H } } ,$ ).Withthe increase of $\mathrm { { N a B H _ { 4 } } }$ volume，the UV-vis absorption intensity increased, the absorption spectra blue-shifted,and the size and Zeta potential decreased. The antibacterial activity of the nanoparticles with different $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ volumes was studied by MIC value against $P .$ ，aeruginosa and S. aureus.As shown in Figure 2I,MIC value decreased with increasing $\mathrm { N a B H } _ { 4 }$ volume and reached a minimum of $1 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ .Therefore，150 μLof $\mathrm { { N a B H _ { 4 } } }$ was chosen.

The effect of molecular weight of PDMAEMA $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ on antibacterial activity was also studied. The nanoparticles with different molecular weights of PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ were synthesized and characterized with UV-vis spectra and gel permeation chromatography (GPC; Figure 2J,K and Table S1, Supporting Information). The GPC traces of homogeneous polymer PDMAEMA were monomodal and had a reasonably narrow molecular weight distribution (polydispersity index (PDI) $\angle$ 1.25).The quaternization degree of PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ with different molecular weights was in the range of $7 2 . 2 \mathrm { - } 8 1 . 3 \%$ Moreover， the UV-vis absorption intensity decreased as the molecular weight increased.The antibacterial activity of the nanoparticles with PDMAEMA $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ of different molecular weights was estimated by MIC value against P.aeruginosa and S. aureus,respectively. The results showed that the MIC value increased with increasing molecular weight (Figure 2L). Therefore,the molecular weight of 8427 Da was selected.

Characterization of AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\cdot \mathsf { C } _ { 4 }$ .The formation of AgNPs@PDMAEMA ${ \bf \cdot C _ { 4 } }$ was observed under TEM. There are differences between the TEM images of AgNPs and AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ (Figure $^ { 3 \mathrm { A , B } }$ ).When compared with $\mathrm { \bf A g N P s } ,$ the appearance of the polymer corona has been formed around the nanoparticles.From a pictorial representation (Figure 3C),it is clear that the color of nanoparticle solution changed from yellow to reddish-brown as the PDMAEMA-C was fixed on AgNPs，indicating the formation of $\mathbf { A g N P s } \ @$ PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ ，UV-vis absorption spectra of AgNPs and AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ are shown in Figure 3D.The maximum absorption of nanoparticles showed a red shift from 396 to $4 4 4 \ \mathrm { n m }$ when compared with that of $ { \mathrm { A g N P s } }$ Moreover，low peak intensity and increased peak width appeared when compared with those of the uncapped AgNPs.These results were possibly caused by a loss of the surface plasmon resonance absorbance of $\mathbf { A g N P s }$ ：

Antibacterial Activity of $\mathsf { A g N P s @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ .The antibacterial activity of $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ was evaluated by growth inhibition of $P .$ ，aeruginosa and S.aureus in the presence of the nanoparticle with different concentrations and determination their the optical density at $6 0 0 \mathrm { n m } \left( \mathrm { O D } _ { 6 0 0 } \right)$ after $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，As shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information)，the growth of $P .$ 、aeruginosa and S.aureus was inhibited,while the concentration of nanoparticles was more than O.4 and $0 . 2 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \$ ${ \mathrm { m L } } ,$ respectively. The cationic polymers (e.g., PDMAEMA- $C _ { 4 }$ ） do not have a specific target toward the bacteria，and they interact with bacterial membranes based on electrostatic interaction.We believe that the high local density of positive charges on the nanoparticles leads to stronger electrostatic interaction with the bacterial membranes and subsequently efficiently kills the bacteria.

To confirm the polyvalent and synergistic effects between $ { \mathrm { A g N P s } }$ and PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 } ,$ we tested the zone of inhibition. For this purpose, $1 2 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ PDMAEMA $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ 0 $2 1 4 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ PDMAEMA ${ \bf \cdot C _ { 4 } }$ diluted in $5 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ) $1 2 9 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ $\mathrm { A u N P s } @ \mathrm { P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ (PDMAEMA $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ -stabilized gold nanoparticles using the same synthetic method as $\mathbf { A g N P s } \textcircled { a }$ PDMAEMA $\cdot \mathrm { C } _ { 4 , }$ ), $1 2 9 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ AgNPs (about $5 . 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ in size), and $1 2 9 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L \ A g N P s } _ { @ } \mathrm { P D M A E M A - C } _ { 4 }$ were prepared.As shown in Figure 4, the diameters of the zones of inhibition of $\mathrm { A u N P s } @ \mathrm { P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ were larger than those of PDMAE$\mathrm { M A } { \cdot } \mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ .In general, larger diameters of the bacteria-free zone surrounding the disk signify that bacteria are more sensitive to the antimicrobial materials contained in the disk.Due to weak antibacterial activity，AuNPs are often used as molecular scaffolds for obtaining bound molecules in multiple copies, which may facilitate the polyvalent effects of polymers.10 Moreover, the diameters of the zones of inhibition of $\operatorname { A g N P s } ( \mathcal { O }$ PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ were significantly larger than those of PDMAEMA- $C _ { 4 }$ and $\mathbf { A g N P }$ alone，which issuggestive of excellent synergistic activity between AgNPs and PDMAE$\mathrm { M A } { \cdot } \mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ . Clearly,AgNPs@PDMAEMA $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ exerts polyvalent and synergistic antibacterial effects,leading to superior antibacterial performance against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

The LIVE/DEAD bacterial cell viability assay was used to further confirm the antibacterial activity of AgNPs@PDMAE$\mathrm { M A } { \cdot } \mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ .Under the fluorescence microscope，the living/dead bacterial cells appeared as green/red points with intact/ damaged cell membranes. Fluorescence micrographs of $P .$ （204号 aeruginosa and S. aureus before and after treatment with AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ for O and $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ are shown in Figure

5. The untreated bacterial cells exhibited green fluorescence, indicating that they were alive (Figure SA,C).After treatment with $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ,the red fluorescence was observed, suggesting that the bacteria were dead (Figure SB,D).Therefore,the result confirmed that the nanoparticles can rapidly and efficiently kill the bacteria.

Antibacterial Mechanism of $\mathsf { A g N P s @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ To assess the mechanism underlying the antibacterial action of AgNPs@PDMAEMA $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 } ,$ we performed fluorescence polarization of DPH，which offers a means of quantitatively measuring the relative changes in fluidity of the bacterial

Cytoplasmic membrane under different growth conditions.11 The DPH fluorescent probe is hydrophobic and easily associates with lipophilic tails of phospholipids in the cytoplasmic membrane without disrupting their structure.12 Membrane polarization values were estimated as the averages of total cells,whereby a small change reflects significant alterations in the membrane structure.A high polarization value indicates low membrane fluidity.1’ Polarization values as a function of concentration alterations of nanoparticles are shown in Figure 6.Bacterial cells grown in the absence of nanoparticles exhibited lower values than those grown in the presence of nanoparticles.Moreover，polarization values increased with increasing nanoparticle concentrations in both P.aeruginosa and S.aureus.Positively charged nanoparticles can bind to the negatively charged cell surface of bacteria via electrostatic interactions.The alkyl chain of external PDMAEMA ${ \bf \cdot C _ { 4 } }$ of nanoparticles provides a lipophilic segment compatible with the lipid bilayer of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.14 This nanoparticle hinders bacterial modulation of membrane composition to maintain fluidity for cell growth and division, leading to a decrease in fluidity and disruption of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.15 Eventually， nanoparticles penetrate through the bacterial membrane to further affect intracellular function. Therefore， the obvious changes in polarization following a concentration shift of nanoparticles correspond closely with the concentration-dependent alterations in growth inhibition of bacterial cells， suggesting that decrease in membrane fluidity is one of the main causes of bacterial death.

Following the disruption of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ can penetrate the cytoplasm.To investigate whether the nanoparticles disrupt the activity of vital intracellular substances, $\beta \mathrm { . }$ galactosidase present in the cytoplasm of $E _ {  }$ ，coli was used as the research object model. $\beta$ -Galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ONPG to release ONP, measured at $\mathrm { O D } _ { 4 2 0 }$ using UV-vis spectroscopy.16 However，if $\beta$ -galactosidase activity is inhibited by nanoparticles,ONP generation is decreased.In the present study, 34.2, 41.5, and $5 0 . 7 \%$ inhibition of $\beta$ -galactosidase activity was observed with 0.6,1.5,and $3 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ AgNPs@PDMAEMA$\mathrm { C } _ { 4 } ,$ respectively.Meanwhile,inhibition by $0 . 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ AgNPs was $5 5 . 6 \%$ .Clearly，activity was decreased with increasing concentrations of $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ ，Moreover，inhibition by $\mathbf { A g N P s }$ was stronger than that by $\mathbf { A g N P s } \textcircled { \alpha }$ PDMAEMA $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ at the same concentrations， suggesting that $\mathbf { A g N P }$ within the nanocomposite plays a major role in the inhibition of $\beta$ galactosidase activity，rather than surface PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ ，With regard to the mechanism underlying the inhibition of enzymatic and protein activity,it is possible that AgNPs interact strongly with the thiol groups of intracellular enzymes and proteins, leading to degeneration.17

Generally, the enzymatic and protein activities were the close relation to their physiological functions.18 Therefore, it can be concluded that AgNPs@PDMAEMA ${ \bf \cdot C _ { 4 } }$ could affect the physiological functions of intracellular enzymes and proteins, leading to inhibition of activity and cellular damage.

To further clarify the essential antibacterial mechanism of the action of nanoparticles,we investigated ultrastructural damage of S.aureus and P.aeruginosa before and after incubation with nanoparticles through examination of TEM images of ultrathin sections.Untreated bacteria exhibited a smooth surface and distinct nucleoid structures (Figure $^ { \mathrm { 7 A , D } } ,$ ).In contrast，the bacterial cell surface became rough after incubation with nanoparticles at a concentration of $2 . 0 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ for $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ Moreover，numerous blebs formed with cytoplasmic release (Figure 7B,E).Bleb formation on the bacterial surface has been observed when bacteria are treated with cationic polymers, peptides，andantibiotics.19-21Thepenetrationof positively charged nanoparticles into negatively charged bacterial cytomembranes via electrostatic interactions accelerates cell division,leading to the formationof blebs.Inaddition,the alkyl chain of the nanoparticle surface can decrease membrane fluidity and disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane. These two factors act together to damage the bacterial cytomembrane, resulting in leakage of intracellular content.As shown in Figure 7C,F，floccules were observed within bacteria， leading to intracellular chaos.It is possible that the nanoparticles react with the intracellular enzymes,and proteins and inhibit their activity.Therefore,positively charged nanoparticles increase the permeability of the cytoplasmic bacterial membrane due to the presence of external PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ ，Subsequently，these nanoparticles penetrate the cells and strongly associate with intracellular enzymes and proteins,resulting in cell death.

Bacterial Resistance by AgNPs@PDMAEMA- $\cdot \mathsf { C } _ { 4 }$ To investigate potential bacterial resistance against $\mathbf { A g N P s } \ @$ PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 } ,$ we induced nanoparticle and levofloxacin resistance in cultures of $P .$ 、aeruginosa and S.aureus, respectively. After 30 passages,the MIC value of nanoparticles against $P$ aeruginosa and S.aureus remained constant compared to the original value， indicating no emerging bacterial resistance. However, the MIC of levofloxacin increased from 3.2 to 156 $\mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ against P. aeruginosa and from 0.64 to $7 8 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ against S. aureus during the 30 passages，illustrating emergence of bacterial resistance to the drug. We conclude that synthetic $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ with a double mechanism of antibacterial action，as well as disruption of membrane structure and inhibition of enzymatic activity，is able to efficiently suppress the emergence of bacterial resistance.Moreover, convergence of multiple antimicrobial components in a single material does not induce bacterial resistance.22

Cell Viability.The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles against NIH3T3 cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. The cell viability of nanoparticles as a function of concentration (from 0.5 to $8 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ,$ ）and incubation time is presented in Figure S8(Supporting Information).Cell viability of nanoparticles was over $8 0 \%$ at concentrations $\leq 8 . 0 \ \mu \mathrm { g / m L } ,$ which exceeded MIC of nanoparticles against $P .$ aeruginosa and S. aureus by 20-fold. Thus,nanoparticles have potential for wound treatment owing to good cytocompatibility and effcient antibacterial activity.

In Vivo Study. To assess the wound healing status and effects on dermal tissue of healthy and diabetic rats after administration of $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A \mathrm { - } C _ { 4 } , }$ we photographed the wounds on the rats on days 1,8,12,18,and 24,and we performed histological evaluation of therat dermal woundson day 24 after treatment.Data from the representative wound photographs of diabetic rats(Figure 8A-E）revealed that the wounds of the treatment group healed after 24 days,similar to that of the drug control and blank control groups.However, wounds of the model group visibly deteriorated with lower rates of healing owing to their damaged immune systems.As shown in the photographs of healthy rats (Figure 8J-N), wounds of the treatment group healed after 24 days and showed faster healing than the model group. From representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histological images of diabetic(Figure 8F-I) and healthy(Figure $8 \mathrm { O - R } )$ rats,epithelialization,formation of granulation tissue, and contraction of underlying wound connective tissues were observed,which are indicative of wound healing.However，as shown in Figure 8 (G,P),the wounds did not heal,and massive inflammatory cells were observed at the wound site due to infection without perfect repair in the model group.Therefore, $\mathrm { A g N P s  @ P D M A E M A - C _ { 4 } }$ not only had no effect on dermal tissue but also promoted wound healing,especially in bodies with damaged immune systems.

# CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion，we have successfully synthesized an effective antimicrobial nanoparticle by covalent attachment of thiol endcapped PDMAEMA $C _ { 4 }$ to $\mathbf { A g N P s }$ .Owing to the polyvalent and synergistic antibacterial functions of these nanoparticles, antimicrobial activity was strongly enhanced with no bacterial resistance.The novel nanoparticle increased bacterial cytoplasmic membrane permeability,causing membrane disruption,and subsequently penetrated cells and strongly inhibited intracellular enzyme activity, leading to cell death.Moreover，our nanoparticle promoted healing after P. aeruginosa- and S. aureus-induced infection.Notably, the same curative effect was observed in a diabetic rat model，indicating that $\operatorname { A g N P s } \ @$ PDMAEMA- $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ acts as an efficient antimicrobial material with potential for treating bacteria-induced infections in patients with low immunity.
