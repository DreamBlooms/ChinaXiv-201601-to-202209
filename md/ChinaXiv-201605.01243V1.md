# SUMMARY

Cells adapt to temperature shifts by adjusting levels of lipid desaturation and membrane fluidity. This fundamental process occurs in nearly all forms of life，but its mechanism in eukaryotes is unknown. We discovered that the evolutionarily conserved Caenorhabditis elegans gene acdh-11 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [ACDH]) facilitates heat adaptation by regulating the lipid desaturase FAT-7. Human ACDH deficiency causes the most common inherited disorders of fattyacid oxidation,with syndromes that areexacerbated by hyperthermia. Heatupregulates acdh-11 expression to decrease fat-7 expression. We solved the high-resolution crystal structure of ACDH-11 and established the molecular basis of its selective and high-affinity bindingto C11/C12-chain fatty acids. ACDH-11 sequesters C11/C12-chain fatty acids and prevents these fatty acids from activating nuclear hormone receptors and driving fat-7 expression. Thus， the ACDH-11 pathway drives heatadaptation by linking temperature shifts to regulation of lipid desaturase levels and membrane fluidity via an unprecedented mode of fatty acid signaling.

# INTRODUCTION

How cells respond to changes in temperature is a fundamental issue in biology (de Mendoza, 2014; Jordt et al., 2003; Sengupta and Garrity, 2013). Changes in ambient temperature affect nearly all cellular and biochemical processes and drive adaptive responses to maintain cellular homeostasis.For example,up- or down-shifts in temperature increase or decrease the fluidity of the cytoplasmic membrane，respectively.To maintain membrane fluiditywithin an optimal range for normal biological activity,lipid desaturases in the cell convertsaturated fattyacids into unsaturated fattyacids to increase lipid desaturation and thus membrane fluidity in response to temperature downshifts (de Mendoza, 2014; Flowers and Ntambi， 2008; Holthuis and Menon，2014; Nakamura and Nara， 2004; Zhang and Rock, 2008).Unsaturated double bonds in lipids generate kinks into the otherwise straightened acyl hydrocarbon chain and thereby increase membrane fluidity.This fundamental process of maintaining membrane fluidity is called homeoviscous adaptation (HVA) and occurs in bacteria,archaea,and eukaryotes (Anderson et al., 1981; Cossins and Prosser， 1978; Shmeeda et al., 2002; Sinensky， 1974).

A two-component regulatory system mediates HVA in bacteria (Aguilar et al.， 2001; de Mendoza, 2014; Holthuis and Menon, 2014; Zhangand Rock,20o8). In Bacillus subtilis,temperature down-shifts induce the expression of the des gene，which encodes a lipid desaturase,Des.This induction is controlled by the DesK-DesR two-component system:upon temperature down-shift, the transmembrane histidine kinase DesK phosphorylatesand activates the response regulator DesR,which stimulates transcription of des.Activation of the DesK-DesR pathway enhancesthe survivalofBacillussubtilisatlowtemperatures. Whether regulation of lipid desaturation by this pathway is involved in heat adaptation remains unclear. Furthermore, neither DesK nor DesR has apparent homologs in eukaryotes, and specific biological pathways leading to lipid desaturase regulationand HVA in eukaryotes remain unknown.

Thenematode Caenorhabditis elegans isan ectotherm,i.e., its bodytemperature depends on external sources.C.elegans survives and reproduces optimally over an environmental temperature range of $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .Temperatures beyond this range cause physiological stress,reduction of fecundity,tissue damage,and necrosis (Kourtis et al., 2012;van Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto, 2014). Previous studies of C. elegans thermoregulation have focused on understanding how the heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 functions to maintain proteostasisand cytoskeletal integrity (Baird et al., 2014;van Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto, 2014; van Oosten-Hawle et al., 2013) and on sensory neural circuits and thermotaxis behavioral strategies that allow the animal to navigate a temperature gradient (Garrity et al., 2010; Hedgecock and Russell, 1975; Mori and Ohshima,1995;

Sengupta and Garity, 2013). Although the C. elegans genome encodes seven lipid desaturases that are evolutionarily conserved and involved in fatty acid regulation (Brock et al., 2006;Watts,20o9), the functions and mechanisms of HVA in C.elegans have not been explored.

We identified the C.elegans gene acdh-11 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) from a genetic screen exploring how this animal responds to conditions of changing oxygen and subsequently discovered that acdh-11 functions in HVA and does so by regulating levels of the stearic CoA desaturase (SCD) FAT-7. acdh-11 encodes a member of the evolutionarily conserved ACDH family,which is broadly involved in lipid $\beta$ -oxidation. To understand the mechanism of action of ACDH-11，we solved itshigh-resolution crystal structure.This structure helped us establish that ACDH-11 inhibits fat-7expression by sequestering C11/C12-chain fatty acids and preventing them from activating fat-7expression mediatedbythenuclear hormone receptor (NHR) NHR-49,a C.elegans homolog of the mammalian fatty acid-binding transcription factors ${ \mathsf { H N F } } 4 \alpha$ and PPARα (Antebi 2006; Ashrafi， 2007; Atherton et al., 2008; Evans and Mangelsdorf,2014; Van Gilst et al.，2005). Our findings demonstrate thatspecific intracellular fattyacids linkACDH-11inametabolic pathway to NHRs for transcriptional control of homeoviscous heat adaptation in C.elegans.We propose that these molecular principles and mechanisms are evolutionarilyconserved and modulate membrane lipid homeostasis and heat adaptation in other organisms.

# RESULTS

# acdh-11 Is Required for Heat Adaptation

We previously reported that the C.elegans gene egl-9 controls a behavioral response to reoxygenation (the O2-ON response) by regulating fatty acid-eicosanoid signaling (Ma etal.,2012, 2013). We examined other eg/ mutants originally isolated based on egglaying behavioral defects (Trent etal., 1983) and discovered that the previously uncloned gene egl-25 is also required for both normal egg laying and the O2-ON response (Figures S1AS1E).We molecularly identified egl-25 (Figures 1A and S1AS1E)as the gene paqr-2 (progestin and adipoQ receptor-2), the sequence of which has similarity to those of mammalian adiponectin receptors andwhich promotes the adaptation of C.elegans to cold temperature (Svensk et al.,2013; Svensson et al.,2011). Since the molecular function of this gene is unclear, we continue to refer to it by its original name，egl-25.We confirmed that eg/-25 promotes cold adaptationand the intestinal expression of the SCD gene fat-7(Svensk etal.,2013;Svensson et al., 2011) (Figures S1C and S1F).

We expressed a $P _ { f a t - 7 } .$ :fat-7:GFP fluorescent reporter (nls590) in the egl-25 mutant background to seek egl-25 suppressor mutations that can restore fat-7 levels (see Experimental Procedures).We isolated over 40 mutations that suppress egl-25, eight of which(n5655，n5657，n5661，n5876，n5877，n5878, n5879,n5880) belong to one complementation group and are alleles of a functionally uncharacterized gene named acdh-11 (Figure 1A). The amino acid sequence of ACDH-11 suggests that it is a long-chain ACDH involved in fatty acid $\beta$ -oxidation (Ashrafi, 2007; Srinivasan, 2015).acdh-11 genetically interacts with acs-3，which encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase (Ashrafi, 2007； Mullaney et al., 201O). The eight mutations we isolated include one deletionallele and three missense mutations,each of which disrupts an amino acid residue completely conserved among ACDH protein family members (Figures 1B and S2). Such loss-of-function mutations of acdh-11 restored only slightly the behavioral defects (in egg laying and the O2-ON response) of egl-25 mutants but caused dramatic upregulation of $P _ { f a t - 7 } \dot { . }$ fat-7:GFP in both egl-25 mutant and wild-type backgrounds (Figures 1C and 1D).

Because fat-7 encodes an SCD that catalyzes the limiting step oflipid desaturationand promotes membrane fluidity (de Mendoza,2014; Flowers and Ntambi, 2008),we monitored the extent of membrane fluidity in acdh-11 mutants using the fluorescent dye di-4-ANEPPDHQ (Owen et al., 2012).We found that the fluorescence spectrum of di-4-ANEPPDHQ was red-shifted (Figure S3A)，suggesting increased membrane fluidity.Using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) to quantify endogenous levels of various fatty acids，we found that acdh-11mutants were abnormal in their compositions of specific fattyacid species (Figure 2A). In particular,we observed a markedly reduced level ofstearicacid (C18:0,18 carbonatomsand 0 double bonds)，which is the most abundant saturated fatty acid in C.elegans (Figure 2A).The reduced level of C18:0, the metabolic substrate ofFAT-7,is consistentwith overexpression of $P _ { f a t }$ -7::fat-7:GFP inacdh-11mutants.These data indicate that ACDH-11 functions to decrease fat-7expression, the desaturation of the FAT-7 substrate stearic acid and membrane lipid fluidity.

Becausechanges inmembrane fluidityare essential foradaptationto temperature shifts,we next examined the temperature sensitivity of acdh-11 mutants.We found that acdh-11 null mutants embryos successfully developed to adulthood at $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ or $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ but failed to do so at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ (Figures 2B and 2C). Transgenic expression of wild-type acdh- $1 1 ( + )$ or decreasing membrane fluidity by supplementing acdh-11 mutants with the membrane-rigidifying agent DMSO (Lyman et al.，1976; Sangwan etal.,2o01) or reducing the fat-7 expression level bymutation rescued the $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ growth defect (Figure 2C).Since temperature higher than $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ causes heat stress, tissue necrosis and damage in C. elegans (Kourtis et al.,2012; van Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto,2014),we also examined survival of C.elegansadults at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and found that acdh-11 mutants but not acdh-11;fat-7 double mutants exhibited increased death rates compared withwild-type animals (Figure 2D).By contrast,both acdh-11 mutants and the wild-type exhibited similar sensitivity to other types of stress,including high osmolalityand oxidative stress (Figures S3B and S3C).These results indicate that ACDH-11 promotes C.elegans heatadaptation (also see below) by regulating fat-7 expression and membrane fluidity.

By contrast, fat-7 expression in the wild-type was strongly decreased at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ but increased in acdh-11 mutants，based upon both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and qPCR experiments (Figures 3C and 3D).This regulation of fat-7 by acdh-11 is highly specific to acdh-11,since knockdown of acdh-11 but not of the other 12 members of the acdh gene family in C.elegans by RNAi caused fat-7 upregulation (Figures 3E and 3F).Temperature and acdh-11affected fat-7 expression farmore than expression of other C.elegans fat genes encoding lipid desaturases,including fat-5 and fat-6,two close fat-7homologs in C.elegans (Figure 3C) (Murray et al., 2007;Watts, 2009).These results demonstrate upregulation of acdh-11 by heat and a highly gene-specific function for acdh-11 and elevated temperature in regulating the expression of fat-7,a member of the lipid desaturase gene family.These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that acdh-11andfat-7act inapathwayto facilitate C.elegans heat adaptation.

# ACDH-11 Crystal Structure RevealstheBasisofACDH11InteractionwithC11/C12-ChainFattyAcids

To understand the mechanism of action of ACDH-11,we solved its 3D crystal structure as well as its structure in a complex with acyl-CoA (Figure 4; Table S1). Recombinant C. elegans ACDH11was expressed from Escherichia coli,purified and crystallized (Li et al., 2010). The structure of ACDH-11 was determined by molecular replacement,and the final atomic model of ACDH11 was refined to $2 . 2 7 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ and $1 . 8 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ resolutions for the apo and the complex structures，respectively (Table S1).The overall structure is tetrameric (Figure 4A),consistent with our previous observation that the purified recombinant ACDH-11 (70 kDa monomer) is a $2 6 4 ~ \mathsf { k D a }$ protein in solution (Li et al., 201O).The monomer hasan overall fold similar to that of its two described homologs, the E.coli alkylation response protein AidB (Bowles et al.,20o8)and the human very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) (McAndrew etal.,2008). Each ACDH-11 monomer consists of an N-terminal $\alpha$ -helical domain (residues 1-200, $\mathfrak { a }$ -domain1),aseven-stranded $\beta$ sheet domain (residues 201- 320， $\alpha$ -domain2)，acentral $\alpha$ -helical domain (residues 321- 480, $\alpha$ -domain 3),and a C-terminal $\alpha$ -helical domain (Figure 4B). The tetramer comprises a dimer of dimers,with each subunit providing two loops important for stabilizing the dimer-dimer interaction (Figures 4Aand S4A-S4E).

Long-chain ACDHs catalyze the initial step of fatty acid $\beta$ -oxidation,thedehydrogenationofacyl-CoAs,withsubstratebinding pockets that accommodate long-chain fatty acids of varying alkyl chain lengths (Grevengoed et al., 2014).To determine how the interaction of ACDH-11 with its substrates likely impacts HVA,weanalyzed the classes of fattyacids that bind to the lipid binding pocket of ACDH-11.We found that ACDH11 harbored the acyl chain of the fattyacid C11-CoA as a ligand in the crystal (Figures 4C and 5A-5E).C11-CoA was deeply buried inside a $1 4 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ -depth binding cavity of ACDH-11,the depth of which was restricted by two residues,Tyr344 and Leu159, limiting the maximum carbon length to C12 (Figures 4C and 5A).The temperature B-factors (Woldeyes et al.,2014),which indicate the motilities of these two amino acids (Tyr 344 and Leu 159),are relatively low across the entire ACDH-11 sequence (Figure 5B). The ligand-free apo-structure of ACDH-11 displays the same conformation of Tyr 344 and Leu 159 (Figures S5C and S5D),further supporting the conclusion that the size of the binding cavitywould notaccommodate fattyacid carbon lengths longer than C12.

See also Figure S4 and Table S1.

The structure reveals that strong binding of ACDH-11 to C11-CoA is mediated by at least ten hydrogen bond interactions (Figure 5A)，including one between Ser 267 and the

$3 ^ { \prime }$ -phosphate on the CoA moiety;two between the side chain of Asn 331 and the N2 and N3 nitrogens of the adenine ring; two between the side chain of Arg 321 and the O4 and O5 oxygens in the adenosine $_ { 3 ^ { \prime } , 5 ^ { \prime } }$ -diphosphate group; two between the side chain of Arg 476 and the O9 and O10 oxygens of the pyrophosphate portion; two between the side chain of Arg334 and the O1 and O2 oxygens of the peptidyl portion;and one between the main chain of Ser215 and the N2 nitrogen of the peptidyl portion.We compared the structure of ACDH11 bound with C11-CoA with other structurally characterized ACDHs (SCAD，MCAD，and VLCAD) (Battaile et al.，2002; Kim et al.，1993； McAndrew et al.，2008) and found that ACDH-11 provides more hydrogen bonds (Figure S6) than other ACDHs and binds to the acyl chain via hydrophobic interactions that are defined by a deep binding pocket (Figure 5A). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),we quantified the binding affinities of C12-CoA and C8，C10,C12 fatty acids (wetested these even number chain-fattyacids,since their synthetic forms are readily available) to purified ACDH-11. The ITC results (Figures 5C-5E) showed that the disassociation constants for C10，C12，and C12-CoA binding to purified ACDH-11 are $2 1 . 3 ~ \pm ~ 2 . 6 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ ， $1 0 . 3 ~ \pm ~ 2 . 4 ~ \mu \ M _ { \cdot }$ and $5 . 2 ~ \pm$ $1 . 3 ~ \mu \mu$ ，respectively,and no significant binding was detected for C8 (Figures S5G and S5H).These biochemical results demonstrate the selectivity of ACDH-11 for fatty acids with chain lengths from C10 to C12, fully consistent with our conclusions based on structural observations.We obtained the structure of the complex without having added any ligand sup plement during crystal growth,as C11-CoA presumablywas tightly sequestered by ACDH-11 during the step of protein expression in E. coli.

# ACDH-11,C11/C12-FattyAcids,andNHR-49Actina Pathwayto Drive Heat Adaptation

The strong and selective binding of C11/C12-chain fatty acids to ACDH-11 indicated by the crystal structure of ACDH-11 could explain the functional specificity of ACDH-11 in regulating fat-7 expression and heat adaptation.Specifically，we hypothesize that heat-induced ACDH-11 sequesters intracellular C11/C12- chain fattyacids,whichare required foractivatingnuclearfat-7 expression through fattyacid-regulated transcription factors.

To test this hypothesis,we examined whether supplementing C.elegans with exogenous fatty acids of various lengths could stimulate fat-7 expression.We tested effects of a fatty acid series from C3 to C20 on the expression of $P _ { f a t - 7 } .$ :fat-7::GFP. At $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ,this reporter was turned off (Figure 6A).Most of the fatty acids had no significant effects on FAT-7:GFP expression. By contrast,C10,C11,and C12 activated reporter expression in markedly higher fractions of the animals (Figure 6A).The activity of C10 was lower than that of C11 and C12.fat-7 is a known transcriptional target of NHR-49 (Pathare et al., 2012; Van Gilst etal.,20o5),aC.elegans homologof the mammalian transcription factors PPARα and ${ \mathsf { H N F } } 4 \alpha$ ，which are known to bind fatty acids, including C12 (Dhe-Paganon etal., 2002).We found that nhr-49 RNAi eliminated the effect of C11 or C12 in activating FAT-7:GFP (Figure 6B).nhr-49 RNAi ormutations also completely blocked overexpression ofFAT-7::GFP inacdh-11 mutants (Figures 6B and S7A).NHR-49 shares high sequence identity $( 3 7 \%$ amino acid residues;Figures S7B and S7C)with ${ \mathsf { H N F } } 4 \alpha$ (Dhe-Paganon et al.， 2002)，suggesting that NHR-49 likely exhibits a fatty acid-binding pocket that can accommodate C11/C12 fatty acids.These results indicate that C11/C12 requires NHR-49 to activate fat-7 expression and that ACDH-11 sequesters C11/C12 fatty acids and thereby prevents them fromactivating nuclear fat-7 expression.

# DISCUSSION

Based on our observations,we propose a model for how ACDH11 regulates C.elegans heat adaptation (Figure 7).Under cold conditions (e.g., $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ ,intracellular C11/C12 fattyacids promote fat-7 expression via fatty acid-regulated nuclear receptors (e.g., NHR-49). Upregulation of fat-7 promotes lipid desaturation and thus membrane fluidity，which is an adaptation to cold.As a PAQR-related transmembrane protein with a ceramidase or phospholipase-like domain (Pei etal.,2011), EGL-25 likely acts to increase levels of C11/C12 and hence promote signaling in cooperation with NHR-49 (Svensk et al., 2013) and other NHRs (Brock et al.， 2006; Pathare et al.， 2012) for cold adaptation. Our data suggest that intracellular $\tt C 1 1 / \tt C 1 2$ fatty acids activate fat-7 expression via NHRs,which likely require lipid-transporting proteins to transduce C11/C12 fatty acid signals into the nucleus; however,we do not exclude the possibility that C11/C12 fatty acids might be further metabolized or processed to indirectly modulate NHR activation.In the cold,acdh-11 is expressed at low levels and has little or no function.

Under heat conditions (e.g., $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ ,acdh-11 is transcriptionally upregulated，and elevated levels of the ACDH-11 protein sequester intracellular C11/C12,preventing downstream NHR activationand consequent fat-7 expression, therebypromoting lipid saturation and membrane rigidity in response to heat. Upstream sensors and mediators of this heat-induced acdh-11 upregulation remain to be identified.At high temperature，in both wild-type animals and egl-25 mutants C11/C12 is sequestered by ACDH-11，resulting in normal adaption to heat. By contrast,in egl-25;acdh-11 double mutants as well as in acdh-11 single mutants，C11/C12 is not sequestered by ACDH-11,and its consequent higher levels drive fat-7 expression (although fat-7 expression requires NHR-49,our data do not preclude the possibility that ACDH-11 sequestration of C11/C12 also prevents the activation of other NHRs).The resultingmembrane lipid desaturation causes excessive membrane fluidity and thus a failure to adapt to heat.The genetic epistatic interactions among egl-25,acdh-11,and nhr-49, the high penetrance of their corresponding mutant phenotypes (Figures 1 and S7A)as well as mechanistic insights from the ACDH-11 structure together strongly support this model.

In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells，SCD fatty acid desaturasescatalyze the limitingstepof fattyaciddesaturation and mediate HVA by maintaining optimal ranges of membrane fluidity in response to temperature shifts (Cossins and Prosser, 1978; de Mendoza, 2014; Flowers and Ntambi, 2008; Sinensky, 1974； Zhang and Rock， 20o8).

Figure7. Model forACDH-11Function   
Model showing proposed mechanism for how the ACDH-11 pathway mediates C11/C12 fatty acid signaling and heat adaptation.Heat upregulates ACDH-11，which prevents C11/C12 from activating NHRs and fat-7 expression，leading to low levels of membrane lipid desaturation and reduced membrane fluidity for adaptation to heat (see text for details).Light blue indicates low protein activity or a low level of protein abundance. $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ represent low and high temperatures,respectively. See also Figure S7.

2011).Our findings support this hypothesis and further identify functional roles of ACDH-11 and C11/C12 fatty acids in the egl-25 and fat-7 pathway to control HVA in C.elegans.Unlike long-chain fatty acids that are well-known to mediate various cell signaling processes,sequestration of medium-chain C11/C12 fatty acids by ACDH-11 representsan unprecedented mode of fatty acid signaling. The novel pathwayand mechanisms we have discovered provide a molecular basis for homeoviscous heatadaptation in C.elegans,shedding light on a longstanding mystery concerninga fundamentalcellbiologicalproblem.

Mutations in human ACDH genes cause disorders of fatty acid oxidation thatbecome life-threateningunder fever orhyperthermia (Jank et al.， 2014; O'Reilly et al., 2004; Zolkipli et al., 2011), with responses that are analogous to the vulnerability of C. elegans acdh-11 mutants to heat. Although maintaininga sufficient diet is currentlythe standardof-care management option to prevent symptoms of ACDH-deficiency in human patients,hyperthermia isa more significant independent risk factor than hyposystems,which are not present in eukaryotes,link membrane sensing of temperature shifts to nuclear transcription of desaturase genes for HVA (Aguilar et al.， 2001; de Mendoza, 2014). Eukaryotic organisms,including warm-blooded animals，also exhibit HVA (Anderson et al.,1981; Cossins and Prosser, 1978; Shmeeda et al.，2oo2)，a phenomenon far less studied and understood than bacterial HVA. Unlike systemic thermoregulation,eukaryotic HVA likely evolved as a mechanism to locally and cell-autonomously respond to temperature shifts.Cold temperature upregulates the plasma levels of adiponectin in humans (lmbeault et al.，20o9),although roles of adiponectin andits receptors in HVA have not been explored.C.elegans SCDs and adiponectin receptor homologs have been proposed to regulate cold adaptation (Svensk et al., 2013; Svensson et al., glycemia (Rinaldo et al., 2002; Wolfe et al., 1993; Zolkipli et al., 2011).Our findings suggest that imbalance of lipid desaturation contributes to heat sensitivity of human ACDH-deficient patients and that therapeutic targeting of lipid desaturases might alleviate the thermo-sensitive syndrome of human ACDH-deficient patients.In addition,we found that ACDH-11 acts in a metabolic pathway to modulate activation of nuclear receptors by sequestering C11/C12 fatty acids,a plausiblywidespread mechanismof controlling intracellular fattyacid signaling.Given that lipid metabolism and signaling are fundamentally similar between nematodes and other organisms (Ashrafi， 2007; Grevengoed et al.，2014; Holthuis and Menon，2014; McKay et al., 2003; Nakamura and Nara, 2004; Srinivasan, 2015; Watts, 2009),we propose that the pathway and mechanisms we have identified for C.elegans are evolutionarily conserved and modulate lipid metabolic homeostasis as well as thermal adaptation-associated physiological and pathological processes in other organisms,including humans.

# EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

# EMSMutagenesis,GeneticScreens,andWhole-Genome Sequencing

To screen for $e g { \mid } \ – 2 5$ suppressors，we mutagenized egl-25(n573) mutants carrying the $P _ { f a t - 7 }$ :fat-7:GFP transgene nls590 with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)and observed the F2 progeny using a dissecting microscope and GFP fluorescence at $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ .We isolated suppressor mutants with restored expression of $P _ { f a t - 7 } .$ :fat- $\cdot 7 { \because } G F P$ in egl-25 mutants.We mapped the suppressor mutations using standard genetic techniques based on polymorphic SNPs between the Bristol strain N2 and the Hawaiian strain CB4856 (Davis et al., 2005).We used whole-genome sequencing to identify the mutations; data analyseswere performed as described (Sarin et al., 2008).

# Mutationsand Strains

C.elegans strains were cultured as described (Brenner,1974).The N2 Bristol strain (Brenner,1974) was the reference wild-type strain,and the polymorphic Hawaiian strain CB4856 (Wicks et al., 20o1) was used for genetic mapping and SNP analysis.Mutations used were as follows:LG I, nhr-49(nr2041) (Van Gilst et al.,2005); LG Il,egl-25(n573,gk395168,ok3136) (Thomps0n et al.,2013; Trent et al.，1983)，acdh-11(n5655，n5657，n5661，n5876，n5877，n5878, n5879,n5880,gk753061);LG V,and fat-7(wa36) (Watts and Browse,2000). $g k 3 9 5 1 6 8$ and $g k 7 5 3 0 6 1$ (molecular null,causing an L119-to-amber stop codon) were obtained from the Milion Mutation Project and outcrossed six times (Thompson et al., 2013).

Transgenic strains were generated by germline transformation (Mello et al., 1991).Transgenic constructs were co-injected (at $1 0 { - } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \ n g / \mu l } )$ with mCherry reporters,and lines of mCherry-positive animals were established.Gamma irradiation was used to generate integrated transgenes.Transgenic strains used were as follows: $n / s 5 9 0 [ P _ { f a t - 7 }$ ::fat-7:GFP] (integrated from the extrachromosomalarraywaEx1 $5 [ P _ { t a t - 7 } . : G F P + I i n 7 5 ( + ) J )$ (Brock et al.,2006); nls616[egl$2 5 ( + ) _ { 3 }$ ：Punc-54::mCherryl；nls677[Pacdh-11::GFP；Punc-54::mCherry];nEx2270 [acdh-11(+);Punc-54::mCherry].

# Protein Purification, Structure Determination,Model Building, andRefinement

Protein was expressed and purified as described (Li et al., 2010).Briefly, the acdh-11 gene was amplified and cloned into the expression vector pEXSDH(derived from pET-22b, Novagen).8xHis-tagged ACDH-11 was expressed in the E.coli strain BL21 (DE3) and isolated from the cell lysate by $N i 2 +$ -NTA (QIAGEN) affinity chromatography.ACDH-11 was further purified using ion exchange chromatography (RESOURCE S column,GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 100/300 GL Column,GE Healthcare).For crystallization,ACDH-11 was concentrated to $1 2 \mathrm { m g / m l }$ in $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ Tris $\mathsf { p H } 8 . 0$ ，150 mM NaCl.Large yellow crystals grew in $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } \mathsf { M }$ Tris pH 8.0, $2 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ magnesium formate,and $13 \%$ PEG 3350 through siting-drop vapor diffusion at $1 6 ^ { \circ } C$

Immediately prior to data collection,the ACDH-11 crystal was quickly soaked in cryoprotectant solution ( $1 3 \%$ PEG 3350 and $20 \%$ glycerol) and flash-cooled at $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { K }$ in a stream of nitrogen gas.The high-resolution diffraction data set for the complex structure was collected on beamline BL5A of the Photon Factory (KEK).The diffraction data set for the apo structure was collected on beamline BL17U of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF).The structure of ACDH-11 was resolved by molecular replacement using the program Phaser (McCoy et al.，2007)．ACDH-11 shares $30 \%$ sequence identity with E.coli AidB (Bowles et al.，20o8),and the refined coordinates of AidB were used to construct the search model.The programs Coot (Emsley and Cowtan,2004) and Refmac5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) were used for manual model building and refinement.The difference-Fourier map exhibited long and continuous electron densities corresponding to the FAD co-factor acyl-CoA.The length of acyl-chain was determined according to the electron density.C11-CoA was assigned because of its best RSCC (real space correlation coefficient,see Figures 5E and 5F).The statistics of data collection and structural refinement are summarized in Table S1.

The coordinates for the final refined model were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession number 4Y9J for the C11-CoA bound structure and 4Y9L for the C11-CoA free structure of ACDH-11.

# Isothermal Titration Calorimetry

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed with a MicroCal iTC-200 titration micro-calorimeter (GE Healthcare) at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ The sample cell was filled with ACDH-11 $( 2 5 ~ \mu \ M$ in $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ MES, $\mathsf { p H } 6 . 5$ ，and $10 \%$ glycerol).ACDH-11 concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method.The free fatty acids C8,C10,C12 and C14,and C12- CoA $( 8 0 0 ~ \mu \mathsf { M } )$ prepared in the same buffer were injected into the sample cell in 2-min time intervals.Twenty injections in total were conducted within $4 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The reaction solution contained $1 \%$ DMSO to increase the solubility of fattyacids.As negative control,the ligands were titrated into the buffer without ACDH-11 proteins.All experiments were repeated five times.The data were processed using the Origin software (Version 7.0).

# GeneExpressionAnalyses

For qPCR and RNA-Seq experiments,total RNA from age-synchronized young adult $( 2 4 \ h r$ post-L4) hermaphrodites (20o in total,picked manually)was prepared using TissueRuptor and the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN).Reverse transcription was performed by SuperScript Ill,and quantitative PCRwas performed using Applied Biosystems Real-Time PCR Instruments.The specific intron-spanning primer sequences used were:act-3 forward:TCCAT CATGAAGTGCGACAT;act-3 reVerse:TAGATCCTCCGATCCAGACG；fat-7 forward:ACGAGCTTGTCTTCCATGCT；fat-7reverse:AGCCCATTCAATGA TGTCGT;acdh-11 forward:TTGATCCATTTGTTCGGAGA;acdh-11 reverse: GGTGGCTAGCTTGTGCTTTC.RNA-seq was performed by the llumina TruSeq chemistry,and data were analyzed using standard protocols (Trapnell et al., 2010).

Nomarski and GFP fluorescence images of anesthetized C.e/egans were obtained using an Axioskop I (Zeiss) compound microscope and OpenLab software (Agilent)．The fraction of FAT-7::GFP-positive animals observed was quantified by counting animals using a dissecting microscope equipped for the detection of GFP fluorescence.
