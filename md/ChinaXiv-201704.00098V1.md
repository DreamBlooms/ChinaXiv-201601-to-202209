# I.INTRODUCTION

H OTDEFORMED(HD) Nd-Fe-B magnets exhibit good magnetic performance [1],[2], corrosion resistance [3], [4] and thermal stability [5]. Therefore,increased attention has been drawn to them in both basic and application research fields [6]-[8], focusing mainly on ring-shaped and cylindrical HD magnets [9]. Today,a ring-shaped HD magnet could be easily prepared by a special hot deformation technique called backward extrusion method. Detailed investigation revealed that its magnetic performance was inhomogeneous along both axial and radial directions [1O]. In the axial direction,remanence $( B _ { \mathrm { r } } )$ increased monotonically from the top to bottom part of the ring-shaped HD magnet while coercivity $( H _ { \mathrm { c i } } )$ decreased simultaneously [11],[12]. In the radial direction, a ring-shaped HD magnet displayed an approximate linear enhancement of $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ from the outer to inner surface [6],[13]. For the cylindrical HD magnet, Guruswamy et al. presented a theoretical investigation on the inhomogeneity of deformation via simulation method using a finite-element-based software called “ANTARES” [14]. However, systematic experimental investigations were not reported on the homogeneities of the magnetic performance in cylindrical HD magnets along either the radial or axial direction.

For metals and alloys with a cylindrical shape, it was reported that material flow during plastic deformation is uneven in the axial direction due to the existence of friction at both end surfaces contacted with punches [15]. Therefore,material flow at the axiallymiddle cross-section is easier than that at end surfaces.As a ternary alloy,Nd-Fe-B could be deformed from a thin cylinder into a fat one at $6 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 8 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [16], [17]. The unevenness of material flow in a Nd-Fe-B magnet during this deformation was merely mentioned in [18]. No further experimental investigation was carried out to the best of our knowledge.

In this paper, the inhomogeneities of magnetic performance were demonstrated both in the axial and radial directions.The origins of the inhomogeneities were revealed in terms of microstructures and the material flow during deformation.

# II.EXPERIMENTAL WORK

Melt-spun powder (MQU-F） was purchased from Magnequench International, Inc.,and used as raw material without any treatment. The powder was firstly compacted into a green body $( \Phi 1 3 \mathrm { \ m m * 2 4 \ m m } )$ under vacuum at $9 4 3 \mathrm { K }$ and a pressure of $2 0 0 \mathrm { M P a }$ .Then the green body was deformed in a tungsten carbide（WC） die at $1 1 1 3 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ under argon atmosphere.The illustrations of the compaction and deformation were presented in[19].HD magnets with the height reduction (HR) of $2 8 . 1 \%$ $5 3 . 2 \%$ and $70 \%$ were prepared using WC dies with the diameters of $1 5 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ， $1 9 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ .They were denoted as HDM-1，HDM-2 and HDM-3,respectively. Cylindrical samples (type-I) with the dimensions of $\Phi 6 \ \mathrm { m m } * 6$ mm were cut off from the HD magnet with the HR of $70 \%$ ,as shown in Fig.1.The magnetic performance of type-I samples was measured along the easy direction,which is parallel to the pressing direction,with a closed circuit B-Happaratus at room temperature.The samples were premagnetized with a dc pulse field of $2 9 \mathrm { k O e }$ Rectangular samples (type-II) with the dimensions of $1 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m m } * 1 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m m } * 2$ mm were cut off from the HD magnet with the HR of $2 8 . 1 \%$ and $5 3 . 2 \%$ ，as shown in Fig. 2. Their magnetic performance was measured along the easy axis through a Lakeshore 740o vibrating sample magnetometer(VSM) in an applied field up to $2 3 \mathrm { \ k O e }$ without demagnetization field correction. The phase composition was identified using an X-ray diffractometer(XRD,Bruker AXS D8 Advance) with $\mathrm { C u } ~ \mathrm { K } \alpha$ radiation.Microstructures of samples were examined on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800).

# III.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table I presents the $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ ， $H _ { \mathrm { c i } }$ and maximum energy product $( ( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } } )$ of the type-I samples cut from different positions of HDM-3 along radial direction. Both $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ decrease monotonically from positions a to c.The maximum difference in $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ is about $0 . 5 3 \mathrm { k G s }$ and $3 . 4 \ : \mathrm { M G O e }$ . But $H _ { \mathrm { c i } }$ firstly increases from $1 4 . 7 2 \mathrm { k O e }$ at position a to $1 5 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { k O e }$ at position b and then decreases to $1 5 . 0 8 \mathrm { k O e }$ at position c.These results reveal that the magnetic performance of cylindrical HD magnet is inhomogeneous along the radial direction. $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ at the center are higher than those at the edge.

To reveal the reasons for the declined $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ along the radial direction,microstructures were examined with SEM over the cross sections of the type-I samples.The results are shown in Fig. 1. At position a, $\mathrm { N d _ { 2 } F e _ { 1 4 } B }$ grains exhibit platelet shape and good alignment [Fig. 1(a)]. The thickness of these grains is about $1 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ .At position b, some coarse grains appear while most remain platelet [Fig. 1(b)]. At position c [Fig.1(c)], the number of coarse grains increased remarkably.Meanwhile, it should be noted that the alignment orientation of $\mathrm { N d _ { 2 } F e _ { 1 4 } B }$ grains at position c is not parallel with that at position a and b.Grain coarsening was reported to be an important reason for the decline of crystal alignment in the HD magnet[1O].But the above results further reveal the key role of orientation difference in the deterioration of crystal alignment and consequent $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ =

Fig.2 shows the magnetic performance of the type-II samples cut from different axial positions of HDM-1 and HDM-2. Both of them show inhomogeneous magnetic performance in the axial direction. Concretely, $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ at positions 2 and 3 are much higher than those at positions 1 and 4.When HR is $2 8 . 1 \%$ [Fig. 2(a)], the highest $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ are $1 0 . 4 \mathrm { k G s }$ and 25.0 MGOe. The corresponding samples are located at position 3. The lowest $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ are measured to be $9 . 1 \mathrm { k G s }$ and $1 9 . 0 \ \mathrm { M G O e }$ on the samples at position 1. The difference between them in $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ is $1 . 3 \mathrm { ~ k G s }$ and $6 . 0 \mathrm { M G O e }$ respectively.When HR is $5 3 . 2 \%$ [Fig.2(b)], the highest $\boldsymbol { B } _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ increase to $1 3 . 0 \mathrm { k G s }$ and 38.1 MGOe at position 3 and the lowest to $1 0 . 2 \mathrm { k G s }$ and 23.2 MGOe at position1. The difference between them in $\boldsymbol { B } _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ is enlarged to $2 . 8 \mathrm { k G s }$ and 14.9 MGOe, respectively. The above results reveal that the axiallymiddle part of the cylindricalHD magnet exhibits higher $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ and $( B H ) _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ than both end parts.On the other hand, $H _ { \mathrm { c i } }$ displays an opposite variation over axial position when HR is $2 8 . 1 \%$ .The samples at positions 2 and 3 have significantly lower $H _ { \mathrm { { c i } } }$ than those at positions 1 and 4. But when HR is $5 3 . 2 \%$ $H _ { \mathrm { c i } }$ displays a monotonic decrease from $1 7 . 3 ~ \mathrm { k O e }$ at position 1 to $1 5 . 7 \mathrm { k O e }$ at position 4.The reason for this phenomenon needs further investigation.

As $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ of the HD magnet is determined by texture to a great extent, the texture of HDM-3 was evaluated with XRD over two end surfaces and the interface between sample 2 and 3.The results are shown in Fig.3.For the interface between samples 2 and 3,the intensity of(Oo4), (0o6) and (Oo8) crystal planes is much higher than the others,indicating good texture at this interface.Both end surfaces,however, exhibit little texture.The big difference in texture along the axial direction accounts for the axial inhomogeneity of the magnetic performance in the HD magnet.

To reveal the origins of texture difference along axial direction,an intermediate HD magnet with HR of $5 3 . 2 \%$ was prepared using a WC die with the diameter of $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ (maximum HR is $70 \%$ ).Fig.4 represents the photograph of this intermediate HD magnet and its dimensions.The intermediate magnet appears like a barrel whose axially middle part bulges out [Fig. 4(a)]. The diameters along its axial direction are different [Fig. 4(b)]. The diameter of the two end surfaces is $1 7 . 7 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，which is the minimum. The maximum diameter is $2 1 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ , located at the middle of the magnet in the axial direction. The thickness of the intermediate magnet is $9 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$

This barrel-like shape should result from the unevenness in the plastic deformation of Nd-Fe-B alloy due to the existence of friction at both end surfaces contacted with punches [15].

Deformation degree $( \eta )$ could be evaluated in two ways. One is byheight reduction (HR) as follows [20]:

$$
\eta = H R = { \frac { h _ { 0 } - h } { h _ { 0 } } }
$$

where $h _ { 0 }$ is the height of green body before hot deformation, and $h$ is the height of HD magnet. Alternatively, deformation degree could also be calculated from the cross-section area of cylindrical HD magnet with the following:

$$
\eta = \frac { S - S _ { 0 } } { S } = 1 - \left( \frac { d _ { 0 } } { d } \right) ^ { 2 }
$$

where $d _ { 0 }$ and $d$ are the diameters ofcylindrical magnets before and after hot deformation. $S _ { 0 }$ and $\boldsymbol { S }$ are the cross-section areas of cylindrical magnets before and after hot deformation.Due to the constant volume of the magnet before and after deformation, the above two methods are equivalent for the cylindrical HD magnet. But when it comes to the barrel-shaped intermediate HD magnet, only (2) is appropriate for evaluating deformation degree.Equation(1) just presents an average deformation degree of the whole magnet.For the as-prepared intermediate magnet, $\eta$ is estimated to be $5 3 . 2 \%$ from $h ( 9 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ and $h _ { 0 } ( 2 1 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ by (1).Nonetheless, $\eta$ is calculated to be $4 4 . 4 \%$ by(2) from the minimum diameter $( 1 7 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ at the end surface of the intermediate magnet and $6 1 . 2 \%$ from the maximum （204 $( 2 1 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m m } )$ at the middle cross section. Such a difference in $\eta$ plays an important role in the variation of texture and consequent $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ along the axial direction.

Table II lists the magnetic performance of IM series samples 中 $\mathrm { 1 . 5 ~ m m * 1 . 5 ~ m m * 2 ~ m m }$ cut from different axial regions of the intermediate HD magnet (Fig. 5). The $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ of sample IM-2 $( 1 3 . 5 6 ~ \mathrm { k G s } )$ is much higher than that of IM-1( $( 1 0 . 9 2 \mathrm { k G s } )$ and IM-3 $( 9 . 9 5 \mathrm { k G s } )$ . This is consistent with the variations of both $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ in Fig.2 and texture in Fig.3,confirming the key role of $\eta$ in the variation of $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ along axial direction.

# IV.CONCLUSION

Cylindrical HD magnet exhibits inhomogeous magnetic performance in both radial and axial directions.Along the radial direction, $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ at position a is higher than that at position c due to the orientation variation and grain coarsening at the edge. In the axial direction, the HD magnet shows a higher $B _ { \mathrm { r } }$ at the axially middle region than that near both end surfaces,which is ascribed to the variation of texture at different axial positions Furthermore,such variation in texture results from the unevenness of deformation degree due to the existence of friction at both end surfaces contacted with punches.
