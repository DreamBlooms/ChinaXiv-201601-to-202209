# I.INTRODUCTION

civity sintered magnets for the motors of hybrid electric vehicles. The coercivity at room temperature of the Nd-Fe-B magnets should be higher than $3 0 \mathrm { \ k O e }$ for an operating temperature of ${ \sim } 2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [1].One way to achieve this is the substitution ofDyforNd,which increases the cost due to the scarcity of Dy. The other way for acquiring high coercivity is to refine the grain size of the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ phase in the magnets. By means of reducing the grain size to $1 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,Dy-free sintered magnets with coercivity of $1 9 \mathrm { k O e }$ were prepared [2]. However,it is difficult to decrease the grain size to $< 1 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ in the sintered magnets for higher coercivity at present.

The hydrogenation disproportionation desorption recombination (HDDR） process is an effective method to produce powders with an average grain size of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ，equaling to the size of single magnetic domain for ${ \mathrm { N d } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { F e } } _ { 1 4 } { \mathrm { B } }$ . This is a very useful technique for the production of high performance anisotropic bonded magnets or hot-pressing/deformed magnets [3],[4].But, the coercivity of the HDDR magnets still remains not very high in spite of their finer submicrometer grain size.According to the previous report [5], this was attributed to the exchange coupling of the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains caused by the lack of Nd-rich phase along the grain boundary. So,the modification of boundary layers becomes a key point to increase the coercivity of the HDDR magnets expected from magnetically isolated single domain particles.In this paper, the diffusion process of NdCu eutectic alloy into HDDR magnets was used for Nd enrichment at the grain boundaries,which is beneficial for the coercivity enhancement. The relationship between the microstructures of the magnets and the coercivity has been discussed in detail.

# II.EXPERIMENT

Alloy ingots with nominal composition of $\mathrm { N d } _ { 1 3 . 5 } \mathrm { F e } _ { \mathrm { b a l } } \mathrm { C o } _ { 6 . 0 }$ $\mathbf { Z r } _ { 0 . 1 } \mathbf { A l } _ { 1 . 5 } \mathbf { G a } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathbf { B } _ { 6 . 5 }$ were prepared by induction melting under an argon atmosphere. The ingots were homogenized at $1 1 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for elimination of $\boldsymbol { a }$ -Fe and pulverized into powders with a particle size of $< 1 5 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ ，For HDDR process，the powders of the alloy ingots were heated up to $7 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 8 4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a closed chamber with continuous hydrogen flow. After holding for $2 \mathrm { - } 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ with hydrogen pressure of $5 0 \ \mathrm { k P a }$ ，the DR process was carried on: hydrogen desorption under a pressure of $1 { - } 5 \ \mathrm { { k P a } }$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 1 h }$ and recombination under a high vacuum of $< 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ Pa for $0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at the same temperature.

After the steps described previously, the HDDR-processed ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ powders were used to prepare hot-pressing magnets. First,a cylinder of green compact was obtained under an alignment field of $2 \mathrm { ~ T ~ }$ perpendicular to the pressing direction and then isostatically processed at a $1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { \ M P a }$ pressure. After that the as-got compact was put into an alloyed die followed by hot pressing at $7 4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under $2 7 0 \ \mathrm { \ M P a }$ in vacuum with a processing time of $5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . This alloyed die is made from tungsten steel with an inner diameter of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ The hot-pressing direction was parallel to the cylinder axis which is perpendicular to the initial pressing direction and parallel to the alignment direction. Bulk hot-pressed sample of $\Phi 1 0 \ \mathrm { \ m m } \ \times \ 1 2 \ \mathrm { \ m m }$ was acquired and its density was $7 . 5 4 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ . The $\mathrm { N d } _ { 7 0 } \mathrm { C u } _ { 3 0 }$ alloy was prepared by induction melting and crushed into powders with the size of $\sim 5 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ Then，the hot-pressed magnets were cut into pieces of $\Phi 1 0 \ \mathrm { \ m m } \ \times \ 1 \ \mathrm { \ m m }$ and were soaked into $\mathrm { N d } _ { 7 0 } \mathrm { C u } _ { 3 0 }$ alloy powders and treated at temperatures of $5 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ， $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，respectively. After diffusion treatment, small cylinders of $\Phi ^ { 3 } \ \mathrm { m m } \ \times \ 1 \ \mathrm { m m }$ were prepared for magnetic measurements.The coercivity of the initial and diffusionprocessed magnets was measured by magnetic properties measurement system. The microstructures were investigated bybackscatteringelectron(BSE） scanningelectron microscopy (SEM).High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR/TEM) was utilized to make observations of the detailed microstructure of the magnets.

# II.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fig.1 shows the demagnetization curves of the initial and NdCu alloy diffused HDDR hot-pressing magnets with different processing temperatures of $5 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ ： $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，respectively. The coercivity of the magnet without diffusion treatment is $1 5 . 4 \mathrm { ~ k O e }$ and gradually increases to 16.4,17.5,and $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { k O e }$ with the increase of diffusion temperatures. The remanent magnetization of the magnets diminishes unremarkably when processed at $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ while an apparent reduction of remanence occurred at a higher diffusion temperature of $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，The influence of the microstructure on the coercivity as well as the remanent magnetization is analyzed further in the following paragraph.

Fig.2 shows the coercivity versus temperature plots of the initial and the $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ diffusion treated HDDR magnets. The temperature coefficient $( \beta )$ of the coercivity for the two samples is $- 0 . 5 4 9 \% / \mathrm { K }$ and $- 0 . 5 1 9 \% / \mathrm { K }$ ，indicating an improvement of $\beta$ during diffusion process.It is relatively comparable with the typical value for commercial NdFeB sintered magnets with a temperature coefficient of about $- 0 . 6 \% / \mathrm { K }$ [6].

The BSE SEM images of the initial, $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ diffusion treated HDDR hot-pressed magnets are shown in Fig.3.There is no distinct bright contrast between the grain boundarylayers and ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains in most parts within the initial magnet except for the regions close to the agglomeration of Nd-rich phase [Fig.3(d)]. This agglomeration originates from the microstructure of the starting alloy before HDDR processing progress.The Nd-rich phase here was considered as the Nd source for the development of the grain boundary phase of the HDDR powders,which generated mobile Nd-rich liquid during DR step [7]. So,only the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains near the agglomeration regions [Fig.3(a)] are enclosed by the Nd enriched phases without NdCu diffusion treatment, which leads to relatively low coercivity.After the diffusion processing of $\mathrm { N d C u }$ eutectic alloy into the HDDR hot-pressing magnet at $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and ${ 7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C }$ ，the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains are separated uniformly by the Nd-rich phases as observed in Fig.3(b) and(c),both in the agglomeration and other regions [Fig.3(e) and (f)]. The coercivity improvement from 15.4 to $1 7 . 8 ~ \mathrm { k O e }$ probably stems from enhanced pinning effect of the boundary layer between the matrix phase grains owing to the Nd enriched boundary phases [8]. It should be noticed that the fraction of Nd-rich phase area in $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ diffused magnet is significantly larger than that of the $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ diffused one which presents less Nd-rich phases at ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grain junctions in most parts of the magnets.This is considered to be the contribution to significant decrease on the remanent magnetization between $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ diffused magnets.

Fig.4(a) and (b) shows TEM images of the initial and ${ 7 0 0 } ^ { \mathrm { ~ \circ ~ } } \mathrm { C }$ diffusion processed HDDR hot-pressed magnets, respectively. The average size of the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains was both from 230 to $5 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ , indicating no distinct grain size growth during the diffusion process.Without diffusion,the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains are connected directly with the neighboring ones due to the lack of Nd-rich phase,which was ascribed to the agglomeration of the Nd enriched region occurred in the HDDR processing.Fig. 4(c) shows the HRTEM image of the corresponding Fig. 4(a),demonstrating that extremely thin grain boundary layer existed before the NdCu alloy diffusion treatment, resulting in some exchange coupling between neighboring grains,which limits the coercivity. The grain boundary layer seems to be amorphous with a thickness of nearly $1 \mathrm { n m }$ which was similar to sintered magnets according to a previous report [9]. Besides,such thin layer may not be adequate to reduce or remove defects at the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grain interface. When the $7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ diffusion process was applied to the HDDR hot-pressed magnets,distinct and thick Nd-rich grain boundary phases formed as well as plenty of Nd enriched phases in the junction parts of adjacent grains.The thickness of the boundarylayersreached $2 \mathrm { - } 3 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ smoothly to decouple the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains with respect to magnetic exchange interaction and therefore increase the coercivity of the processed HDDR hot-pressed magnet. According to the expression of the ferromagnetic exchange coupling length $( L _ { \mathrm { e x } } )$ in hard magnetic materials, i.e., $\bar { L _ { \mathrm { e x } } } = \bar { ( A / K ) ^ { 1 / 2 } }$ , where $A$ is the exchange stiffness and $K$ is the anisotropy constant, the ferromagnetic exchange length $( L _ { \mathrm { e x } } )$ of ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ of $1 . 3 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ and the domain wall width $( \pi L _ { \mathrm { e x } } )$ of $4 . 1 \ \mathrm { n m }$ can be given by introducing the intrinsic magnetic parameters $( A = 7 . 7 \times \mathrm { ~ \dot { ~ } { 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } } ~ J m ^ { - 1 } }$ $K \ = \ 4 . 3 \ \mathrm { M J m ^ { - 1 } } .$ ）of ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ [9].A thickness of the grain boundary between the two values may either decouple the exchange interactions or pin the magnetic domain walls to improve the coercivity. The junction part, also making a contribution to the coercivity enhancement [1O],showed amorphous characteristic at the interface to the ${ \bf N d } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } _ { 1 4 } { \bf B }$ grains, which is regarded different to that in the case of crystalline Nd-rich phase present between the grains for sintered magnets.

# IV. CONCLUSION

The coercivity of the HDDR hot-pressed NdFeB magnets can be improved from 15.4 to $1 7 . 8 \mathrm { k O e }$ by means of diffusion treatment of an NdCu eutectic alloy. The influence of the microstructures of such magnets on the coercivity has been investigated.As a result, the Nd-rich grain boundary phase plays an important role not only by enhancing the pinning effect,but also by decoupling of the exchange interactions between the neighboring grains. Further optimization of the microstructures will be continued for better magnetic properties of HDDR magnets in the future.
