UA contrast and a greater spectral dispersion [1]-[5].At the frequency of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { M H z }$ (Larmor frequency of proton at $7 ~ \mathrm { T }$ or higher, it is technically challenging to design large-sized head coil [6]-[1O] as the wavelength in biological tissue is significant shortened [11]-[13].Transmit/receive (transceive）arrays have proved to be a popular choice for radio frequency (RF) coil designatultrahigh fields[14]-[2O],providing the capability ofRF shimming,parallel transmission $( \mathrm { p T x } )$ [21]-[23],and parallel imaging [24]-[27].

Transceive arrays using the microstrip transmission line (MTL）technology have been advocated for ultrahigh field MRI due to the improved resonance stability,reduced radiation losses,and a simple structure [7]-[1O],[16],[28]-[37]. However, the image coverage along the coil axis ( $\zeta$ -direction) is limited because of the length constrains of regular open-ended MTL resonators at ultrahigh fields,and the reduced $B _ { 1 }$ field near the ends of the resonators [8],[38],making usable $B _ { 1 }$ along the $z$ -direction often inadequate to cover entire human head. This problem could be addressed by using multiple-row MTL transceive arrays,which are able to provide enough longitudinal coverage by using regular or even shorter MTL elements. Withindependent transmit elements from different rows,the multiple-row MTL transceive array could offer the possibility of RF shimming and $\mathrm { p T x }$ along the $z$ -direction.The multiplerow design could also improve the parallel imaging performance due to the enlarged number of independent receive elements.

The main challenge in designing multiple-row MTL array is to attain sufficient electromagnetic (EM) decoupling among coil elements from adjacent rows.To ensure enough coverage along the $z$ -direction,coil elements from adjacent rows are usually tightlyplaced,resulting in strongly EM coupling.Although $L / C$ decoupling networks [28], [30],[31], [39] have been proposed and shown superior decoupling capability for adjacent elements from the same row,it may not be readily feasible for addressing the strong coupling between elements from adjacent rows.

In this study,we designed and constructed a 16-channel double-row MTL transceive array for human head MR imaging at $7 \mathrm { T } .$ A novel decoupling technique based on the induced current compensation (ICE) or a magnetic wall decoupling method [40]-[45] was employed to reduce the coupling between adjacent rows.To investigate the decoupling performance,transmission coefficient $( S _ { 2 1 } )$ plots and MR images of two-channel double-row MTL arrays with and without the proposed decoupling method were measured and compared.Bench tests and in vivo MR images of the 16-channel dual-row MTL array were obtained to demonstrate its feasibilityand performance in ultrahigh field MRI. Sagittal human head images and $\mathrm { g }$ -factorsof the double-row array were compared with those of a single-row arrayto evaluate the benefits offered by the double-row design. The multiple-row design has been applied for traditional $L / C$ loop arrays [18],[46]; however,no multiple-row MTL array has been reported to our knowledge.

# II.MATERIALSAND METHODS

# A. Two-Channel Double-Row MTL Array

In previous works,ICE decoupling has been successfully applied for MTL resonators [40]-[42], $L / C$ loops [43],and monopole antennas [45] to reduce the coupling between adjacent coil elements.In the literature [42], the mutual coupling between the coil element and decoupling element $( X ^ { c d } )$ has to satisfy acondition to achieve good decoupling performance.The space between two MTL resonators from adjacent rows is very limited and, thus,the decoupling element was placed closely nextto the coil elementsrather than inserted between them.

Each element in the two-channel double-row MTL array was manufactured from a Teflon bar of $9 \ \mathrm { c m } \ \times \ 4 \ \mathrm { c m } \ \times \ 1 . 5 \ \mathrm { c m }$ as shown in Fig.1(a) and (b).The distance between the two elements was $1 \mathrm { c m }$ ,and the total length of the double-row MTL array was $1 9 \mathrm { c m }$ .Byusing the double row or triple row design with Teflon substrate, the coil length or imaging coverage along the $z$ -direction can reach $6 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ ，given a maximum length of ${ \sim } 3 6 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ for a first harmonic microstrip.The ground was made from adhesive-backed copper foil with a width of $4 . 5 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ . The strip conductors were made of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ -wide copper tapes.For each MTL element,a trimmer capacitor Ct1 was terminated at the feed end for tuning and a fixed capacitor Ct2 (33pF, ATC Corp,Huntington Station,NY, USA) was terminated at the other end.To avoid the condition that the value of the matching capacitor was too small,a1.5-pF fixed capacitor and a trimmer capacitor $\mathrm { { C m } }$ connected in shunt were used for matching [47]. A resonator with two capacitors(Cd1 and Cd2) terminated at both ends and one variable capacitor(Cdt) terminated at the center was applied as the decoupling element.

The reflection coefficient $( S _ { 1 1 } )$ and transmission coefficient $( S _ { 2 1 } )$ of the two elements with and without the decoupling element were performed using an Agilent E5O71C network analyzer. To assure the performance of the proposed decoupling method,a pattern comparison ofMR images ona cylindrical water phantom acquired with:1) a single-coil element without the other element; 2) one coil element of the coupled two-channel array; and 3) one coil element of the well-decoupled two-channel array;wasperformed usinga gradient recalled echo(GRE) sequence with identical parameters.The parameters of the GRE sequence used were flip angle $( \mathrm { F A } ) = 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ ， $\mathrm { T R } = 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ ，TE $= 1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ , field of view $\mathrm { ( F O V ) } = 2 1 0 \times 2 1 0 \mathrm { \ m m } ^ { 2 }$ , matrix $\ l =$ $2 5 6 \times 2 5 6$ ,slice thickness $= 3 \mathrm { m m }$ ,bandwidth $= 3 2 0 \mathrm { H z }$ pixel. During the experiments, the cylindrical water phantom (length $3 7 \mathrm { c m }$ ,diameter $1 6 \mathrm { c m }$ ）wasplaced $3 \mathrm { c m }$ below the coil arrays. The EM parameters of the water phantom were measured by a dielectric probe (DAK-12, SPEAG, Switzerland): conductivity $\sigma = 0 . 5 9 \ : \mathrm { S / m }$ ； relative permittivity $\varepsilon _ { r } = 7 8$

# B. 16-Channel Double-Row Array for Human Head Imaging

The 16-channel double-row human head array consists of eight two-channel blocks as described above.All coil elements were mounted on an acrylic former with an outer diameter of $2 5 \ \mathrm { c m }$ .Fig.2(a) shows the constructed coil array and Fig.2(b) presents the element numbering.

MTL resonators have demonstrated better decoupling performance over $L / C$ loop resonators owing to their confined EM field.Therefore,no extra decoupling method was employed for coil elements from the same row in this study.All coil elements were matched to $5 0 \Omega$ and tuned to $2 9 7 . 2 \mathrm { M H z }$ ,which was the Larmor frequency of the unitized 7-T MRI system.Shielded cable traps were employed to avoid possible“cable resonance."

The scattering(S-) parameter matrix of the 16-channel array loaded withahuman head wasmeasured with the network analyzer. When any two elements were measured,all other coil elements were terminated with $5 0 \ – \Omega$ loads. The $S _ { 1 1 }$ plots were also used to calculate $\boldsymbol { Q }$ values. Our RF interface can only operate eight channels,with an eight-way power splitter, eight transmit/receive,switches and eight $5 0 \mathrm { - } \Omega$ preamplifiers.To test this 16-channel array, scans were conducted two times.The size of the human head used in this study is about $1 6 \mathrm { c m }$ in diameter, while the diameter of the coil achieves $2 5 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ .Phase adjustment is not required when the dimension of the coil array is large compared with the sample size [34]. Therefore,the phase increment between adjacent channels was set with $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ during each scan.Meanwhile,the unused channels were terminated with $5 0 \ – \Omega$ loads to eliminate unwanted RF power reflection. During the two scans,the positioning of a subject was carefully kept unchanged via the line markers made on the patient table.

GRE images on a healthy human head were obtained using the 16-channel dual-row array coil. The sequence parameters were set as follows: $\mathrm { F A } = 2 5 ^ { \circ }$ P $\mathrm { T R } = 1 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ 5 $\mathrm { T E } = 1 0 \mathrm { m s }$ ,FOV $= 2 1 0 \times 2 1 0 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ ,matrix $= 2 5 6 \times 2 5 6$ ,slice thickness $= 5 \mathrm { { m m } }$ number of excitation $( \mathrm { N E X } ) = 1$ ,bandwidth $= 3 2 0 ~ \mathrm { H z / p i x e l }$ To further evaluate the improved imaging coverage for human head, the obtained sagittal image was also compared with that of a regular single-row eight-channel array coil.

Accelerated GRE images with the reduction factor $( R )$ of2, 3,and 4 were acquired and analyzed to investigate the parallel imaging capability of the 16-channel array structure. The double-rowarray had alarger number of receive elements,and should have better parallel imaging performance over the regular single-row array.To validate this assumption, $\mathbf { g }$ -factor results with accelerations in the anterior-posterior(AP) direction of the 16-channel and eight-channel arrays were measured, calculated,and compared.All MRI experiments were performed on a whole-bodyMRI scanner(7TMAGNETOM,SiemensHealthcare,Erlangen,Germany).The human MRI experimental protocol was approved by the local Institutional Review Board,and the volunteers signed an informed consent form before MRI experiments.Before human head MR imaging,we performed safety test by measuring the temperature of a piece of $7 { \cdot } \mathrm { k g }$ pork for an hour using the same GRE sequence.The measurement was conducted with an Opsens fiber optic thermometer (Quebec,Canada).We placed four fiber optic sensors separately at shallow and deep regions of the pork meat,and changed the positions for repeated measurements after half hour. The temperature stayed between $2 1 . 1 ^ { \circ }$ and $2 1 . 2 ^ { \circ }$ at all selected points, and no“local hot spots”were observed during experiments.

# III.RESULTS

# A.Bench Test Results and Phantom Imagesof the Two-channel Double-Row Array

Fig.3(a) and (b) shows the $S _ { 1 1 }$ and $S _ { 2 1 }$ plots of the two MTL elements without decoupling treatments. It is clear that the two elements were strongly coupled ( $\mathrm { \Delta } S _ { 2 1 } = - 7 . 9$ dB)and the resonant peak was obviously split.By using the ICE decoupling method,the isolation was improved to $- 2 5 . 3 \mathrm { d B }$ and no resonant peak splitting was observed (see Fig. 3(c) and (d), indicating the sufficient decoupling capability of the proposed decoupling method.

Fig. 4 shows the water phantom images acquired from (a)individual elements,(b) elements from the coupled array, and (c) elements from the ICE-decoupled array.Partof the MR signals was obviously transferred to the other coil element when no decoupling treatments were used,as shown in Fig. 4(b), whereas the MR images from the ICE-decoupled array [see Fig. 4(c)] showed great similarity with the images from individual elements [see Fig.4(a)]. This indicated that the proposed decoupling method could effectively reduce the strong coupling to a sufficient small value,which also validated the S-parameter results shown above.

# B. Bench Test Result of the 16-Channel Dual-Row MTL array

Fig.5 shows the $S$ -parameter matrix and noise covariance matrix of the 16-channel double-row MTL transceive array loaded witha healthy human head.The coil numbering in Fig.5 corresponds to that shown in Fig. 1(b). $S _ { 1 1 }$ of each coil element was better than $- 2 4 ~ \mathrm { d B }$ ,indicating all coil elements were well matched to $5 0 \ \Omega$ .With the proposed ICE decoupling method, the isolation between two adjacent elements from different rows was better than $- 2 0 ~ \mathrm { d B }$ . As expected, the isolation among any two elements of the same row was better than $^ { - 1 9 }$ dB even that no extra decoupling treatments were employed. The worst case and average isolation among any two elements of the 16-channel array were $- 1 8 . 1$ and $- 2 6 . 7 ~ \mathrm { D b }$ ,respectively. The noise covariance results [see Fig. 5(b)] was in agreement with the $S$ -parameter results.Given that MR experiments were conducted using the two rows separately (each row one time), the covariance between elements from different rows was almost O. The unloaded $\boldsymbol { Q }$ of each coil element was approximately 221. The $\boldsymbol { Q }$ value loaded with the human head varied from 92 to 134 due to the different element-sample distance.

# C.Transmit Field Profiles,HumanHead Images,and Parallel ImagingPerformance

Fig.6(a) shows the transmit field $( B _ { 1 } ^ { + } )$ maps in the transverse(upper panel) and sagittal (lower panel) planes obtained from each row of the double-row array. The $B _ { 1 } ^ { + }$ maps were calculated by a double-angle method[48] and scaled to angle. Experimental parameters are $\mathrm { T R } / \mathrm { T E } = 1 \mathrm { s } / 1 0$ ms, $\mathrm { F A } = 1 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $2 0 ^ { \circ }$ ， $\mathrm { F O V } = 2 1 0 \times 2 1 0 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ ,matrix $= 1 2 8 \times 1 2 8 ~ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ slice thicknes: $\mathrm { \ s } = 5 \mathrm { \ m m }$ ,bandwidth $= 3 2 0 \mathrm { H z }$ .Each row of the double-row array is a standard MTL coil array and demonstrates a typical MTL array property.For the standard single-row MTL arrays,their $B _ { 1 } ^ { + }$ map of each channel at $7 \mathrm { T }$ has been reported in[16]. The coil sensitivity profiles of individual element of the proposed double-row MTL array were acquired and presented in Fig. 6(b).As expected, the two rows have different $B _ { 1 } ^ { + }$ and coil sensitivity profiles,which might be advantageous for $B _ { 1 }$ shimming and the pTx technology.

Fig.7(a) and (b) shows the combined sagittal GRE images obtained using the proposed 16-channel double-row array and aregular eight-channel single-row array,respectively. The two arrays have the same length and the sequence parameters for MR imaging are exactly the same. The data of individual elements were combined with the sum of squares(SOS）method and without intensity correction.The double-row array,compared with the regular array, promises a larger imaging coverage, and expands the imaging area to the lower portion of the human head,as shown in the red boxes of Fig.7(a) and (b).

Fig. 8 shows a set of axial GRE images obtained by using each row of the 16-channel array and their combination.Itis clear that the signal sensitivity of the first row is high in the upper area of the human head,while very weak at the lower area,e.g.,cerebellum,brainstem,and upper spinal cord.With thehelp of the second row,16-channel double-row arrayhas the imaging capability of the whole human head. Concluded from the sensitivity profile of each coil element, these axial images have a higher signal sensitivity at peripheral regions and a relatively lower sensitivity in the central area.

Fig.9.Individual images from each coil element (right)and their combination with the SOS method (left) in the (a) transverse and (b) sagittal planes.

Individual images in the transverse and sagittal planes from each coil element and their combination with the SOS method are shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b). These images were reconstructed from raw data and without any postprocessing treatment.Each coil element has a diverse and independent sensitivity map,which is beneficial to enhancing the parallel imaging performance.

To evaluate the parallel imaging performance, sagittal images using the 16-channel array with the reduction rate $R$ of1 (no acceleration),2,3,and4,respectively are shown inFig.1O. The accelerated images were reconstructed with generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions(GRAPPA） using the PULSAR toolbox [49].In the reconstruction,18 autocalibration signal (ACS) lines were used for each reduced rate. The image quality is still acceptable when the reduction factor achieves 4.

To further present the improved parallel performance of the double-row design,the average,and maximum $\mathrm { g }$ -factorsin the sagittal plane using the 16-channel array were measured, calculated,and compared with those froma regular eight-channel array. These average and maximum g-factors with $R$ varying from 2 to 8 are listed in Table Iand plotted in Fig.11(a) and (b). G-factor maps of the two arrays with $R$ of 2, 3,4, and 5 were also shown in Fig.11(c).Based on these results, the proposed double-row design, compared with the regular single-row array, improved the $\mathrm { \bf { g } }$ -factors and, thus,parallel imaging performance in the AP direction,even that both arrays have the same numberof coil elements in this direction.Considering that there are two elements arranged in the $z$ -direction,the double-row design should also be capable of performing acceleration longitudinally,which is almost impossible for a single-row design. G-factors were calculated using an RF coil array design and analysis softwareMusaik(Speag,Switzerland).

# IV.DISCUSSION

In this study,a MTL transceive array using multiple-row design technique isproposed forultrahigh fieldMRI.This techniquehas beensuccessfully implemented bydesigningand testing a16-channel double-row transceive array for human head imaging at $7 ~ \mathrm { T } .$ To reduce the coupling between elements of adjacent rows,a novel decoupling method based on the ICE decoupling method was employed. Given the limited space between elements from adjacent rows,the decoupling element wasplaced closely next to the coil elements,instead of between them.This decoupling method has shown superior decoupling capability,improving the isolation of the two rows from $- 7 . 9$ dB (without decoupling treatments) to better than $- 1 8 ~ \mathrm { d B }$

A main challenge when designing large-sized RF coils at ultrahigh fields is the increased inductance which decreases the resonant frequency.With the proposed multiple-row design,a large imaging coverage was obtained meanwhile the length of each element was significantly shortened.The regular MTL resonator used in RFcoil designs is a first harmonic resonator. Its length for resonating at ${ 3 0 0 } \mathrm { M H z }$ ,the proton Larmor frequency at7 T,is approximately $3 6 \mathrm { c m }$ when using Teflon as the dielectric substrate.Byusing the double-row design,the array length could extend to more than $6 0 \mathrm { c m }$ ，which is sufficiently long for most MR applications in humans.

The double-row array has also shown better parallel imaging performance over the regular single-row array because the number of independent receiver elements was doubled.Byusing the proposed double-row technique, the average g-factor of sagittal human head images was improved from1.41 to 1.06 at the acceleration rate of 4. The parallel imaging performance could be further improved by increasing the number of rows.In addition, the multichannel multiple-row design provides the capability of performing RF shimming and $\mathrm { p T x }$ along the $z$ -direction besides the $x -$ and $y -$ directions.Thus it is advantageous in providing more homogeneous transmit field in the human head.By changing the capacitance distribution of coil elements from different rows,different transmit fields and receive sensitivity fields could be obtained [5O].Although in this study, the MTL array with only two rows was tested, the number of rows could extend to three or even more.The double-row MTL array presented here is easy to fabricate in practice,and very suitable for designing large-sized parallel arrays with large channel counts atultrahigh fields.

(c) $\mathrm { \bf { g } }$ -factor maps of the 16-channel (top row) and eight-channel (bottom row) arrays with $R = 2$ ,3,4,and 5,respectively. These results indicate that the double-row design could largely decrease the $\mathbf { g }$ factor and,thus,improve the parallel imaging performance.

# V.CONCLUSION

In summary, we proposed a multiple-row transmission line transceive array design for human MR imaging in this study. Itsfeasibilityhas been validatedthrough bench tests and in vivo MRI experiments at the ultrahigh field of $7 ~ \mathrm { T } .$ The EM isolation among any two elements achieved $- 1 8 { \mathrm { ~ d B } }$ or betterby using the ICE/magnetic wall decoupling method. Compared to the regular single-row MTL array, the double-row array provided larger imaging coverage along the $z$ -direction and better parallel imaging performance,being able to image the whole human brain including the cerebrum,cerebellum,and brainstem.
