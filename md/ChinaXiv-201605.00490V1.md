# Summary

Eucalyptus are of tremendous economic importance being the most planted hardwoods Worldwide for pulp and paper,timber and bioenergy.The recent release of the Eucalyptus grandis genome sequence pointed out many new candidate genes potentially involved in secondary growth,wood formation or lineage-specific biosynthetic pathways.Their functional characterization is,however, hindered by the tedious,time-consuming and ineficient transformation systems available hitherto for eucalypts.To overcome this limitation,we developed a fast,reliable and eficient protocol to obtain and easily detect co-transformed E.grandis hairy roots using fluorescent markers,with an average efficiency of $6 2 \%$ .We set up conditions both to cultivate excised roots in vitro and to harden composite plants and verified that hairy root morphology and vascular system anatomy were similar to wild-type ones.We further demonstrated that co-transformed hairy roots are suitable for medium-throughput functional studies enabling,for instance,protein subcelllar localization,gene expression patterns through RT-qPCR and promoter expression,as wellas the modulation of endogenous gene expression. Down-regulation of the Eucalyptus cinnamoyl-CoA reductase1 (EgCCR1) gene, encoding a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis,led to transgenic roots with reduced lignin levels and thinner cell wals.This gene was used as a proof of concept to demonstrate that the function of genes involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis and wood formation can be elucidated in transgenic hairy roots using histochemical,transcriptomic and biochemical approaches.The method described here is timely because it willaccelerate gene mining of the genome for both basic research and industry purposes.

# Introduction

Because of their rapid growth rate，broad adaptability to diverse edaphoclimatic conditions and their multipurpose wood properties,Eucalyptus species are among the leading sources of woody biomass worldwide (Myburg et al.，2oo7;Paiva et al., 2011).Their considerable economic importance has recently increased because traditional interests in pulp and paper production have been extended to the emergent areas of biofuels and biomaterials.Wood is formed of secondary cell walls (SCWs) mainly constituted of cellulose,hemicelluloses and lignins.The composition and structure of the SCWs，relying among interactions between these biopolymers，are major determinantsofindustrial processingefficiencies(Holladay et al.,2007).

The huge economic importance of Eucalyptus wood has been a driving force to delineate the lignin pathway in this genus.More than 20 years ago，the gene encoding the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD),which catalyses the last step in monolignol biosynthesis，was cloned in Eucalyptus right after that from tobacco among all plant species (Grima-Pettenati et al.，1993). Thegene encoding cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR)，which catalyses the penultimate step in monolignol biosynthesis,was firstcloned in Eucalyptus(Lacombe et al.， 1997) and subsequently used to clone its orthologs in other plant species such as poplar (Leplé et al.，1998),maize (Pichon et al.，1998) and Arabidopsis (Lauvergeat et al.，20o1).Other SCW-related genes，including transcription factors，have been clonedin Eucalyptus but， due to the lack of an efficient stable transformation system,their functional characterization had been achieved mainly using heterologous systems such as poplar (Feuillet etal.，1995；Hawkinsetal.，1997;Lauvergeat etal., 2002；Legay et al.,2010; Samaj et al.，1998), tobacco (Goicoechea et al.，2005；Lacombe etal.，2000) and Arabidopsis (Baghdady et al.，2006; Creux et al.，20o8;Foucart et al., 2009;Hussey et al.,2011; Legay et al.,2010).

The recent availability of the Eucalyptus grandis genome (Myburg et al.,2014) hasallowed genome-widecharacterization of many gene families，notably those involved in the lignin biosynthetic pathway (Carocha et al.,2015)as well as transcription factor families containing members known to regulate SCW formation such as the R2R3-MYB (Soler et al.，2015)，NAC (Hussey et al.，2015)，ARF (Yu et al.，2014) and Aux/IAA (Yu et al.，2015）among others.These studies have underscored many new candidates potentially regulating wood formation that need to be functionally characterized.Although stable transformation protocols have been established for several Eucalyptus species (Girijashankar，2011;de la Torre et al.，2014;Tournier et al.，2oo3,and references therein),they are not suitable for medium-/high-throughput functional characterization of genes because they are tedious, time-consuming and present low efficiencies.For these reasons,only very few functional studies have been performed in transgenic Eucalyptus (reviewed in Girijashankar,2011).

Toovercome these limitations,we developed an alternative stable transformation system using Agrobacterium rhizogenes that allow rapid in vivo analysis of transgenes.A.rhizogenes,a soilborne Gram-negativebacterium discovered morethan 80 years ago (Riker et al.，193O)，induces the production of numerous secondary functional roots called ‘hairy roots' upon wounding and infection of many plants.This is the consequence of the stable integration and expression into the host cell of a TDNA encoding root locus (rol) genes caried on the root-inducing (Ri) plasmid (Chandra,2012;Chilton et al.,1982).If in addition to the Ri plasmid,A.rhizogenes harboursa binary vector,transgenic roots co-transformed with both the T-DNA from the Ri plasmid and the T-DNA from the binary vector can be obtained. A.rhizogenes-mediated root transformation has indeed been applied for a wide variety of purposes，ranging from studying nodulation,mycorrhization,interaction of plants with nematodes orpathogens，to the production of secondary metabolites, phytoremediation and rooting of recalcitrant species (reviewed in Christey，2001;Georgiev et al.，2012;Guillon et al.，2006). Transformed hairy roots can be in vitro cultured in axenic conditions to produce secondary metabolites or recombinant proteins among other applications,but the development of composite plants (wild-type shoots with transgenic roots) has been a key milestone for functional characterization of genes (Hansen et al.，1989).However，while hairy roots have been established in more than 100 species, the proportion of woody species transformed using this system is very low in comparison with annual plants (Christey，2Oo1).Besides，none of these studies fully explored the hairy root anatomy at the vascular tissue level,and whether the hairy roots are suitable to elucidate the function of genes involved in xylem or SCW formation is still an open question,particularly important for woody species.

In this article,we describe a fast,efficient and reproducible A.rhizogenes-mediated transformation protocol for E. grandis that allows the production of transgenic roots easily detectable by fluorescent markers.We show that Eucalyptus hairy roots are suitable for medium-throughput functional characterization of genes，enabling among others，protein subcellular localization, spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression and downregulation of endogenous genes. Last but not least,we demonstrate taking CCR down-regulation as a proof of concept that the function of genes involved in SCW biosynthesis and wood formation can be elucidated using histochemical,transcriptomic and biochemical approaches.

# Optimizationof A.rhizogenes-mediated transformation and generation of E. grandis composite plants

We first tested the hypervirulent A.rhizogenes strain A4RS previously shown to be the most effective in infecting other trees (Alpizar et al.，2006;Bosselut et al.，2011；Diouf et al.，1995; Gherbi et al.，2oo8)as well as in another Eucalyptus species, E.camaldulensis (Balasubramanian et al.，2011).We compared four protocols combining three types of E.grandis explants and three infection methods: (i) stabbing the hypocotyl or (ii) cutting and inoculating the base of the hypocotyl of14-day-old seedlings,(ii) cutting and inoculating the radicle apex of 3-dayold germinating seeds and (iv) stabbing the stem of an in vitro clonal line.The screening of the co-transformed hairy roots coexpressing both the T-DNA from the Ri plasmid and the T-DNA from a binary vector was performed using fluorescent markers (GFPor DsRed).The development time course of E.grandis transgenic hairy roots is described in Figure 1A.GFP or DsRed fluorescence was easily detected in calli neo-formed at wounding sites 7 days after infection and in emerging roots appearing in average 1-2 weeks later (Figures 1A and S1).Twenty-one days after infection was found to be the optimal time to calculate cotransformation efficiencies (Figure S1).

Co-transformation efficiencies were variable depending on the plant material and the infection protocol (Table 1).The eficiency of the hypocotyl stabbing protocol of 14-day-old E.grandis seedlings $6 2 \%$ in average,reaching up to $7 5 \%$ )was found tobe by far the highest.

Having selected the best inoculation system and starting plant material,we tested two other A.rhizogenes strains bearing pA4- type Ri plasmids (A4 and ARqua1)，known to elicit a limited number of Ri T-DNA-transformed roots with growthand morphology comparable to normal roots (Boisson-Dernier et al., 2001;Chabaud et al.,2006; Imanishi et al.,2011;Quandt et al., 1993).However, the infection of hypocotyls with ARqua1 led to transformation efficiencyof only $4 \%$ ，whereas no transformed hairy roots at all were obtained with A4 (Table 1).As it usually happens due to the inherent recalcitrance of woody plants,only the most virulent strain (A4RS) gave satisfactory co-transformationefficiencies (Alpizar et al.，2oo6).Therefore，all subsequent experiments were performed using the A4RS strain and the hypocotyl stabbing infection strategy following the protocol steps described in Figure 2.

One month after infection，the transgenic hairy roots were ramified and reached a size between 4 and 8 cm allowing excision ofa lateral root $2 c m$ long in average) for subsequent in vitro cultivation on solid media.The remaining fluorescent roots with the aerial part of the in vitro-grown composite plants were hardened for subsequent sampling and analyses (Figure 2f, g).Before hardening,we removed by cutting the nontransformed roots.All the composite plants survived the acclimation period and grew similarly to the nontransformed eucalypt plants. Although the length,thickness and branching of the composite E.grandis hairy roots were comparable to those of wild-type plant roots,one obvious difference was the presence of a high number of short and thin roots developing in the upper part of the hairy root system (Figure 2i).The fluorescence of either the GFPor the DsRed reporters was still easily detectable after 1.5 month (Figure 1B)and even after 1 year of growth.Notably, transgenic roots could restart growing after one to three sampling events when the older part (approximately one-third) of the root system was left on the composite plant and still express stably the fluorescent reporter gene.

# Construction of expression vectors for gene functional characterization and promoter activity analysis

Whereas the hairy roots expressing GFP were easily detectable under a fluorescent stereomicroscope， those expressing the DsRed were even easier to detect because there is no overlap between this fluorochrome and the natural autofluorescence of eucalyptus roots (Figure 1B)． For this reason，the Gatewayadapted binary vectors that we constructed for modulating gene expression (pGWAY-0，Figure S2）and/or enabling promoter studies (pGWAY-1,Figure S2) both contained the DsRed reporter gene.Using these new vectors,transformation efficiency dropped to $1 7 . 8 \%$ in average,which is lower than that obtained with the pHKN29 vector $6 2 \%$ inaverage).Estrada-Navarrete et a/. (2007) also reported that co-transformation efficiencies varywith different binary vectors.Both vector backbone and size are parameters that can affect co-transformation efficiency.The pGWAY-O and PGWAY-1 are bigger plasmids $( 1 7 . 5 ~ \mathsf { k b } )$ derived from a pBIN19 backbone,whereas the smaller pHKN29 $( 9 ~ \mathsf { k b } )$ is derived from a pCAMBlA 1300 backbone.

# In vitro hairy root cultures and subcellular localization of proteins

In order to determine the best culture conditions for excised transgenic hairy roots，we compared their growth curves in three solid media up to 2 months after excision (Figure S3).In the MER medium，the roots length increased slightly more than in the M medium and substantially more than in the MS medium，in which hairy roots virtually did not grow.Moreover,to demonstrate that E.grandis hairy roots can be used to study fluorescent-tagged proteins，we also used in vitrocultured roots transformed with a vector expressingan E.grandis histone linker (H1） fused to the Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP).As shown in Figure 3,in all root cells,the H1 protein was localized in the nucleus,consistent with its wellknown subcellular localization.

# Xylem structure from hairy roots

To evaluate whether transgenic hairy roots could be used as a proxy to explore the function of genes involved in xylem SCW formation，we compared the radial patterning and xylem anatomy of hairy roots relative to wild-type roots.The observations under light microscopy and under UV light (exciting the natural lignin autofluorescence) showed that the development of the xylem was similar between hairy roots and nontransformed roots when sampling at the same distance from the apex (Figure 4). At $5 ( m$ from the apex,primary xylem with four- to five-branch star pattern was observed in both types of roots (Figure 4a-d),whereasat $1 0 ~ \mathsf { c m }$ xylem exhibited a nearly circular shape,implicating that secondary growth started to occur with vascular cambium derived from the procambium producing secondary xylem (Figure 4e-h).At $2 0 ~ \mathsf { c m }$ ，secondary xylemand secondary phloem were clearly distinguishable (Figure 4i-l). In all stages,endodermis also fluoresced under UV light due to the presence of suberin.Both primary and secondary xylem developed in a similar way between transformed and nontransformed roots.

# Tissue and cell expression pattern of the EgCCR1 and EgCAD2 promoters in hairy roots

To validate that hairy roots were suitable to study the promoter activities of genes involved in xylem SCW formation，we produced independent transgenic hairy root lines expressing the reporter gene GUS under the control of the EgCCR1 or the EgCAD2 promoter.Both promoters conferred a preferential expression in the vascular cylinder of hairy roots (Figure 5a-c,i-j).A strong GUS activity was also observed in root tips (Figure 5b) and at the emergence of lateral roots (Figure 5c).As observed in cross-sections performed at $1 5 c m$ from the root in apex of composite plants (Figure 5e)，GUS staining was observed in xylem lignifying cells still having a cytoplasm，which possibly are developing vessels prior to autolysis or fibres.The EgCCR1 promoter was also expressed in paratracheal parenchyma cells located in vicinity of mature vessel elements that have already undergone autolysis and are not stained in blue.The paratracheal parenchyma cells are supposed to contribute to postmortem lignification of vessels (Baghdady et al.，2006;Pesquet et al.,2013).In older roots exhibiting clear secondary growth (Figure $5 \mathsf { f } _ { - 9 } )$ ，GUS activity wasalso shown in cambial cells and epidermis (Figure 5k).

# EgCCR1 silencingin hairyroots

To further confirm that hairy roots were suitable to study the function of genes involved in xylem SCW formation，we performed，as a proof of concept，down-regulation of cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (EgCCR1).We transformed the roots with an antisense EgCCR1 construct cloned into the pGWAY-0 vector containing a DsRed marker.Four empty vectors and 10 antisense EgCCR1 (CCRas) composite plants were hardened and analysed.Some of the CCRas hairy roots grew slower and showed a reduced size as compared to transgenic roots transformed with the empty vector,consistent with the reduced growth and size of the strongly EgCCR1 down-regulated tobacco plants (Piquemal et al., 1998).

Steady-state transcript levels of endogenous and antisense EgCCR1 RNAs were analysed by RT-qPCR in the younger parts (O$5 ( m$ from the apex) of the co-transformed roots.All the transformants tested expressed the antisense EgCCR1 transgene albeit to different levels (Figure S4).Three of nine CCRas lines (5- 1，13-2 and 3-1）showed a strong silencing of endogenous EgCCR1 mRNA with residual transcript levels lower than $1 7 \%$ of those of control lines. Four CCRas lines (16-1,5-2,3-2 and 16-3) expressed intermediate levels comprised between $5 3 \%$ and $2 8 \%$ of that of control lines (Figure 6a),whereas two lines (9-2 and

8-3)did not show endogenous EgCCR1 silencing.This variability in the extent of down-regulation of a target gene is frequently observed with the antisense strategy (Piquemal et al.，1998). Transcript-level analyses were not performed for line CCRas 5-3 because of the low quality of the RNA obtained,which could not be resampled and extracted a second time because the plant died after the first sampling.This is likely due to its very strong CCRas phenotype,as shown below.

Transcript levelsoffive lignin (EgPAL9，EgF5H1，EgF5H2, EgCAD2and EgCCR1),two cellulose (EgCesA1and EgCesA3)and two hemicellulose (EgGUX1 and EglRX7) biosynthetic genes were quantified in roots with eithera strong or an intermediate level of EgCCR1 silencing.All these genes are related to SCW biosynthesis (Carocha etal.，2015；Myburg et al.，2014)and，with the exception of EgF5H1,were expressed in young roots (Figure 6b). Among the analysed lignin-related genes,all but EgF5H2 showed a significant transcript-level reduction in CCRas roots，meaning that lignin biosynthesis was also repressed at transcriptional level. Moreover，some of the cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthetic genesanalysed were also repressed.Transcriptomic analyses performed in CCRas poplar plants also pointed out a reduced hemicellulose biosynthesis (Leplé et al.,2007).

thioacidolysis yield，expressed in μmoles $( H + G + S )$ per gram of extract-free sample,gives an estimate of the amount of parent ligninstructures. Consistent with their higher proportionof lignified cell walls,the older parts of the hairy roots gave rise to higher thioacidolysis yields that,in control lines,is2.8-fold higher than those from younger ones (Figure 8a,b). Differences between CCRas lines and controls were more obvious for older root fragments.When we normalized data together for the two kinds of roots used,thioacidolysis yields were significantly reduced in silenced lines $\cdot P < 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 8c). Interestingly，we also analysed by thioacidolysis samples from line CCRas 5-3 although we could not determine the extent of EgCCR1 down-regulation as mentioned above.This line showed not only a strong phenotype (stunted roots)，but also a lower thioacidolysis yieldlikely indicative of a lower lignin content.In addition,the percentage of G thioacidolysis monomers was reduced by $31 \%$ leadingto a higher $\mathsf { S } / \mathsf { G }$ ratio (Table S1),and more importantly, the marker compound for CCR deficiency $( G - C H R - C H R _ { 2 } ,$ with ${ \sf R } = \sf S e t )$ (Ralph et al.,20o8) was clearly observed on the corresponding GC-MS trace (Figure S5).

# Discussion

Here，we describe an efficient,versatile and rapid method to obtain and screen Eucalyptus transgenic hairy roots enabling medium-throughput functional gene characterization and gene function hypothesis testing.This homologous transformation system enables gene silencing,as shown for the EgCCR1 gene as a case study，and compensates the lack of mutant collections. Besides,it is worth noting that for the first time the EgCCR1 gene, cloned initially in Eucalyptus in 1997 (Lacombe et al.，1997)and studied since in many plant species (Leplé et al.，2o07；Mir Derikvand et al.，2008；Piquemal et al.，1998)，is functionally characterized in a Eucalyptus homolog system.

The down-regulation of EgCCR1 using an antisense construct led to a decrease in lignin content,an alteration of SCW structure and the presence of collapsed vessels as found in other species (Goujon et al.，2003； Jones et al.，2001；Leplé et al.，2007; Piquemal et al.，1998).Nearlyall the lignin-related geneswere down-regulated similarly to what was found in CCRas tobacco plants (Dauwe et al.，20o7),with the exception of the EgF5H2 gene. Because ferulic acid is known to accumulate in CCRas plants (Mir Derikvand et al.，2oo8)，one can hypothesize that EgF5H2 could be involved in detoxification processes via metabolizing ferulic acid into sinapic acid as suggested by Leplé et al. (2007) and Meyermans et al. (2000).

showed that xylem cell walls reacted faintly to phloroglucinol staining as compared to roots transformed with an empty vector (Figure 7a,b)，which appeared strongly stained in red.These observations were consistently made on several silenced lines further supporting a strong reduction in the lignin content as a consequence of EgCCR1 silencing.These roots observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed thinner cell walls and irregular shapes for bothxylem fibresand vessels (Figure $7 c -$ f).The structure of the SCW was strongly altered resulting in collapsed vessels.

Because of the low amount of available plant material, lignin evaluation was performed by thioacidolysis,a sensitive degradation method that specifically gives rise to $p$ -hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) monomers from H,G and S lignin units only involved in labile ether bonds (Méchin et al.,2014).The lignin-derived monomers were recovered from extractive-free samples prepared from the youngest parts of roots exhibiting only primary xylem as well as from more developed roots provided with secondary xylem.For each sample type，we analysed nonsilenced，medium and strongly silenced lines.The total

We further showed that the co-transformed hairy roots are a versatile system suitable for many applications,such as protein subcellular localization and analysis of promoter activity pattern. With that tool,we demonstrated that both the EgCCR1 and the EgCAD2 promoters conferred a preferential expression in the vascular cylinder of hairy roots.This result isin agreementwith previous studies performed with the same promoters in heterologous transformation systems such as poplar (Feuillet et al., 1995;Hawkins etal.,1997; Lauvergeat et al.,2002; Samaj et al., 1998)，grapevine (Lauvergeat et al.，2oo2)，tobacco (Lacombe et al.,2ooo;Lauvergeat et al.,20o2) and Arabidopsis (Baghdady et al.,2oo6),all showing vascular preferential expression in both stems and roots.Consistent also with these previous studies,a strong GUS activity was observed in root tips and at the emergence of lateral roots.GUS activity was also detected in cambial cells and epidermis of older roots as previously described in poplar (Hawkins et al.，1997; Lauvergeat et al.，2002； Samaj et al.，1998).These results confirm that the fine spatial and temporal dissection of these Eucalyptus promoters was accurately studied in heterologous plant systems,in line with the highly conserved network regulating SCW biosynthesis and deposition (Zhong et al.,201O). However,the expression patterns driven by theEucalyptus cellulose synthase (CesA） promoters showed differences between homologous (Eucalyptus) and heterologous (poplar) transformations (Creux et al.，2013),further supporting the importance of homologous transformation systems such as the one presented here.

Traditional Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated stable transformation and regeneration systems of Eucalyptus are long, tedious and low-efficient procedures (Girijashankar,2O11；de la Torre et al.,2014,and references therein). One major advantage touse A.rhizogenes-mediated transformation is the time needed to obtain material suitable for functional analyses，whichis considerably reduced.One month after infection，composite plants are ready to be hardened and root fragments can also be excisedto be cultivated in vitro.Transgenic roots from hardened composite plants developed secondary xylem similar to that of untransformed roots.In addition,after harvesting,hairy roots can restart growing from the remaining upper part (at least $1 5 c m$ ） providing biological replicates.Roots can also be excised from invitro composite plants and grown on solid medium to perform analysis in a more controlled environment.In addition,it is in theory possible to regenerate the whole plant from a transformed hairy root,as previously performed,for instance,for Allocasuarina verticillata (Phelep etal.,1991).

The Eucalyptus hairy root system developed in this study has also several advantages as compared to another alternative method called‘induced somatic sectoranalysis'or'ISSA', previously developed by Spokevicius et al. (2oo5)and Van Beveren et al. (2oo6) to overcome the low-efficiency and timeconsuming A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation and regeneration of Eucalyptus plants.Thismethodis based on A.tumefaciens transformation but restricted to wood sectors of stem fromactively growing trees,where the transgene is transferred into actively dividing cambial,xylem,phloem and ray initial cells. Being successfully applied in the analysis of transgenes in woody stem tissues of Pinus,Populus and Eucalyptus,ISSA can only be used to functionally characterize genes involved in the formation of vascular tissues and is particularly useful for promoter analyses (Creux et al.，2013;Hussey etal.，2011).In contrast, the hairy root system can be used for a vast panel of genes, thus being a more versatile system,with the only limitation that for obtaining the most accurate results,genes of interest should beexpressed in roots.Another important advantage of the transgenic hairy root system in comparison with ISSA is the quantity of transgenic material obtained.ISSA allows obtaining verylimited regionsoftransformed cellssurroundedby untransformed cells,thus making difficult the harvestingand analysis of transgenic wood. In contrast， transgenic hairy roots arehomogeneouslytransformed and easily detectedwith fluorescence and provide sufficient quantities of material for molecular biology，histochemical and biochemical approaches, as illustrated for the characterization of EgCCR1 down-regulated hairy roots.

To the best of our knowledge,less than a handful of studies were dedicated to Eucalyptus hairy roots.With the aim of improving the rooting capacities of some Eucalyptus clones,the early workof MacRaeand Van Staden (1993) had evaluated their susceptibility to several A.rhizogenes strains.Later on,a protocol for the generation of composite plants of E.camaldulensis using a GFP-based screening Was briefly described (Balasubramanian et al.，2O11)，but no functional gene characterization was achieved. In that study, $6 8 \%$ of plants showed root induction, but only $3 6 \%$ of those were co-transformed，resulting ina co-transformation efficiency of $2 5 \%$ .Using the same GFP-based vector (PHKN29),we obtained much higher co-transformation efficiencies $( 6 2 \% )$ ，while using the larger pGWAY vectors,the efficiencies were of the same order of magnitude of that obtained by Balasubramanian et al. (2011) with the small pHKN29 vector. Arecent study reported gene silencing in E.urograndis (E.gran$d \dot { I } S \times E .$ urophylla）hairy roots of STOP1，a transcription factor regulating aluminium and proton tolerance in plants (Sawaki et al.,2014),but the A.rhizogenes transformation method used was not detailed and surprisingly only referred to that of tobacco (Sawaki et al.,2013).

In conclusion,we demonstrated here the powerfulness of the hairyroots asahomologous，versatile，rapid and efficient transformation system enabling medium-throughput functional characterization of genes,especially those involved in xylem and SCW formation,which are of particular importance in woody plants.The development of such a tool that can be used easily and in routine is timely,because it will accelerate gene mining of therecently sequenced Eucalyptus genome for both basic research and industry purposes.Moreover,the composite plants as well as the excised roots open a whole range of new applications such as,for instance,the study of interactions with root pathogens and mycorrhizae.

# Experimental procedures

# Plantmaterial

Commercial E.grandis seeds (W.Hill ex Maiden，cultivar LCF A001）purchased at Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Florestais (IPEF，Piracicaba，Brazil) were surface-sterilized by 15-min treatment in a $1 \%$ sodium hypochlorite solution containing Twin-20. Germination was carried out on $\%$ strength Murashige and Skoog medium(MS medium；Sigma-Aldrich，St.Louis，MO)solidified with Phytagel $5 . 5 ~ { \mathrm { g / L } }$ (Sigma-Aldrich）at $2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ in the dark for 3 days. To obtain O.5- to 1-cm-long radicle，germination was performed at $2 5 ^ { \circ } C$ for3days in dark.We inverted the plates to allow the growth of the radicle towards the exterior of the media. To obtain in vitro plantlets around $8 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ long with the hypocotyls fully expanded and the first two leaves just appearing，we germinated seeds inside plates at normal position at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for 3 days in the dark followed by11 more days in light ( $\cdot 1 2 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } /$ s,8- to 16-h photoperiod, $50 \%$ humidity).We also used an inhouse E.grandis line obtained by invitro clonal propagation of one seedling，grown in M media (Tournier et al.，2oo3）for 3 weeks in conditions described above.

# Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains

Three strains of A.rhizogenes were tested: (i) the A4 agropine mannopine-type strain originally isolated from roses exhibiting hairy root symptoms (Moore et al.,1979),(ii) the A4RS strain,an A4-derived strain selected as resistantto the antibiotics rifampicin andspectinomycin (Jouanin et al.，1986)，and (ii) the low virulence ARqua1 strain,a Smr derivative ofA.rhizogenesstrain A4T (Boisson-Dernier et al.,2001;Quandt et al.,1993).

The binary vectors were introduced into A.rhizogenes strains byelectroporation(Nagel et al.，199O) and transformants selected on $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ kanamycin.Prior to infection,ARqua1,A4 and A4RS strains were grown for $7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $2 8 ^ { \circ } C$ in LB,2xYT and AG (Franche et al.,1997) solid media,respectively, supplemented withacetosyringone $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ and kanamycin $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ . In the case of A4RS strains,all media used were also supplemented with spectinomycin $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$

# Binary vector construction

Tooptimize the transformation protocol，we used pCAMBIAbased binary vectors expressing either the GFP (pHKN29,Kumagai and Kouchi，20o3） or the DsRed fluorescent proteins (pCAMBlA 2200-derived vector,Fliegmann et al.,2013),allowing easy detection of co-transformed hairy roots.

We constructed two Gateway-based binary vectors pGWAY-0 and pGWAY-1 (Figure S3) to overexpress genes of interest under the 35S CaMV promoter and to investigate promoter activities, respectively.The construction of the vectors is described in Figure S3 legend.The EgCCR1 cDNA (Lacombe etal.，1997),the EgCAD2 promoter (Feuillet et al.，1995)，the EgCCR1 promoter (Gago et al.,2011) and the histone linker protein (Eucgr.l02364) were amplified using primers listed in Table S2 and cloned into binary vectors as described in Appendix S1.

# Induction of hairy roots and generation of composite E.grandis plants

We tested four different transformation protocols using at least 30 plants for each.We removed the tip of the emerging radicle of 3-day-old seedlings and infected the wound surface as previously described (Boisson-Dernier et al.,20o1).We also inoculated 14- day-old seedlings by cutting and infecting the base of hypocotyls based on the work of (MacRae and Van Staden,1993).We finally used the hypocotyl-/stem-stabbing infection protocol as reported (Balasubramanian et al.,2011) using an infected $0 . 4 5 \mathrm { - } \mathsf { m m }$ -thick needle to inoculate 14-day-old seedlings and 3-week-old clonal lines of in vitro-grown $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { \Pi } } _ { E }$ ：grandis plantlets.

In all cases，co-culture was performed after infection for 14 days in MS with $\%$ strength of macroelements supplemented with $3 0 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathsf { L } }$ of sucrose and $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ acetosyringone,at $2 2 { - } 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ $40 \%$ humidity and under dim light $( 7 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { s } ,$ 8-to $1 6 - 1 7$ photoperiod conditions).Plants were further transferred on the same medium without acetosyringone and supplemented with $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid） to prevent agrobacteria growth (leamkhang and Chatchawankanphanich, 2005).Plants were grown in controlled conditions $( 1 2 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { s } ,$ （204号 8- to 16-h photoperiod, $40 \%$ humidity),and the screening for cotransformed hairy roots was performed 21 days after infection $( 2 1 \ \mathrm { d p i } )$ .GFP or DsRed fluorescence indicating co-transformed rootswas detected usinga stereomicroscope.Plants with at least one co-transformed root (containing both Ri and a binary vectors) were considered as positive.To calculate transformation efficiencies,about two to five independent transformation experiments were performed.

# Hardening of Eucalyptus composite plants

In order to obtain roots containing enough xylem，45-day-old composite plants were then cultivated in $2 0 0 - m L$ pots on Oil-Dri US-Special Substrate(Type Ill/R；Damolin，Fur，Denmark)ina phytotron $\langle 1 3 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / m } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { s } ,$ 8-to $1 6 - 1 =$ photoperiod, $2 5 - 2 2 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ $80 \%$ humidity).Plants were currently watered with tap waterand once a week using MS with $\%$ strength of macroelements solution．After 4-8 weeks，GFP or DsRed fluorescence was verified again.Fluorescent rootswere then sampled for RNA extraction (segments of the first five cm from root apex) and for biochemical analyses (many segments from 0 to $1 0 \ \mathsf { c m }$ from root apex for young material,ora single thick segment $1 0 \ \mathsf { c m }$ long from 20 to $3 0 ~ \mathsf { c m }$ from the main root for old material).Samples were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and further kept at $- 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ until analysis. Root segments (at least $2 0 \ c m$ from the root apex) were fixed with ethanol $80 \%$ for histology analyses or directly placed into GUS buffer (see below) for promoter activity analyses.After sampling，aerial part waspartially pruned to prevent imbalance between aerial and root parts,and plants were maintained in the phytotron.

# Hairy root cultures

Fluorescent root tips at least $2 ( m$ long were excised from in vitro composite plants at30 dpiand grown with augmentin on solid M media (Bécard and Fortin，1988) containing $3 \%$ Phytagel and subsequently subcultured in order to obtain clonal lines.Afterat least two transfers in M media,three media all supplemented with sucrose $3 0 ~ { \mathfrak { g } } / { \mathsf { L } }$ were tested to optimize root growth: (i) M media (Bécard and Fortin,1988),(ii) MS media with $\%$ strength of macroelements and (ii)MER media (modified M media by increasing $K N O _ { 3 }$ to a final concentration of $2 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ and by adding $N a H _ { 2 } P O _ { 4 }$ to $0 . 9 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ ).Elongation rate of rootswas studied by placing ten 2-cm tips of lateral roots belonging to four different transformation events on each medium for 60 days in Petri dishes.The linear elongation of each individual root was measured every10days.

# RNA extraction and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)

Wetested several segments of the rootsand several protocols of RNAextraction detailed in Appendix S2.The best RNA yield and quality were obtained using O- to 5-cm roots grinded by Fastprep (MP Biomedical,Santa Ana,CA) extracted with modifications of the protocol of Muoki et al. (2012) detailed in Appendix S2.

Remaining traces of DNA were removed with Turbo DNA-free DNase I (Ambion,Austin，TX)．RNA quality and quantity was checked with a Nanodrop ND-10o0 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,Waltham,MA).First-strand cDNA synthesiswas performed with $1 ~ \mu \ g$ of total RNA using High Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Applied Biosystems,Foster City, CA).RT-qPCR was performed in technical triplicate using ABl 79ooHT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).Relative transcript abundance was calculated using the $2 ^ { - \Delta \Delta \mathsf { C t } }$ method (Livak and Schmittgen,2001) with the housekeeping genes PP2A-1 and PP2A-3 to normalize data (Cassan-Wang et al.,2012) and the mean of the control samples to standardize results.

EgCCR1 transcript level was assessed using primers annealing at the $3 ^ { \prime } \cup \mathsf { T R }$ region,which do not amplify the EgCCR1antisense messenger,and primers hybridizing against the CDS region of the EgCCR1 gene, thus quantifying both the EgCCR1 gene and the EgCCR1 antisense mRNA levels (Table S3).We also measured relative transcript abundance for some genes involved in lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthesis,selected according to theirexpression pattern in Eucalyptus (Carocha et al.，2015; Myburg etal.，2014).Genes selected were EgPAL9，EgF5H1, EgF5H2 and EgCAD2 involved in the lignin biosynthetic pathway, EgCesA1 and EgCesA3 involved in cellulose biosynthesis，and EgFRA1/iRX7and EgGUX1 involved in hemicellulose biosynthesis. All primersare listed in Table S3.

# Biochemical lignin analyses

Young root samples from( $0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 0 ~ { \mathsf { c m } }$ from root apex) and old root samples (single thick segment $1 0 \ \mathsf { c m }$ long from 20 to $3 0 ~ \mathsf { c m }$ from the main root) were ground to a fine powder using a ball mill (MM4oo;Retsch,Haan,Germany).These samples were subjected to exhaustive water and then ethanol extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus.The recovered extract-free samples were dried at $4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ overnight before analysis by thioacidolysis as previously described (Méchin et al.,2014).

# Histochemical GUS assay

Histochemical GUS assay was based on the methods described by Hawkins et al. (1997).Briefly，transformed root sections were incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ in $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ sodium phosphate $( \mathsf { p H } = 7 . 0 )$ ， $1 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ EDTA， $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ ${ \sf K } _ { 3 } [ { \sf F e } ( { \sf C N } ) _ { 6 } ] ,$ $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ K4[Fe $( C N ) _ { 6 }]$ and $1 \mathsf { m m }$ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide $( X -$ Gluc;Euromedex，Souffel Weyersheim，France).Samples were further fixed using $3 . 7 \%$ formaldehyde, $5 \%$ acetic acid and $50 \%$ ethanol buffer.

# Microscopy and cell imaging

GFP or DsRed fluorescence indicating co-transformed roots was detected using a stereomicroscope Axiozoom V16 (Zeiss,Marly le Roi,France) equipped with a colour CCD camera (ICC5; Zeiss) and with filter sets for GFP $( 5 2 5 / 5 0 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ andforDsRed $( 6 0 7 / 8 0 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ 1 CFP fluorescence was analysed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP2-SE;Leica,Wetzlar,Germany).

Transverse sections( $5 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ thick)of roots embedded in $5 \%$ low gelling point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) were obtained using a vibratome (VT 1ooS；Leica)and observed using an inverted microscope (DM IRBE; Leica) equipped with a CDD colour camera (DFC30O FX;Leica)，or using the stereomicroscope.Lignified SCWs were visualized either in red by phloroglucinol-HCl staining or in blue due to autofluorescence under UV light.

Sections were also dehydrated in an ethanol series,submitted to a critical point dry with ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ asa transitional fluid using a CPD3o0 unit (Leica) and,once dried, coated with nickel $\langle 5 \ \mathsf { n m } \rangle$ in a EM MEDo2O coating system (Leica) and analysed using a scanning electron microscope (ESEM Quanta 25O FEG; FEl, Mérignac,France)at $5 ~ { \mathsf { K V } }$ ：
