This paper aims to investigate the synergistic effects of natural polysaccharides and inorganic nanoparticles on celladhesion and growth on intrinsically cell non-adhesive polyvinyl alcohol(PVA) hydrogels. Previously,we have demonstrated that $\mathsf { F e } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 }$ and hydroxyapatite (nHAP) nanoparticles are effective in increasing osteoblast growth on PVA hydrogels.Herein,we blended hyaluronicacid(HA)and chondroitin sulfate (CS),two important components of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM),with $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P / P V A }$ hydrogels.The presence of these natural polyelectrolytes dramatically increased the pore size and the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR)while maintaining excellent compressive strength of hydrogels.Chondrocytes were seeded and cultured on composite PVA hydrogels containing $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ,nHAP and $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ hybrids and $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ with HA or CS.Confocal laser scanning microscopy(CLSM) and cell counting kit-8(CCK-8)assay consistently confirmed that the addition of HA or CS promotes chondrocyte adhesion and growth on PVA and composite hydrogels.Particularly,the combination of HA and CS exhibited further promotion to cell adhesion and proliferation compared with any single polysaccharide.The results demonstrated thatthe magnetic composite nanoparticles and polysaccharides provided synergistic promotion to celladhesion and growth.Such polysaccharide-augmented composite hydrogels may have potentials in biomedical applications.

# 1.Introduction

Hydrogelsare biomimetic materials in terms of high water content,biocompatibility and biofunctionality and thus have been widely studied as promising candidates for tissue engineering [1]. Numerous natural [2] and synthetic hydrogels[3],ora combination of both [4],have been developed.Natural hydrogels usually possess excellent biocompatibilityand low toxicity,butwith poor strength and toughness [5]. Synthetic hydrogels are flexible in chemical structures,functionalities and mechanical strength and toughness, but could be limited by poor biocompatibility and biofunctionality [6].In order to fabricate scaffolds forload-bearing soft tissues,takingcartilage asan example,adequate mechanical properties have been recognized as important as the biocompatibility and biofunctionality [7,8].

Numerous strategies have been developed to create composite hydrogels with bioceramics or by blending natural and synthetic hydrogels in order to combine complementary properties to achieve ideal support to cell adhesion,proliferation and differentiation.

Polyvinyl alcohol(PVA）hasbeen widely investigated for biomedical applications [9-11] due to its merits including excellent biocompatibility，mechanical strength and toughness,low friction and high lubricity [12,13]. However,its intrinsically cell non-adhesive nature provides poor support to cell growth and integration to peripheral tissues[14,15].Modification of PVA with biomolecules such as arginine-glycine-asparticacid(RGD) peptide [16],hydroxyapatite[17]or natural polysaccharide(chondroitin sulfate) has shown improvements in cell adhesion and growth [18]. For example,hydroxyapatite(HAP)is the main inorganic composition in bone and has good osteoconductivity. The incorporation ofHAP into PVA hydrogel enhanced the MC3T3-E1 cell density with well spreading morphology[19]. On the contrary, iron oxide nanoparticles had little influence on chondrocyte phenotype,viability and the production of major cartilage matrix constituents [20,21]. The hybrid of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and hydroxyapatite had been demonstrated favorable to cell adhesion and proliferation on composite hydrogels.For instance,magnetic scaffolds (FeHA/collagen) were fabricated by doping $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + } / \mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ ions into HAP nanocrystals nucleated on self-assembling collagen fibers. Such a composite hydrogel provided better support to cell adhesion,distribution and proliferation than the control HA/collagen scaffolds[22]. Our previous studies also demonstrated promoted osteoblast adhesion and proliferation on $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { H A P } /$ PVAhydrogels than on HAP/PVA and PVA hydrogels [23].

In contrast,polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid(HA)and chondroitin sulfate (CS)are two important biomolecules in most tissues including cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM).Theyare critical for cell adhesion,differentiation,migration and tissue integration [24,25].Hydrogels based on HA and CS or their derivatives have been widely investigated as scaffolds to engineer or repair tissues including cartilage or osteochondral defects [26-28]. Interestingly,aldehyde-modified CS conjugated with amines could act as strong bio-adhesives to glue tissue interface in cartilage defect of rats[25].Moreover,a combination of HA and CS has been demonstrated to achieve better results of cell growth than single HA or CS.For instance,compared with hyaluronic acid/silk fibroin (HA/SF,2O/8O）(w/w）scaffolds,chondroitin sulfate/hyaluronic acid/silk fibroin $\left( \mathrm { C S } / \mathrm { H A } / \mathrm { S F } , 5 / 1 5 / 8 0 \right) \left( \mathrm { w } / \mathrm { w } / \mathrm { w } \right)$ scaffolds improved the angiogenesis and collagen production and promoted dermis regeneration [29].Despite of these advantages of polysaccharides in cell growth,extracellular matrix secretion and tissue repair, inadequate mechanical properties remain as major limits to applications in tissue engineering[3O].Itis desired to develop strong and tough hydrogels with excellent bioactivitiesand biofunctionalities for biomedical applications.

In this article,we combined polysaccharides (HA and CS) with previously reported strong and tough $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P / P V A }$ nanocomposite hydrogels in order to further enhance the biofunctionality of these hydrogels.HA,CS and a combination of both were incorporated into PVA hydrogels and nanocomposites prior to freeze-thawing.The morphology,swelling and mechanical properties of these composite hydrogels were investigated. Neat PVA hydrogels and those composited with $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ,nHAP and $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ hybrids were used for chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation study. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and cell counting kit-8(CCK-8）assay results demonstrated that an appropriate content of polysaccharides （HA） could significantly improve the adhesion and proliferation of cells.When single or combined polysaccharideswere incorporated into PVA hydrogels,the influence of chondrocyte adhesion and proliferationon PVA hydrogels was studied.Finally,the synergistic effect of polysaccharides and nanoparticles in promoting the adhesion and proliferation ofchondrocytes is discussed.

# 2.Materials and methods

# 2.1.Materials

Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA,degree of polymerization: $1 7 5 0 \pm 5 0$ analytical reagent, $\geq 9 9 . 0 \%$ was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.Hyaluronic acid sodium (HA, $M \mathrm { w } = 3 8 0 \mathrm { k D a }$ ） was obtained from Shan Dong Freda Biopharm Co.,Ltd. Chondroitin sulfate(CS) was obtained from Shaanxi Sciphar Natural Products Co.，Ltd. $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 2 } { \cdot } 4 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } 0$ $( \geq 9 9 . 0 \% )$ ， $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 } { \cdot } 6 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } 0$ $( \geq 9 9 . 0 \% )$ $\mathrm { C a } ( \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } { \cdot } 4 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ $( \geq 9 9 . 0 \% )$ ， $( \mathsf { N H } _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } \mathsf { H P O } _ { 4 }$ $( \geq 9 9 . 0 \% )$ and $\mathsf { N H } _ { 4 } \mathsf { O H }$ $( 2 5 . 0 \% )$ solutions were of analytical reagent grade (Aladdin Chemistry Co.,Ltd).All other chemicalsand solventswere of analytical reagent grade.

# 2.2.Preparation of nanocomposite hydrogels and magnetic nanocomposite hydrogels

Magnetic $\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / n H A P }$ nanoparticleswerepreparedas described previously [23].PVA was dissolved in deionized water with mechanical stirring at $9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $6 \mathrm { h }$ to yield a $3 . 3 \mathrm { w t } \%$ solution,which was then slowly cooled down to $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ HA and CS were separately dissolved in deionized water with magnetic stirring at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ to yield a $2 . 0 \mathrm { w t \% }$ solution.Subsequently, single(HA or CS) or combined(HA and CS）polysaccharide solutions were,respectively,added into PVA solution to fabricate polysaccharide/PVA(HA or CS was 5wt% to PVA) solutions.The solutions were then added dropwise into cell culture plates,followed by six freeze-thawing cycles to produce polysaccharide/PVA hydrogels (marked as HA/PVA,CS/PVA and HA/CS/PVA).The $\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / n H A P }$ nanoparticle suspension was added into the polymer solutions (PVA,HA/PVA,CS/PVAand HA/CS/PVA),with mechanical stirring to generate homogeneous dispersions,which were then added dropwise into cell culture plates.The sols were freezethawed six times to produce magnetic nanocomposite hydrogels (coded as PVA-M,HA/PVA-M,CS/PVA-M and HA/CS/PVA-M). In order to further identify the contribution of the $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ and nHAP nanoparticles on chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation, $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 } / { \sf P V } \sf A$ and nHAP/PVA nanocomposite hydrogels with $50 \mathrm { w t \% }$ ofnanoparticleswerealso fabricated.

# 2.3.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

The hydrogels were freeze-fractured in liquid nitrogen,and the fracture surface Was sputtered with gold before imaging by using a Hitachi TM-1ooO scanning electron microscope (SEM, Tokyo Japan).

# 2.4.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

The PVA-M hydrogels were freeze-dried and cut into thin $( \sim 5 0 \mathrm { n m } )$ slices at $- 6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ，The slices were collected on copper grids coated with ultra-thin carbon film for transmission electron microscopy investigation by using an FEI Tecnai F2O instrument (TEM,Oregon,USA) at $2 0 0 \mathrm { k V } .$ ：

# 2.5.Swelling behavior of hydrogels

The swelling behavior of hydrogels was assessed in deionized water at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The freeze-dried hydrogels $( n = 5 )$ with $8 \mathrm { m m }$ diameter and $4 \mathrm { m m }$ heightwithaweight $M _ { 0 }$ were used for the swelling experiments.The weight of swollen samples $M _ { \mathrm { t } }$ was traced until equilibrium.The swelling ratio was defined as the mass ratio of the net liquid uptake to the dry hydrogel:

# 2.6.Porositymeasurementsof hydrogels

The porosity was measured by using a water replacement method.The freeze-dried hydrogel was put into a cylinder container with $V _ { 0 }$ (mL)water,resulting ina total volume of $V _ { 1 }$ (mL). Thus,the volume occupied by the xerogel was $( V _ { 1 } - V _ { 0 } ) \mathrm { m L }$ After equilibrium swelling,the hydrogels were taken out of the cylinder container,leaving $V _ { 2 }$ (mL)water.Then, the pore volume of hydrogels was $( V _ { 0 } - V _ { 2 } ) \mathrm { m L }$ ,whereas the total volume ofhydrogels was $( V _ { 1 } - V _ { 2 } ) \mathrm { m L }$ . The porosity of hydrogels $( P )$ could be calculated as

$$
P ( \% ) = \left[ { \frac { ( V _ { 0 } - V _ { 2 } ) } { ( V _ { 1 } - V _ { 2 } ) } } \right] \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

# 2.7.Compressive tests of hydrogels

Cylindrical hydrogel samples (approximately $8 \mathrm { m m }$ in diameter and $4 { \mathrm { - } } 6 \mathrm { m m }$ height) were tested in unconfined compressive mode by using an Instron 5567 mechanical testing machine(Instron,MA, USA).Five samples were tested for each hydrogel $( n = 5 )$ . The samples were tested at $1 0 \%$ strain/min.The compression limit was set as $9 8 \%$ strain to protect the load cell.

# 2.8.In vitro cell culture with hydrogels

Human chondrocytes（CHON-001，ATCC? CRL-2846TM）were separately seeded on hydrogels to determine the cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors.Chondrocytes were grown in McCoy's 5A medium (Gibco), then supplemented with $10 \%$ fetal bovine serum, $1 0 0 \mathrm { U / m L }$ penicillin and $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ streptomycin under a humidifiedatmosphereof $9 5 \%$ airand $5 \% \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The culture medium was replaced twicea week.The cells were passaged bytrypsinization.Cells at passage3 were used for the experiments.

Hydrogels were cut into $8 \mathrm { m m }$ diameter circular discs and then sterilized by immersing in $7 5 \%$ ethanol and followed by washing in sterile PBS.The cells $( 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { c e l l s / m L } )$ were seeded to the hydrogels $( n = 3 )$ in 48-well plates (Corning).

After culturing for specific days,the hydrogels were removed from the culture media and washed three times with PBS and then fixed with $2 \%$ glutaraldehyde for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { h } }$ .The hydrogels were successively washed with PBS,soaked in $0 . 1 \%$ Triton X-100 for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and washed again with PBS.Subsequently,the chondrocytes on the hydrogelswereblocked with $1 \%$ bovine serum albumin(BSA) for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ,stained with $5 0 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m L }$ phalloidin-FITC(Invitrogen,St Louis, USA)solution for 1h at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and then washed with PBS several times to remove unbounded phalloidin conjugate.Then, $1 0 \mu \mathrm { g / m L }$ $^ { 4 ^ { \prime } , 6 }$ -diamidino-2-phenylindole(DAPI)(BestBio,Shanghai,China) wasaddedand incubated in darkat $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for 5 min. Then the samples were washed with PBS.Finally, the cytoskeleton and nucleus of chondrocytes were imaged by using a confocal laser scanning microscope(CLSM) (Leica TCS SP5 II, Braunschweig,Germany) or a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-51,Tokyo,Japan).

The chondrocytes on the hydrogels $\left( n = 5 \right)$ were quantitatively investigated by the CCK-8 assay after cultured for1,3,7and 15 days. After removal of the culture media from cell culture plates, $3 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ fresh culture media and $3 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ CCK-8 kit solutions were immediatelyadded and homogeneously mixed and then incubated for $6 \mathrm { h }$ in a ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ incubator.Finally, $2 0 0 \mu \mathrm { L }$ reaction solutions were put into 96-well plate.The optical density of each well at $4 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ was read bya microplate reader (SpectraMax19o,Molecular Devices,USA).

# 3.Resultsanddiscussion

# 3.1.Morphology and structures of hydrogels

The hydrogels showed typical interconnected porous structures,which is beneficial for the mass and nutrient transport.The pore size of PVA hydrogel was $7 . 6 \pm 2 . 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (Fig.1a).When the polysaccharides ( $. 5 \mathrm { w t \% }$ to PVA) were incorporated into PVA hydrogels,the pore size was increased gradually(Fig.1b-d). The pore sizes of CS/PVA $( 5 \% / 9 5 \%$ ,w/w) and HA/PVA $( 5 \% / 9 5 \%$ ,w/w) hydrogels were $3 1 . 6 \pm 4 . 0$ and $1 0 . 3 \pm 2 . 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .In addition,the pore size of HA/CS/PVA $( 5 \% / 5 \% / 9 0 \%$ ， $\nu / \nu / \nu )$ was $1 6 . 6 \pm 2 . 7 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ，which is between those for HA/PVA and CS/PVA hydrogels.With the presence of $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ nanoparticles ( $5 0 \mathrm { w t \% }$ to PVA), the pore size of PVA hydrogel was decreased to $5 . 2 \pm 1 . 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (Fig. 2a). The results were consistent with our former report [23].Previously, for the $\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / n H A P / P V }$ Ahydrogels,when the content of nanoparticles was 10,20 and $5 0 \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,the pore sizes were smaller than those of PVA hydrogels.During freeze-thawing,the porous structures were formed due to the phase separation between PVA and ice [13]. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ nanoparticles and PVA may form hydrogen bonds.Thus,the nanoparticles may serve as nuclei to ice,leading to the formation of small ice crystals, which results in small pores in the composite PVA hydrogels [31]. TEM images demonstrated that the rod-like $\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / n H A P }$ nanoparticleswere well distributed in the PVA hydrogels (Fig.2e),which is critical for the mechanical properties of the hydrogels.When polysaccharides were added into PVA-M hydrogels,the pore size was improved significantly (Fig.2b-d). The pore sizes ofHA/PVAM,CS/PVA-M and HA/CS/PVA-M were $8 . 7 \pm 2 . 0$ ， $3 3 . 8 \pm 6 . 9$ and $1 5 . 9 \pm 2 . 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .The CS had the highest influence on pore sizes for PVAhydrogels,whereas the HA polysaccharides showed less influences.The pore sizeofHA/CS/PVAhydrogelswas between that of HA/PVA and CS/PVA hydrogels.The porosity was measured at equilibrium swelling by using a water replacement method.The results (Supplementary Material,Fig.S1) showed that the incorporation of magnetic HAP nanoparticles into hydrogels reduced the porosity.

# 3.2. Swelling properties of hydrogels

The equilibrium swelling of PVA and PVA-M hydrogels was achieved by soaking in water for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ .Theequilibrium swelling ratio（ESR）ofPVA-M（ $5 0 \mathrm { w t \% }$ $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ nanoparticle with respect to PVA)( $3 0 5 . 3 \pm 1 0 . 4 \%$ was decreased in comparison to neatPVAhydrogels $( 3 6 5 . 7 \pm 2 2 . 4 \% )$ L

When 5wt% CS and/or HA was added into the PVA hydrogels. the swelling ratio was increased significantly(Fig.3a).The swelling ratioofCS/PVAhydrogelswasthehighest ( $1 1 2 9 . 3 \pm 1 0 1 . 8 \% )$ ,while that ofHA/PVAhydrogelswas thelowest $( 5 7 9 . 5 \pm 5 8 . 7 \% )$ andthe ESR of HA/CS/PVA hydrogels was in between $( 9 3 4 . 9 \pm 1 6 5 . 8 \% )$ Meanwhile,for PVA-M hydrogels,theadditionof polysaccharides also increased the swelling ratio significantly(Fig.3b).The swelling ratios of CS/PVA-M,HA/CS/PVA-Mand HA/PVA-Mhydrogelswere 6.1,2.3and 1.3 timesas those ofPVA-M hydrogels.Moreover, CS induced higher Water uptake in hydrogels than that of HA. The results may be attributed to the difference in osmotic pressures in these systems.The pH value of water solution was 7.0,which was higher than the pKa of CS(2.6) and HA(2.9)[32,33].Thus CS and HA molecules in hydrogels are ionized,with the ionic strength of CS higher than that of HA.As a result, the osmotic pressure in PVA hydrogels with CS is higher than that with HA,which drives a higher water uptake or ESR for the former than for the latter[34].

# 3.3.Mechanical properties of hydrogels

Fig.4showsrepresentativecompressiveengineering stress-strain curves and the compressive strengths of the hydrogels.The compressive strengths of PVA,HA/PVA $( 5 \% / 9 5 \%$ w/w), CS/PVA $( 5 \% / 9 5 \%$ ,w/w) and HA/CS/PVA $( 5 \% / 5 \% / 9 0 \%$ w/w/w) hydrogels were $0 . 3 \pm 0 . 1$ ， $0 . 8 \pm 0 . 3$ ， $1 . 1 \pm 0 . 4$ and $2 . 7 { \pm } 0 . 4 \mathrm { M P a }$ .When nanoparticles were blended into PVA hydrogels,the compressive strength was increased significantly.For example,the compressive strength of PVA-M( $5 0 \mathrm { w t \% }$ $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ nanoparticles）was $2 9 . 8 \pm 7 . 3 \mathrm { M P a }$ .For the nanoparticles/PVA composite hydrogels, the addition of polysaccharides increased the mechanical properties slightly.The compressive strengths ofHA/PVA-M,CS/PVA-M and HA/CS/PVA-M were $2 5 . 8 \pm 2 . 5$ $2 8 . 6 \pm 1 . 5$ and $3 4 . 6 \pm 7 . 1$ MPa, respectively(Fig.4b).These results showed that the nanoparticles played dominant roles in improving the mechanical properties of PVA hydrogels.

# 3.4.The influence of $F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ,nHAPand $F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / n H A P$ nanoparticles onchondrocyte adhesionand proliferationonPVA hydrogels

In our previous study, $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ,nHAP and $\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / n H A P }$ nanoparticles have been demonstrated to enhance osteoblast adhesion and growth on PVA hydrogels [23].Herein,we further investigate the effect of these nanoparticles on chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation on PVA-based hydrogels.After culturing with chondrocytes for2,5 and 9 days,SEM and fluorescent microscopy were used to evaluate the cell morphology,adhesionand proliferationbehaviors. Asshown in Supplementary Material,Figs.S2and S3,there were few chondrocytes on PVA hydrogels,and the chondrocytes did not proliferate over time.In contrast,chondrocytes nicelyadhered and grew on $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 } / { \sf P V } \sf A$ hydrogels.Moreover,the chondrocyte density on thePVA-Mhydrogel was higher than thatonnHAP/PVA hydrogels and less than that on $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 } / { \sf P V } \sf R$ hydrogels.In the following study, $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ composite nanoparticles were used as model nanoparticles to composite with PVA hydrogels.

# 3.5.1.The influence of HA content on chondrocyte adhesion and proliferationonPVA hydrogels

Hyaluronic acid (HA)isa linear high molecular weight polysaccharide and the backbone of glycosaminoglycan(GAG）and has been demonstrated to regulate cell adhesion,proliferation and differentiation.Moreover,HA plays a very important role in lubricating the moving surface of knees [35].Herein,HA was used to promote the cell adhesion and proliferation on PVA hydrogels.

PVA hydrogels containing $5 \%$ ， $1 0 \%$ and $2 5 \%$ (w/w）HA, denotedas 5HA/PVA,10HA/PVAand 25HA/PVA,were seeded with chondrocytesand cultured for1,3,7and 15 days.Fig.5 shows the

CLSM images of the chondrocytes.There were few chondrocytes on PVAhydrogelsat day1and no obvious chondrocyte proliferation from3 to 15 days(Fig.5a-d),which indicates that PVAhydrogels are not conducive to cell adhesion and proliferation.When $5 \%$ HA was added into PVA hydrogels,the chondrocyte densities on 5HA/PVA hydrogels were increased significantly in 7and 15 days.However, the adhesion and proliferation of chondrocytes on 1OHA/PVAand 25HA/PVA hydrogelswere not different from those on PVAhydrogels.

Incontrast, the cell proliferation for1，3，7 and 15 days was also studied by using CCK-8 assay (Fig.6).The resultsshowedthattheproliferationofchondrocytes was the best on 5HA/PVA hydrogels. When the HA content was increased to $10 \%$ and $2 5 \%$ ，the cell adhesion and proliferation on HA/PVA hydrogels were no better than those on PVA hydrogels.The results of CCK-8 assay were consistent with the fluorescent observations (Fig.6). Some studies demonstrated that the influence of HA on secreting cartilage extracellular matrix appeared dose-dependent.As the hyaluronic acid (HA) was added into poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate(PEGDM) and collagen typeIhydrogels,the low content HA $( 0 . 5 \% , \mathrm { w / w } )$ -basedhydrogels had better results in increasing ECM production than that of high content HA ( $1 . 0 \%$ ,w/w)-based hydrogels [36].Allemann et al. [37] prepared HA/collagen scaffolds with the content of HA of 2,5,10 and $14 \%$ w/wand seeded with chondrocytes.After7days culture, the chondrocytes in $2 \% \mathrm { H A }$ /collagen scaffolds expressed more ECM than those in $1 0 \%$ HA/collagen scaffolds.Moreover,Akmal etal.[38] evaluated the effects of HA on chondrocytes.Compared with high concentrations of HA(2.0 and $3 . 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ),thelowconcentrations of HA (0.1 and $1 . 0 \mathrm { m g / m L }$ )considerablypromoted the expression of DNA,sulfated glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline synthesis. In our study, the low content of HA $( 5 \% )$ wasmore beneficial for cell growth than the high content ofHA( $1 0 \%$ and $2 5 \%$ ).Ourresults were consistent with those in the literature.

It is noted that,in contrast to the influence of HA content on chondrocyte adhesion and growth, the CS content (2,11 and $2 5 \mathrm { w t \% } )$ showed no obvious promotion of chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation in comparison to PVA(Supplementary Material, Fig. S4).Therefore,for the following studies,the CS content was used as $5 \mathrm { w t \% }$ to match the optimal HA content of $5 \mathrm { w t \% }$

# 3.5.2.The impactof single and complex polysaccharides for chondrocyte adhesion and proliferationon PVA

Hyaluronic acid（HA）and chondroitin sulfate(CS）are the main components of cartilage ECM.The CS was connected to the backbone of HA.In order to create biomimetic environment,HA $( 5 \mathrm { w t \% } )$ ,CS(5wt%) and HA $( 5 \mathrm { w t \% } ) / \mathrm { C S } \left( 5 \mathrm { w t \% } \right)$ polysaccharideswere introduced into PVA hydrogels,which were seeded and cultured with chondrocytes.After culture for 3,7 and 15 days (Fig.7), thenumber densities of chondrocytes on the HA/PVAand CS/PVA hydrogels were higher than those on the PVA hydrogel.When HA and CS were co-mixed into PVAhydrogels,the chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation on HA/CS/PVA hydrogels were improved in comparison to those on HA/PVA or CS/PVA hydrogels (Fig.7).These results showed that the co-existence of CS and HA showed better effects on chondrocyte growth than the single HA or CS biopolymers.

Similar synergistic effect of CS and HA was reported by Kaplan and co-workers [29] who fabricated silk fibroin (SF)/chondroitin sulfate(CS)/hyaluronic acid(HA) ternary scaffolds by freeze-drying. The SF,SF/HA and SF/CS/HA scaffolds were implanted onto dorsal full-thickness wounds of rats.Compared with SF and SF/HA scaffolds,the SF/CS/HA scaffolds accelerated dermisregeneration, angiogenesis and collagen deposition.In promoting dermal tissue regeneration,the polysaccharides (CS/HA) were better than single polysaccharide (HA). Itis concluded thatHA or CS polysaccharides could improve cell adhesionand proliferationability on PVA hydrogels.Moreover,combined these two kinds of polysaccharides had superiority in increasingcell growth behaviors in contrast to single polysaccharides (HA or CS).

# 3.5.3.The synergistic effects of nanoparticles and polysaccharides inincreasingchondrocyte growth

With the presence of nanoparticles,the chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation on PVA-M hydrogels were enhanced in comparison to PVA hydrogels (Fig.8a and e). In contrast, the chondrocyte growth was also enhanced on HA/PVA,CS/PVA and HA/CS/PVA hydrogels (Fig.8b-d). The nanoparticles and polysaccharides played key roles in increasing chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation.It would be interesting to further investigate the combined effects of nanoparticles and polysaccharides on promoting chondrocyte growth.When HAand $\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } / n H A P }$ nanoparticles were simultaneously added into PVA hydrogels,chondrocyte possessed preferential adhesionand proliferationability on HA/PVA-M hydrogels in comparisonto HA/PVA,PVA-M and PVA hydrogels. Besides,compared with CS/PVA,PVA-Mand PVAhydrogels,the chondrocytes preferred to grow on CS/PVA-Mhydrogels.Moreover, there was best chondrocyte adhesion on HA/CS/PVA-M hydrogels compared with HA/PVA-M and CS/PVA-M hydrogels.Thus, when the polysaccharides（HA,CS or HA/CS）and $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { n H A P }$ nanoparticles were added into PVA hydrogels,theadhesion and proliferation of chondrocytes were improved considerably compared with polysaccharides/PVA,PVA-Mand PVA hydrogels.These results demonstrate the synergistic effects of polysaccharidesand nanoparticles in increasing chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation on PVA hydrogels.

The effect of scaffold pore size on chondrocyte growth and proliferation has been widely investigated on chitosan, chitosan-hyaluronic acid,gelatin and polycaprolactone scaffolds with pore diameters ranging from 10 to $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ .Theresults showed that chondrocyte growth was favorable on large pores $( 2 5 0 - 5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ in comparison to that on small pores $( \leq 1 0 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ [39-42]. In our case, the pore size of hydrogels ranged from 5 to $3 3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,which is smaller than that reported in the literature.In fact, in our experiments,there are no significant effects of pore size on chondrocyte adhesion and growth within this pore size range.

The routine compressive stress on the knee is about 3 MPa, whereas that on hip is $7 { - } 1 8  { \mathrm { M P a } }$ [43].Moreover,the compressive strength of cancellous bone is about $3 { \mathrm { - } } 2 0  { \mathrm { M P a } }$ [44]. The compressive strength values of our composite hydrogels are more than

$2 5 \mathsf { M P a }$ ,which means that the hydrogels may sustain the routine loading when they were used as cartilage substitutes.

In this study，magnetic composite nanoparticles possessed the ability to improve cell adhesion and proliferation on PVA hydrogels.Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles could increase cell growth;this study Was reported by Poursamar et al.[45],who adopted an in situ method to synthesize hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and fabricated hydroxyapatite and PVA composite scaffold by freeze-drying technique.The results showed that hydroxyapatite nanoparticles could support osteoblast growth.In this article,there were more chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation on magnetic nanoparticles and PVA composite hydrogels than on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and PVA composite hydrogels.The $\mathsf { F e } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 }$ magnetic nanoparticles were incorporated into hydroxyapatite nanoparticles,improving the chondrocyte growth ability compared to hydroxyapatite nanoparticles.The similar trends were also confirmed by the research of Nhiem and Webster [46],who proved that $\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } 0 _ { 4 }$ and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles presented better osteoblast growth behavior than hydroxyapatite nanoparticles alone.

Polysaccharides (HA and CS) are the main components of extracellular matrix(ECM) and have the ability to increase cell adhesion, proliferationand migration.In this study,single polysaccharides (HA or CS）added into PVA hydrogels could promote chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation on PVA hydrogels.In addition, combined polysaccharides(HA and CS）presented better chondrocyte growth behavior than single HA or CS polysaccharides in increasing chondrocyte growth.Furthermore,the synergistic effects between magnetic composite nanoparticles and polysaccharides could present better chondrocyte growth behavior than magnetic composite nanoparticles or polysaccharides.

# 4.Conclusions

Natural polysaccharides,i.e.HA and CS,have been introduced into freeze-thawed PVA and magnetic nanocomposite PVA hydrogels.The presence of polysaccharides dramatically increased the pore sizes and the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR)of PVA hydrogels,without losing the mechanical strength.The adhesion and proliferation of chondrocytes on PVA-M hydrogels were significantly enhanced in comparison to $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 3 } / { \sf P V } \sf A$ and nHAP/PVA hydrogels.An optimal formulation of 5HA/PVAhydrogels has been demonstrated to best support chondrocyte adhesion and growth.

Moreover,a combination of HA or CS into PVA effectively favors chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation,which appears superior to any single polysaccharide. Our results indicate synergistic effects of nanoparticles and polysaccharides in increasing chondrocyte adhesion and proliferation.The composite hydrogels of natural polysaccharides and magnetic PVA may have potentials in biomedical applications.
