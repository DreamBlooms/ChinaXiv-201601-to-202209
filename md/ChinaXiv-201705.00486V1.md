# ABSTRACT

Keywords: UHMWPE Lipid Oxidation Polyphenol Irradiation

The uptake of synovial lipids into ultra high molecular weight polyethylene(UHMWPE）has been recently related with the invivo and ex vivo oxidation of iradiated and remelted UHMWPE.Natural polyphenols have been demonstrated effective in protecting highly croslinked UHMWPE from oxidation.This manuscript aims to investigate how squalene as a model unsaturated lipid affects the oxidative stability of polyphenol-stabilized highly crossinked UHMWPE.The irradiated UHMWPE showed less squalene uptake and diffusion in comparison to the unirradiated UHMWPE due to the crosslinked structures in the former.Upon accelerated aging at $7 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ and 5 atm $0 _ { 2 }$ for different durations,the presence of squalene significantlyaccelerated the initiation,development and propagation of oxidation for the virgin and irradiated UHMWPE.The presence of antioxidants including natural polyphenols effectively prosponded and reduced oxidation of the squalene-doped irradiated UHMWPEs.The oxidation levels and depth of irradiated antioxidant/UHMWPE blends were much less than those for the irradiated UHMWPE.It is concluded that the natural polyphenols are efective in prohibiting oxidation related to the presence of squalene.This finding may be of clinical relevance in terms of stabilization of irradiated UHMWPE against synovial lipids-related oxidation.

# 1.Introduction

Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene(UHMWPE) has been the material of choice for total joint implants since the 196Os [1]. The long term oxidation of UHMWPE components remains as one of the most relevant concerns in total joint arthroplasty(TJA)[2-4]. Free radicals generated by radiation sterilization or crosslinking to improve the wear resistance [5] are prone to react with oxygen on shelf or in vivo through a cyclic radical process,leading to the degradation of polymer chains and loss of mechanical strength and toughness and wear resistance.

Toavoid the UHMWPE oxidation initiated by free radicals,gas sterilization[1], gamma sterilizing in the absence of oxygen [6],or post-irradiation thermal treatments [7-9] have been used to manufacture oxidation resistant UHMWPE.Although the uncrosslinked,non-ionizing gas (e.g.,ethylene oxide) sterilized UHMWPE showed undetectable oxidation [1O] and slight measurable amounts of oxidation were observed in the retrieved inserts [11], suchmaterialsare currentlyless preferable formedical implantsas a result of their inferior wear resistance [12]. Some studies suggest that gamma sterilizing in the absence of oxygen prevented the shelf oxidation,but did not prevent in vivo oxidation [13].Once it is removed from the package,it will begin to oxidize and degrade [14-16].Post-irradiation thermal treatments,i.e.，remelting or annealingof irradiated UHMWPE,have been conducted to reduce or eliminate the free radicals to improve the oxidation resistance of irradiated UHMWPE[17-19].However,recent studies reported in vivo oxidation of remelted highly crosslinked UHMWPE [20,21], despite that these materials have previously been demonstrated stable against accelerated aging in laboratory tests [22,23].It has been hypothesized that cyclic loadingand/orlipidabsorption,are potential mechanisms that alter the stability of UHMWPE [24]. Historically,Costa et al.have demonstrated in vivo diffusion of apolar synovial lipids including squalene,cholesterol,and methyl esters of 7-hexadecenoic and cholesterol into UHMWPE components [25].A recent report based on in vitro experiments has suggested that squalene,as well as many other absorbed unsaturated synovial fluid lipids,could be related to the initiation of oxidation of thecrosslinked and remelted polyethylenes [26],which may be a new mechanism for the stability loss of the irradiated and remelted polyethylenes [20].

On the other hand,stabilization of irradiated polyethylene with antioxidants has been widely investigated and has demonstrated promising to avoid post-irradiation thermal treatments [27-29]. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE stabilized with vitamin Ehas been introduced for clinical use in TJA[3O-33].Moreover,Fu etal. have demonstrated that vitamin E after high temperature melting and high dose irradiation is effective in protecting UHMWPE from oxidation with the presence of squalene [34].

Our previous findings have suggested that natural polyphenols provide improved oxidativestability ofhighly crosslinked UHMWPE in comparison to the irradiated vitamin E/UHMWPE [27]. It is likely that the reaction of polyphenol molecules to the free radicals interrupts the cyclic oxidation process [35]. It would be of clinical relevance to further investigate how these polyphenolstabilized highly crosslinked UHMWPE will behave against aggressive oxidative challenging with the presence of an unsaturated model lipid.We hypothesize that trace amount of polyphenols may also offer superior resistance against lipid-related oxidation.In order to examine this hypothesis,high dose irradiated UHMWPE blended with natural polyphenols (i.e.,gallic acid and dodecyl gallate） were doped with squalene and challenged with 5 atm oxygen at $7 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for different durations.Highly crosslinked vitamin E/UHMWPE blends were used as reference.

# 2.Materials and methods

# 2.1.Consolidation and electron beam irradiation of antioxidant/ UHMWPEblends

Gallic acid,dodecyl gallate (both were purchased from Nanjing Duly Biotech Co.,Ltd,China),and vitamin E(Sigma Aldrich, Shanghai,China）were blended with medical grade UHMWPE powders(GUR 1050,Orthoplastics,UK) at antioxidant(AO) concentrations of 0.23,0.46,1.1,2.3,and $6 . 9 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ .Theblended powders were preheated at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ in a vacuum oven before consolidation at $1 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ and $1 0 ~ \mathsf { M P a }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ [27]. The consolidated blocks were vacuum-packaged and irradiated at $3 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y } / \$ pass to total doses of 6o and $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ by using a $1 0 \mathrm { \ M e V }$ electron beam (Huaneng Electron Accelerator Company, Shaoxing,China).The sample temperature after each irradiation run was no higher than $5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ Cubes $( 1 \times 1 \times 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ were machined from these irradiated blocks for doping with squalene and accelerated aging.

# 2.2.Doping in squalene (SQ)

Cubes $( 1 \times 1 \times 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } ;$ of unirradiated, $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated virgin and AO-blended UHMWPE were immersed in preheated squalene (Sigma Aldrich,Shanghai, China) at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ for 2,4,8,and $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ in a convection oven.Subsequently, the samples were taken out of the squalene bath and cooled down to room temperature.Finally, the excessive squalene on sample surfaces were wiped with cotton gauze.

Gravimetric changes as a result of doping were determined by weighing the cubes before and after doping by using a $0 . 0 1 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ balance (Sartorius BT125D,Goettingen,Germany).The percentage weight changes are used to compare the squalene absorption for different materials.

# 2.3.Accelerated agingof irradiated polymermaterials

Squalene-doped irradiated cubes $( 1 \times 1 \times 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } .$ wereaged for 4,7,10,14,21,and 28 days in a pressure chamber with 5 atm oxygen at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ Squalene-free cubes were aged under the same conditions for 28 days as control.

# 2.4.Microscopic Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy

The above prepared sample cubes were cut half apart and microtomed into $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ thick slices by using an ERM30oO Semiautomatic Rotary Microtome (Hao Si Lin Medical Instrument Co., Ltd.,Changzhou,China).The slices were line-scanned across in transmission mode by using a Cary 61O microscope equipped with a Cary 64O FTIR spectrometer (Agilent,Australia).Each spectrum was recorded as an average of 32 individual infrared scans from 400 to $4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ at a resolution of $4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ The content of squalene was indexed by normalizing the squalene band at $1 1 5 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $( 1 1 3 4 - 1 1 6 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ）against _the polyethylene skeletal band at $1 8 9 5 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ 1 $\mathrm { ^ { \prime } } 1 8 5 0 { - } 1 9 8 5 \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ).This squalene index $( I _ { \mathrm { S Q } } )$ was plotted as a function of position across the cubes, generating a squalene distribution profile for each sample.The slices of doped and aged samples were refluxed in hexane for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ to remove small molecule oxidation products and then dried in vacuum for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at room temperature.Finally,these posthexane slices were microscopic FTIR scanned in transmission mode in order to determine the oxidation profles.Each IR spectrum was normalized by using the $2 0 1 8 ~ \mathrm { \bar { c m } } ^ { - 1 }$ band $( \mathrm { C H } _ { 2 }$ twisting)as the internal reference to an absorbance of O.O5 for a film thickness of ca. $1 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ [36]. The oxidation index $( I _ { \mathrm { O x I } } )$ were calculated as the ratio of the peak area at $1 7 1 8 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $( 1 6 8 0 - 1 8 2 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ，carbonyl stretching）to that at $1 3 6 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $( 1 3 7 0 - 1 3 9 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ，polyethylene end methyl) as per ASTM F2102- 01.The average surface oxidation index was defined as the average of the oxidation indices of the first $1 . 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ from the sample surface.

# 3.Results and discussion

# 3.1. Squalene doping and diffusion

Squalene doping was conducted at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ to unirradiated,60, and $9 0 \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated UHMWPE with or without antioxidants.The weight gain values of these polyethylenes after $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 2 h }$ -dopingare summarized in Table 1.Moreover, the percentage weight changes of these polymers are compared in Fig.1as there are differences in the initial weight of the cubes.The irradiation dose or crosslink density has an influence on the squalene uptake.First,for each group containing a specific antioxidant concentration,the squalene uptakewas lesswithahigher irradiation dose $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ .Thesqualene absorption for the unirradiated polymers was about $40 \%$ higher than for the $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated materials.Second, the squalene uptake of the materials with antioxidants was higher than those of virgin UHMWPE at each irradiation dose.The vitamin E-blended UHMWPE showed the highest squalene uptake among the irradiated AO/UHMWPEs.Third,witha higherantioxidant concentration, the squalene uptake was less.It has been reported that the irradiatedvitaminE/UHMWPEblendsat relativelyhigh vitamin Econcentrations showed lower crosslink densities than the irradiated counterparts containing gallic acid (GA) and dodecyl gallate(DG) [27] and irradiated virgin UHMWPE [37,38]. These results suggest that it would be difficult for squalene to diffuse into a densely crosslinked polymer network.

In doped UHMWPE,squalene showed characteristic absorbances at $1 6 6 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ 0 $\mathsf { C } { \mathrm { = } } { \mathsf { C } }$ stretching）and 1151 $\mathsf { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (C-H bending）in addition to those of polyethylene (Fig.2(a)). These bands are normalized against the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 }$ band of polyethylene at $1 8 9 5 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and subtracted by the normalized spectrum of virgin UHMWPE.The difference spectrum shows the characteristic absorbances of squalene (Fig.2(a)).By performing a line scan of squalene-doped samples with a microscopic FTIR,the spatialresolved difference spectra show a decay of the $1 1 5 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ band (orsqualene concentration) from the free surface $( 0 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ toward the internal bulk (Fig.2(b)).Hereafter, the $1 1 5 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ band is used to index the squalene levels in doped polyethylenes.

The irradiation dose showed remarkable influences on the uptake and diffusion of squalene.Fig.3(a） presents representative squalene profiles of the unirradiated and $9 0 ~ \mathrm { \ k G y }$ irradiated UHMWPE and VE/UHMWPE after doping and diffusion in hot squalene for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .Theunirradiated UHMWPE and VE/UHMWPE

exhibited identical squalene uptake and diffusion profiles (Fig.3(a)).Squalene diffused into more than $5 \mathrm { m m }$ into the samples. In contrast, the $9 0  { \mathrm { \ k G y } }$ irradiated polyethylene and blends showed a lower squalene uptake.The squalene diffusion depth into the irradiated UHMWPE was about $2 . 8 \mathrm { m m }$ ,close to that for the $9 0  { \mathrm { k G y } }$ irradiated VE/UHMWPE (Fig.3(a)).The squalene uptake for the irradiated UHMWPE was lower than that for the irradiated $\mathsf { V E } /$ UHMWPE,due to the higher crosslink density of the former [27].

The diffusion of squalene into UHMWPE basically obeys the Fick's second law of diffusion. Accordingly, curve fitting and analysis were conducted for the squalene profiles in Fig.3(a). At $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ the diffusion coefficients of squalene $( D _ { \mathsf { S Q } } )$ inunirradiated UHMWPE and VE/UHMWPE were $3 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \ \mathrm { { \text m m } } ^ { 2 } / s$ In contrast, the $D _ { \mathrm { S Q } }$ values in $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated UHMWPE and VE/UHMWPE were $1 \mathrm { { . 0 } } \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \mathrm { { \ m m } } ^ { 2 } / s$ and $2 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \ \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 } / s$ ,respectively. The semi-crystalline nature of UHMWPE and the crosslinking in the amorphous phase will affect squalene diffusion. Crystalline regions are deemed to hinder the diffusion of molecules by restricting the diffusion pathways [32].Moreover,our findings show that the weight changes and the diffusion coefficient difference between the unirradiated UHMWPE and irradiated UHMWPE were very significant for squalene doping,which indicates that the crosslinked network in the amorphous phase may unfavour squalene diffusion.Moreover, the diffusion depth increased over time from about $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ at $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ to $2 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ at $^ { 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and $5 \mathrm { m m }$ at $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ (Fig. 3(b)).

It is interesting to observe that the surface squalene concentration appeared independent on the doping time,probably indicating a saturation absorption on surface.For a specific sample,e.g., the $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated $2 . 3 \mathrm { \ m m o l / L }$ DG/UHMWPE cube,the total squalene uptake at $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ was $2 5 . 6 \pm 1 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ ,oran overall squalene concentration of $6 2 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L } ,$ ，which is much higher than the DG concentration.It is roughly estimated that the surface squalene concentration is more than one magnitude of order higher than the antioxidant concentration.Therefore,it is reasonable to believe that the absorbed squalene is adequate to exhaust the antioxidants to induce severe oxidation of UHMWPE upon accelerated aging.

# 3.2.Oxidation of irradiated virgin and antioxidant-containing UHMWPEwith the presenceof squalene

To examine the effect of squalene on the oxidation of $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated AO/UHMWPE blends,cubic samples doped with squalene at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ were cooled to room temperature and then aged at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ in 5 atm $0 _ { 2 }$ for14 days (ASTMF2003).Previous study showed undetectable oxidation of irradiated AO/UHMWPE after acceleratedagingaccording to ASTMF2oo3 [27].Afteragingwith the presence of squalene,IR scans across the thin slices showed oxidation gradients from the free surface toward the sample bulk, asindicatedby the decaying oxidation product band centered at $1 7 1 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (Fig. 4(a)). This absorbance is a sum of oxidation products from both polyethylene and squalene.Hexane extraction was conducted on the thin slices to remove the oxidation products from squalene.The spectra of samples after hexane extraction (posthexane) showed lower absorbances at $1 7 1 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ than for the prehexane ones (Fig.4(b)).All the results reported hereafter are based on the post-hexane IR spectra unless otherwised specified.

Fig.5 shows the oxidation profiles of irradiated AO/UHMWPE doped with squaleneand aged in5 atm $0 _ { 2 }$ at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for up to 14 days.The irradiated VE/UHMWPE and DG/UHMWPE with $0 . 2 3 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ antioxidants showed no detectable oxidation before agingand slight surface oxidation (depth $\sim 1 \ \mathrm { m m } ;$ after14day aging(Fig.5(a and b)).In contrast, the irradiated GA/UHMWPE showed remarkable oxidation (Fig. 5(c))， probably due to the relativelylowantioxidationactivityofGA inUHMWPE[35].With the presence of squalene,severe surface oxidation occurred and proceeded toward the cube bulk over time （Fig. $\displaystyle 5 ( \mathsf { a } - \mathsf { c } ) )$ . The average surface oxidation levels increased linearly over time and appeared almost independent on the chemistry of antioxidants (Fig.5(d)).On the other hand, the oxidation depth for all samples increased overtime.The factthat the oxidationlevels of squalenedoped samples aged for 4 day are much higher than those of squalene-free samplesaged for14 days indicatesa strongrelation of squalene absorption to the oxidation of these antioxidantstabilized UHMWPE.

Fig.6 summarizes the evolution of the average surface oxidation levels over time for the $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated AO/UHMWPE with different antioxidant concentrations. The squalene uptake for all these samples after $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ -doping were almost the same.For $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated VE/UHMWPE,the surface oxidation levels were lower with higher vitamin E concentrations (Fig.6(a)).With $1 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ vitamin E,no detectable oxidation occurred until day 10.The oxidation initiation was further postponed to day 14 for $2 . 3 \ : \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ VE.No oxidation was detectable with $6 . 9 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ VE at day 28 (Fig. 6(a)). Similarly, oxidation wasalso retarded by the presence of DG(Fig.6(b)） and GA(Fig. $6 ( \mathrm { c } ) _ { \cdot } ^ { \cdot }$ ).According to these results, $2 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ antioxidants are adequate to inhibit squalene-related surface oxidation for 14 day agingas per ASTM F2003.

Fig.7 compares the post-hexane oxidation profiles of the aged squalene-doped irradiated AO/UHMWPE blends with different antioxidant concentrations.With the antioxidant concentration increasing from $0 . 2 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ to 0.46,1.1, 2.3,and $6 . 9 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ the oxidation levels decreased at the surface and in the bulk.The oxidation levels became very low with the presence of $2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ antioxidants.The effect of antioxidant concentration on the average surface oxidation index at day 14 is shown in Fig.7(d). At a given concentration,GA gives the highest oxidation level,while VE and

DG are close to each other.No detectable oxidation was found for the irradiated UHMWPE with AO concentrations above $2 . 3 \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ DG.

Fig.8 compares the oxidation profiles of squalene-doped irradiated UHMWPE blends with different antioxidants after accelerated aging.First, the irradiated AO/UHMWPE blends doped with squalene showed lower oxidation levels than for the irradiated virgin UHMWPE doped with squalene.For the antioxidant-blended UHMWPE,the $I _ { \mathrm { O x I } }$ was less than the virgin polyethylene.The $9 0 ~ \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated virgin polyethylene showed the highest $I _ { \mathrm { O x I } } ,$ while the UHMWPE blends with1.1and $2 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ antioxidant had relative low $I _ { \mathrm { O x I } }$ values.Furthermore,there was no measurable oxidation for the 2.3 mmol/LDG/UHMWPE,which suggests that DG ismore potent than VEand GAin stabilizing the irradiated polyethylene.Although there existed surface oxidation of VE-and GA

blended samples,a stronger stabilization at the cubic center was achieved compared to the virgin PE.

Previous studies have reported the effective stabilization of irradiated high temperature melted vitamin E/UHMWPE blends doped with squalene although some of vitamin E has changed the chemical structure upon irradiation [34].The resonant structures of irradiated vitamin E have been reported potent in stabilization of irradiated UHMWPE [39]. Recently,we have also reported that two polyphenols(i.e.,gallic acid and dodecyl gallate）are potent in stabilistation of highly crosslinked UHMWPE and even provide prolonged protection of irradiated UHMWPE against aggressive invitro oxidative challengesatlowantioxidant concentrationsin comparison to their vitamin E counterparts [27]. In the current work,our results suggest that the natural polyphenols offer superior resistance against oxidation at the presence of squalene,a model lipid that has beenused by Oral etal. to simulate the lipidrelated oxidation of polyethylene [26].This study is effective in distinguishing the oxidation resistance of these antioxidants at a relatively short experimental time scale.At a given antioxidant concentration,the oxidation initiation time and oxidation penetration depth are two important parameters to assess the potency of the antioxidants by comparing the oxidation levels and oxidation profiles.To this end, the DG/UHMWPE blends showed the lowest oxidation levels and penetration depth while the GA/UHMWPE blends showed the highest oxidation levels and penetration depth among the antioxidant/UHMWPE blends at $1 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ (Fig. 8(a)). These $9 0 \mathrm { k G y }$ irradiated materialshardly oxidize with the presence of $2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ DG after accelerated aging for 14 days (Figs.7(b and e),8(b)).This irradiation dose is close to those for the highly crosslinked UHMWPE materials for clinical use.Thus,the results presented in this study may have clinical relevance in terms of oxidative stability.

The clinical relevance of these results,however, is limited in at least three aspects. First, the oxygen concentration and temperature under clinical conditions are much lower than the current experimental conditions.Thus,the real-time oxidation invivo or exvivo would bemuch slower than what we observed under in vitro accelerated aging conditions.There is,however,no direct correlation between the accelerated agingand the real-time oxidation,which could otherwise help predict the oxidative stability of the highly crosslinked UHMWPE components in the long term.Second, the concentration of unsaturated lipids in the synovial fluids and amount diffused into the UHMWPE components are much lower than the squalene model used in this study. On the other hand,the accelerated aging temperature $( 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ and oxygen concentration are much higher than those available in the body. The in vivo lipid oxidation,if any, must be much slower than those for the accelerated aging study. In fact,it is not clear how the absorbed lipids affect the in vivo oxidation and performance of highly crosslinked and remelted UHMWPE components,although ex vivo stability loss of irradiated and remelted UHMWPE components might be attributed to the absorbed lipids.Third,the chemistry and amount of unsaturated lipids diffused into UHMWPE components [25] are more complicated than the squalene model investigated in this study.Moreover, the synovial lipids may vary among individuals,which may complicate the oxidation mechanisms.In fact,it remains unclear how the synovial lipids diffused into the UHMWPE componentsaffect their oxidative stability over long term clinical service.

# 4. Conclusions

This study presents the experimental modeling of the absorption of synovial lipids into highly crosslinked UHMWPE with antioxidants.The absorbed squalene deteriorates the oxidation stability of all the highly crosslinked UHMWPE and antioxidant/ UHMWPE blends.Importantly,our results demonstrate that gallic acid and dedecyl gallate provide outstanding protection of highly crosslinked UHMWPE against the squalene-related oxidation. Our hypothesis tested positive.Both the oxidation levelsand penetration depth are much lower than for the irradiated virgin UHMWPE. All of the antioxidants at $2 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / L }$ provide sufficient protection to squalene-doped highly crosslinked UHMWPE against accelerated aging for 14 days,without showing detectable oxidation by FTIR.
