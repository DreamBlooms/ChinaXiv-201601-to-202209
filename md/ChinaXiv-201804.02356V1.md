Abstract. The present paper is a continuation and extension of [1] to CLASH clusters. We study the total, the dark matter density profiles,and correlations in a subgroup of CLASH clusters, as we did for the Newman's clusters. As in the case of Newman clusters, we find that the DM density profile is strongly influenced by interactions with baryons,and the energy and angular momentum transferred from baryons to DM through dynamical friction. The inner slope of the dark matter density profles of the clusters are usually flatter than the Navarro-Frenk-White profile inner slope, with maximum value -0.79,and minimum -0.30. As in the case of Newman clusters, there are a series of correlations among the slope $\alpha$ of the dark matter profile,and: a. the core radius of clusters; b. the effective radius $R _ { e }$ ；c.the mass of the Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG); d. the total baryonic mass,and stellar mass of the clusters. We also found a correlation between the efective radius and the virial mass.

The clusters structure, their total and DM density profiles,and the correlations are understood in a double phase scenario. In the first dissipative phase, the BGC forms. In the second dissipationless phase, the interactions between of baryon cluamps with DM through dynamical friction (DF), fattens the DM distribution. The final result of the two phases is the formation of clusters with different DM distribution, inner slopes, and several correlations between characteristic quantities of the clusters.

# 1 Introduction

The ACDM paradigm gives a plethora of correct predictions [1-5], and a series of not correct ones. It predicts that the density profiles of all structures,from dwarf galaxies to clusters is cuspy [6,7]1. Observations ([14,15],and theoretical results [16-21] have shown that the inner slopes of the density profile in dwarf galaxies, and low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBs), are usually fatter than simulations (the so called cusp-core problem), and there are strong diversity of distribution of DM in similar objects (the so caled "diversity problem"） [21-23].

Due to the lack of HI the determination of the DM structure in dSPhs,and elliptical galaxies is much more complicated, because of degeneracies related to the mass probes used in the profile determination (see [24]） because of the small dynamic range of observations) . In the case of dSphs there are discrepant results on the cusp-core nature of the density profile [25-28], sometime, even in the case of the same object, studied with different techniques.

Similar uncertainties are present in cluster of galaxies, but they can be overcome in a easier manner than in dSPhs or elipticals,since in cluster one can combine X-ray observations, lensing and the dynamics of galaxies.

Several studies [29-34], combining different kind of observations found that while the total density profile in clusters is more or less well described by the NFW profile, the inner DM structure is characterized by a flatter inner slope within a radius typical of the BCG radius (from some kpcs to some tens of kpcs). Then， as already reported, the cusp-core problem and the so called diversity problem [21, 23] are also present in clusters of galaxies $^ 2$ ：

As shown by some studies, the quoted discrepancy is eliminated when the results of Nbody dissipationless simulations are corrected by taking into account the effects of baryons [17-20, 36-42] Cardone2011,Jardel2009,

In order to study how baryons modify the formation and evolution of clusters, in [43] we used the baryon clumps interacting with DM model introduced in [17] model. Apart finding that baryons mainly concentrated in the inner 1O kpc have an important role in shaping the clusters density profiles, finding correlations of the inner profile from the baryon content, we reproduced some clusters profiles, namely A611， A383, MACS J1423.8+2404, RXJ1133, in agreement with the observational studies of [30-32].

In[1]，we studied MS2137，A963，A383，A611，A2537，A2667，A2390，observed by [33,34],and reobtaining the correlations found by them, the total mass density profile,well fitted by a NFW pofile,and the DM mass distribution, shallower than the total mass density profile.

The formation picture proposed by [33, 34] is characterized by a dissipational formation of the BCGs,and by a second dissipationless phase. In this phase, similarly to what described by [17, 21,36, 37, 39, 42-47] baryon clumps interact with DM through dynamical friction "heating” DM and reducing the inner cusp.

Our aim here is to study the CLASH clusters in order to see if we have correlations similar to those observed in the [33,34] clusters,to study the mass distribution in the clusters, and to verify the “physical picture” proposed by [33,34], and confirmed in [1].

To this aim we use the data of 16 of the 20 CLASH clusters [48], the unmagnified ones, to repeat an analisys similar to the one performed in [1, 43]. We will reproduce the total masss density profile obtained in [48],by means of a modified version of the model used in [1,43], taking into account, among other efects,adiabatic contraction responsible of the steepening of the density profiles of clusters in their early phase formation epoch, the interaction between baryonic clumps and DM through dynamical friction,responsible of “heating” the DM component and flattening the density profile, supernovae feedback, AGN feedback and other effects described in detail in the Appendix. The aim is similarly to [1, 33, 34] to check if the total density profile is approximated by a NFW profile or an Einasto's profile,and to see if also in the CLASH clusters we find correlations between the inner slope and the total baryonic content of the clusters,and correlations with other quantities like the effective radius of the BCG, the DM mass, etc.

The plan of the paper is the following. In section 2, we discuss the data used,and give a short qualitative summary of the model. In section 3, we discuss the results, and section 4 is devoted to conclusions.

# 2 Data used,and summary of the model

The data we use in our analisys comes from a sample of 20 X-ray regular clusters of galaxies with $0 . 1 9 \lesssim z \lesssim 0 . 6 9$ from which 4 high-magnification clusters were excluded, because they are disturbed merging clusters without a well defined center, chosen from the galaxy clusters at Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). In particilar, we use the data presented in [48]. The data come from an analysis through weak-lensing shear of the regular clusters,obtained combining wide-field multi-color imaging got with the Subaru Telescope (Suprime-Cam),spanning the cluster radii $1 0 ^ { ^ { \prime \prime } } - 1 6 ^ { ^ { \prime } }$ "，and 16-band Hubble Space Telescope observations. [48] reconstructed, for each cluster, the surface mass density profile, determinimg their masses and concentrations, in good agreement with the ACDM expectations, when taking into account the CLASH selection fuction. [48] obtained an ensemble averaged surface mass density profile, stacking the clusters profiles, which is cuspy, and wel described (e.g.) by profiles like the NFW profile, or the Einasto's profiles.

[48](Table 1） found the radial mass distribution for the quoted 2O CLASH clusters using the weak- and strong-lensing data of 49, 50l. The mass profile solution of each cluster was obtained from a joint likelihood analysis of their weak-lensing shear, strong-lensing,and magnification data. The quoted mass profiles are shown in Fig. 11 of [48]

The estimation of cluster massand its radial distribution, can be obtained in different ways. One way is using a Bayesian MCMC approach [48] to obtain an inference of the NFW

density profile (EQ. 2.1),

$$
\rho ( r ) = \frac { \rho _ { c } \delta _ { c } } { r / r _ { s } ( 1 + r / r _ { s } ) ^ { 2 } }
$$

where $r _ { s } = r _ { 2 0 0 } / c$ is the scale radius, $r _ { 2 0 0 }$ the virial radius $c$ the concentration,being $\rho _ { c }$ the critical density, inside which the mass density of the halo is $2 0 0 \rho _ { c }$ ，and

$$
\delta _ { c } = \frac { 2 0 0 c ^ { 3 } / 3 } { \ln ( 1 + c ) - c / ( 1 + c ) }
$$

using the data in the form of the discrete cluster mass profile $\mathbf { s } = \pmb { \Sigma } / \Sigma _ { c , \infty }$ and its covariance matrix. The cluster mass profile can be fitted with a $\Sigma ( R ) _ { N F W }$ profile like that of [51] giving a good aproximation to the projected density profile till the virial radius,in the case of cluster-sized haloes [52]. The parameters can be inferred using a $\chi ^ { 2 }$ like that used by [48]

$$
\chi ^ { 2 } ( \mathbf { p } ) = \sum _ { i , j } [ s _ { i } - \mathbf { s _ { i } } ( \mathbf { p } ) ] C _ { i j } ^ { - 1 } [ s _ { i } - \mathbf { s _ { i } } ( \mathbf { p } ) ]
$$

where $\mathbf { p } = ( M _ { 2 0 0 c } , c _ { 2 0 0 c } )$ ，and $\mathbf { s } ( \mathbf { p } ) = \Sigma / \Sigma _ { c , \infty }$ (see [48])

In the case the surface density profile is not cuspy (e.g. a Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS)) one needs a an appropriate surfce density, $\Sigma ( R ) _ { S I S }$ , for the fit, or the lensing shear in a given radius (see [51]).

As already discussed the density profiles of the 16 CLASH clusters are well approximated by a NFW profile, whose parameters are reported in Table 2 of [48].

In this paper， we will generate clusters having 3 dimensional density pofiles whose surface density profiles are in agreement with those obtained by [48] (Fig. 11). In order to compare with the 2D surface density of [48], starting from the 3 dimensional density profile, （204 $\rho ( r )$ we get the surface density integrating $\rho ( r )$ （204号

$$
\Sigma ( R ) = 2 \int _ { 0 } ^ { \infty } { \rho ( R , z ) d z }
$$

being $R$ the projected radius with respect to the cluster center (see also Secs. 5.2, 5.2.2 of [48]).

In order to obtain the 3 dimensional density profile of the clusters, we used a modified version of the model described in [1], qualitatively summarized in the following,and described in the Appendix.

In our model, the protostructure contains baryons and DM. After growing in a linear way, density contrast becomes enough large to stop the prostostructure expansion with Hubble flow, making it recollapse. DM collapse first and baryons follow. Clumps are formed because of radiative processes,and those clumps collapse to the protostructure centre to form stars. At high redshift ( $z \simeq 5$ in the case of a protostructure of $1 0 ^ { 9 } M _ { \odot }$ ） the collapsing DM compress baryons (adiabatic contraction). The formed clumps transfer energy and angular momentum to DM through dynamical friction. Then DM random motions amplitude increases and DM moves towards the outskirts of the protostructure, with a consequent reduction of the central DM density of the forming structure,and erasing or flattening of the initial cuspy profile. Protostructures giving rise to rotation supported galaxies, suffer a further flattening due to the aquisition of angular momentum in the collpse phase. Supernovae explosions, at later stages $z \simeq 2$ produce expulsion of gas, and the smallest clumps remaining after star formation are desrupted [42]. AGN feedback has, on larger scales a similar effect to that of SN feedback [40].

The results of our model were compared to the CLASH data as follows.

Using the quoted model,we calculated $\rho ( r )$ ．In [1,43],the DM density profile had been written as $\rho _ { D M } = F ( M _ { v i r } , f _ { B } , j )$ ，being $M _ { v i r }$ the cluster virial mass, $f _ { B }$ its baryon content,and $j$ the random angular momentum. In [1, 43], the density profile of the clusters studied was reproduced: a) assuming that the cluster final mass in the model is the same of the observed clusters,b) assuming that the baryon fraction is equal to that calculated by [53] data,and c) adjusting the value of the random angular momentum, to reproduce the observed clusters profiles.

In the present paper,the CLASH density profiles were reproduced in a slightly different manner. As in [1, 43], we assumed that the final mass of the protostructures generating one of the CLASH clusters is equal to the known mass of that cluster. The baryonic content, was not fixed as in [1,43],but the system, initially, has a baryon fraction equal to the universal baryon fraction $f _ { b } = 0 . 1 7 \pm 0 . 0 1$ [56],and the final baryon fraction was obtained from the star formation processes (see Appendix). The final baryon content, obtained in this way, has been compared with the [53] baryon and gas content in clusters,and was found in agreement with the result of the quoted authors (see also Fig. 1).

The "random” angular momentum was fixed following [57, 58]，and to get a better agreement with [48] data, it was slightly modified to obtain a better reproduction (fit) of the CLASH clusters density profiles Differently from [1, 43], the dark matter content was not obtained fitting through the model the total density profile, the baryon profile,and the virial mass. In CLASH clusters,we do not have the DM density profile, or the baryon density profile,but just the total density profile. In order to get the DM profile we subtacted from the total density (given by the data),the baryon density, given by the model.

# 3 Results and discussion

In [1,17, 21,43]，we showed how environment,angular momentum， and baryon content influence the characteristics of a structure. The inner density profiles of clusters are fatter in clusters having larger angular momentum [57-64] and larger baryons content (especially in the central region). In [1],we reproduced the total and DM density profiles of [33, 34], and the correlation that those authors found.

The results obtained by [33, 34],and confirmed by our study, are based on stronglensing，weak-lensing，and improved stellar kinematics with respect to study of the same author or [30]. [34] data allowed the determination of the stellar mass scale, allowing to produce a more physically consistent analysis, reducing the degeneracies among stellar and dark mass, and taking account the BCGs homogeneity. They showed that the total density profile is well approximated by a NFW profile, while the DM profile is usually fatter.

In Fig. 1, we compare the total mass surface density profiles obtained by [48] (dots with error bars)with our model prediction (the three lines,representing the best fit NFW profile (68% CL) to the the observed profile) in the case of A383 (left panel),and A6l1 (right panel). As shown, our model finely reproduces the [48] surface density, and shows that similarly to what found in [1, 33,34] that the total mass profile is well approximated by a cuspy profile as a NFW for both clusters. In the panel c, we show the 3D density profile of one of the clusters A611,obtained with our model. The gray band represents the stars content,the rose one is the DM, the brown one is the total mass,the dashes represent the total mass from the [48] data,and the line is the slope of the NFW profile. The width of the bands indicates the $1 \sigma$ uncertainties (see Sect. 4.3 of [34]).

![](images/78267beadc4be5f145e87e5039a2923fb3b16970a163d980e83466a6f756cd0b.jpg)  
Figure 1. 2 D density profile for A383 (left panel),and A61l (central panel). The dots with error bars are the [48] data,while the central and external lines represent the best fit NFW profile ( $6 8 \%$ CL) to the observed density profiles. The right panel is the 3 D density profile of A611. The blue, red,and brown bands represent the stars,DM,and total matter density profiles,respectively. The width of the bands indicates the 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty (see Sect. 4.3 of [34]).

Fig. 1 (panel c) shows that the density profles flattens in the inner region of A6ll where the BCG mass starts to be comparable or larger than the DM mass,and this happens in the inner $\simeq 5 - 1 0$ kpc (see [34] Fig. 3) (the situation is similar for the other clusters,whose relative plots was not shown). At this radii, the total density profile starts to be steeper than the DM density profile, due to the increase of the role of the baryon mass (mainly the BCG mass) at these radii. At radii $\geq 5 - 1 0$ kpc, in the case of all clusters, the total density profile and the DM profile are very close, since DM is dominating on the baryon component. Outside the inner region of the clusters the slope of the total density profiles (and also DM) are comparable in the diferent clusters. At these radii the DM density profile is in agreement with the NFW profile. At radii $\leq 3 0$ kpc, the total density profile is close to a NFW profile, and as observed by [34] this, somehow,implies a tight coordination among stars distribution and inner DM profle (see the folowing). Since the total mass (composed by the sum of the DM and the baryonic matter) is well described by a NFW profile, in the quoted inner regions of the cluster,and since the baryonic component is dominant in the 5-10 kpc central region, it is logical to expect that the DM density profile is flatter than a NFW one.

The previous trends are more clearly visible in Fig. 2,and better in Fig. 3,and 4.

In Fig.2,we plot the inner slope $\alpha$ vs baryon mass (top left panels) and stellar mass (bottom left panels). The dots with errorbars is obtained from a power law fit to the three inner points in the surface density profile. The top left panel represents the $\alpha$ vs baryon mass obtained from the model. The lines representa the ODR fits.

Fig. 2 shows how the 2D slope of the total mass density profile changes with baryor and stellar mass, in the observed clusters (left panels),and in the model (right panels)4. The dots with errorbars were obtained fitting the three inner points??? in the surface density profile with a line. The lines represent the ODR fits to data.

![](images/4dbb943ca6e8c1fa89df47a54e4a348b3faf0048057e2e1e8ce0f9031a2bda60.jpg)  
Figure 2. Inner 2D slope of the total mass density profile vs baryon mass (top left panel) and stelar mass(bottom left panel).The dots with errorbars come from a power law fit of the three inner points in the surface density profile. The top left panel represents the $\alpha$ vs baryon mass obtained from the model,calculating the surface density and then fititng the inner three points with a line.The lines representa the ODR fits.

The figure shows a weak correlation between the slope, $\alpha$ ，and $F _ { b }$ ，and a weak anticorrelation between the slope and $f _ { s t a r s }$ . The Spearman correlation coefficient is equal to -0.26 in the case $\alpha - F _ { b }$ , and 0.25 in the case $\alpha - f _ { s t a r s }$

This correlation is expected to be weak,since the total mass density profile of each cluster is well approximated by a NFW profile with smallscatter, and consequently we have a similar bevavior in the $\alpha - F _ { b }$ ， $\alpha - f _ { s t a r s }$ , correlations. We also calculated the correlation between the 3D DM slope and the same quantitiesm which is stronger,and has Spearman coefficients -O.44,and 0.43 respectively. The quoted correlation is stronger because differently from the total mass density profile,the DM profile varies noteworthy from cluster to cluster.

Fig. 3, plots the 3D DM slope, $\alpha$ , vs the BCG mass, $M _ { B C G }$ . From the plot it is evident that the larger is the BCG mass of a cluster the flatter is the inner density profile,in agreement with [1,34, 43]. This is expected since, being the total mass profile well represented by a NFW profile with slope $\simeq - 1$ , and since the total mass density profile is obtained summing the DM one,and the baryon one,which is dominating DM inside $5 - 1 0$ kpc,this implies that the DM profile must be flatter, the steeper is the baryon inner profile. The line represents the orthogonal distance regression (ODR) line, which differently from the linear least-square method takes into account the uncertainties in the variables. As in [1,34], the error on the BCG mass was assumed equal to 0.07 dex. The slope $\alpha$ ， was obtained by parameterizing the halo as a generalized NFW model (gNFW). We calculated again the Spearman rank correlation coefficient,which in this case is $\rho = - 0 . 6$ , and the P-value $P = 0 . 0 2$ testifying for a correlation between $\alpha$ and $M _ { B C G }$ ：

![](images/b92ab026d1a3743ca98b0a4647f1981f497ed6766f777ae9287608d06bdb1303.jpg)  
Figure 3. Correlation between the inner slope and the BCG DM mass. The mass of the BCM, （204号 $M _ { B C G }$ ， was obtained using our model. The error on the BCG mass was assumed equal to 0.07 dex [1,34]. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is -0.6.

Differently from Fig. 2,we do not compare the model result with observations, since there is just one study of the CLASH BGGs [65]，and it does not study the $\alpha - M _ { B C G }$ （204号 correlation. The last is studied just for 3 of the CLASH clusters, namely MS2137,A383, A611, by [1,34]. A comparison of our results with the $\alpha - M _ { B C G }$ relation of MS2137, A383, A611 from [1, 34], shows that our $\alpha - M _ { B C G }$ is in agreement with them ([34]).Moreover, is to be noticed that a comparison of the BCG mass in [65] with the ones common to [1,34] (MS2137, A383, A611) shows that [65] estimation are totally different from [34] (except for A383).

In Fig. 4,we plot the correlation $\alpha - R _ { e }$ ，being $R _ { e }$ the BCG effective radius (radius containing half of the light). 5.

The slope $\alpha$ ，was obtained by parameterizing the halo as a generalized NFW model (gNFW). The plot shows that clusters with larger $R _ { e }$ have a shallower inner slope. This correlation is in line with what was previously written. Since a) $M _ { D M } = M _ { t o t a l } - M _ { b a r y o n }$ ,b) the total mass is well described by a NFW profile, and c) a larger BCG contains more baryons, then the DM content is smallr. The line represents the ODR fit,while the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is $\rho = - 0 . 6 3$ and $P = 0 . 0 0 1 1 5 9$ ：

![](images/c4e198efbabd8500590f0a489e21aba6aea060bdf74096682e3ddd8e1a8e8ee5.jpg)  
Figure 4. Correlation between the inner slope and the BCG size. The slope was obtaining by fitting a gNFW model to the cluster obtained using our model. The line is the ODR ft to data. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is $\rho = - 0 . 6 3$ and $P = 0 . 0 0 1 1 5 9$ ：

The plot shows a scatter that is larger than the scatter observed in DM only simulations of clusters, like that of [?] (see also the top gray points in [34]). This issue is also present in galaxies,and it has beed dubbed the "diversity problem” [23, 43].

Finally, in Fig. 5, we show the correlation between the effective radius $R _ { e }$ , and the virial mass, $M _ { 5 0 0 }$ . The line represents again the ODR fit. The plot shows a positive correlation between the effective radius and the virial mass with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient $\rho = - 0 . 6 8$ ，and $P = 0 . 0 0 5$ . This is in agreement with previous studies e.g. [66],and in contradiction to [65]. The last authors found no correlation between the BCG mass and the virial mass. They justified this lack of correlation as due to a selection bias in the CLASH sample, due to a selection of clusters having BCGs of small mass. In reality, as previously noticed, the estimate of the BCGs mass by the same authors [65] is strikingly in contrast with the [34] clusters in common with the [65] CLASH sample. Moreover,[65] considered all the CLASH clusters,even the high magnification ones,which,as already reported,are disturbed merging clusters.

The shapes of the density profiles (Fig. 1),the scatter from cluster to cluster as well as the correlations shown in Fig. 3, 4,, can be explained according to our model [17, 21], as follows. At high $z$ ，the proto-structure,containing gas and DM, is in its linear phase. The DM mass component collapse before the baryonic mass component, and baryons falls in the DM potential wells,radiating part of their energy, and forming clumps which condense into stars (see [67] (Sect. 2.2.2， 2.2.3)） In the baryon collapse phase, DM is compressed ("adiabatic contraction” (AC))[68, 69] and stars form. This dissipational process, happening at $z \geq 5$ (see [17], Fig. 3,and 5） gives rise to a steep density profile,which constitutes the main structure of the BCG (see also [7O, 71] ), having a scale radius, $R _ { e } \simeq 3 0 ~ \mathrm { k p c }$ ，which is similar to the sizes of massive galaxies at high redshift ([72]; [33, 34]). Subsequent merging of satellites with the proto-BCG adds stars to the outer parts of the BCG (e.g.,[73, 74] ).

![](images/0f13502f532d88197e7419e4aab36617b1470830d98d7cd32cc86625e27e5606.jpg)  
Figure 5.Correlation between $R _ { e }$ and the virial radius. The dashed line is the ODR fit. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is $\rho = - 0 . 6 8$ and $P = 0 . 0 0 5$ ：

The clumps formed in the baryons collapse phase, moving to the center are exposed to the dynamical friction (DF) from DM particles. The result is a motion of the DM towards the outer parts of the proto-structure reducing the central DM density [17,36, 37, 39, 42, 47, 75].

Another mechanism proposed to flatten the DM profile is the feedback from AGN (e.g. [40]). However,the process seems to be "too effective”, since it produces a core of 10 kpc, which is much larger than what observed [76].

In our scenario, one expects a flattening of the DM density profile, and at the same time an anti-correlation of the inner DM slope, $\alpha$ ，with the central baryonic content of the cluster [17, 21, 37]. In our model the density profile shape is regulated by several quantities, and effects: a) angular momentum,b) baryonic fraction, c) virial mass, d) Supernovae and AGN feedback.

The flattening of the inner slope due to the angular momentum is due to the fact that the shels in a proto-structure having larger angular momentum, tend to remain closer to the maximum radius,and consequently they do not contribute to the central density. The fattening of the profle for larger angular momentum was also found by several authors [57, 58, 60-63, 77], and more recently by [78]. The dependence of the slope $\alpha$ on the baryonic mass of the whole cluster,and on the mass contained in the inner 1O kpc was one of the predictions of [21] (see Fig. 2,and Fig. 4b of the quoted paper). The tendency to have fatter profiles for clusters containing larger quantity of baryons, especially at the center, is due to the fact that the larger is the baryonic content of the cluster the larger is the angular momentum transferred from baryons to DM, through DF,with the quoted result that DM particles move away from the cluster center.

The profile steepens with mass because higher density peaks, characterized by larger （204号 $\nu ^ { 6 }$ are statistically the forefathers of more massive haloes,and the last have a larger central density contrast. Consequently, a generic shell will feel a stronger central potential and it will expand less than if the same shell was located in a smaller density peak. The final consequence is a lower quantity of angular momentum acquired in the expansion phase giving rise to haloes more concentrated.

Supernovae and AGN feedback transfer energy to DM particles, moving them on external orbits [40, 79].

In our model the proto-BCG forms at redshift $z \geq 2$ , in the dissipative baryonic collapse, and the further evolution of the BCG is due to later merging of stars on the BCG (e.g., [73,74]). Subsequently, satelites infalling in the halo produces an “heating” of DM, and a flattening of the inner slope ([17, 36,39, 75]).

Apart the correlations already discussed, in this scenario one expects further correlation among the inner mass of the clusters (5 kpc) mainly constituted by stars,and the mass of the core of the cluster (1O0 kpc),which at the quoted redshift was already formed,and was subsequently subject to little changes ([80l). In Fig. 5,we compare the mass in the central 5 kpc (mainly stars)，and that in $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { k p c }$ (mainly DM). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is $\rho = 0 . 6 4$ ， $P = 0 . 0 1 1$ .As we discuss further in the next section,this can be understood if the innermost regions of the present BCG and cluster halo were in place at early times and changed little in mass subsequently, with accretion mostly adding mass to the outer regions to grow the BCG and the cluster halo.

At the same time it is understood in the picture of the role of baryons in shaping the DM density profile. We showed that the baryonic content was of great importance in shaping the density profile,especially the baryonic content in the central $\simeq 1 0$ kpc,in the BCG. The cluster final configuration,its content in stars,its BCG characteristics， depends from the initial content of baryons,and by formation process. These considerations lead to think that the BCG mass and the BCG characteristics should be correlated to the baryonic and cluster mass

The previous discussion showed that the DM density profile of the clusters studied has $\alpha < 1$ , and that the total density profile is in agreement with a NFW profile.

The results concerning the clusters MS2137,and A383,are consistent with those of [30, 32]. [81] concluded that for any reasonable mass-to-light ratio,the central regions, where the stellar mass is important,are characterized by a shallwer DM profile, in agreement with $\alpha _ { \mathrm { D M } } = 0 . 9 2 _ { - 0 . 0 4 } ^ { + 0 . 0 5 }$ cnsicerigate found are also in agreement with [4O,41]. The mean slope,we find is $\alpha = 0 . 5 4 \pm 0 . 0 5$ ，in agreement with [34].

The inner DM profile is shallower than simulations DM-only simulations. Even considering simulations like [84] the minimum slope obtained, $\alpha \simeq - 0 . 8$ at 120 pc, is larger than the results of observations,and the scatter in the slope from cluster to cluster is much larger than what found in simulations. If some part of the scatter can be explained,in terms of the limits in techniques (e.g.， different dynamic ranges in the studies, the BCG role, simplified modeling of clusters) the difference in slope among some clusters is too big to be explained in this way. The discrepancy can be eliminated taking into account baryon physics (dominant in the inner part of clusters) in DM-only simulations.The mechanism described in the Appendix, dynamical friction from baryonic clumps ([17, 36,39, 45, 75], supernova-AGN-driven flattening ( [4O, 79] are able to reduce the inner density.

In addition to the astrophysical solution to the problem, other more radical solutions, modifying the particles constituting the DM (e.g., [85-88], modifying the power spectrum at small scales (e.g. [89], considering modified gravity.

Concerning the total density profile, the mean total density profile in our study is $\langle \gamma _ { \mathrm { t o t } } \rangle = 1 . 0 5 \pm 0 . 0 2 ^ { 7 }$ ,similar to that of [3] $\langle \langle \gamma _ { \mathrm { t o t } } \rangle = 1 . 1 6 \pm 0 . 0 5 _ { - 0 . 0 7 } ^ { + 0 . 0 5 } \rangle$ in the raialrange $r = r _ { 2 0 0 } \times ( 0 . 0 0 3 - 0 . 0 3 )$ ，in agreement with collisionless DM simulations ([33]，Section 9,[7])8. [90] found that the profile is NFW-like. [76, 91] found for MACS J1206.2-0847 $\alpha _ { \mathrm { t o t } } = 0 . 9 6 _ { - 0 . 4 9 } ^ { + 0 . 3 1 }$ and for A383 $\alpha _ { \mathrm { t o t } } = 1 . 0 8 \pm 0 . 0 7$ inageentwitrsult(ike profile in $r \gtrsim 5 - 1 0 ~ \mathrm { k p c }$ ). The stacked density profiles for four clusters studied by [92] gives Qtot = 0.89+0.27. , when excluding the inner $4 0 \ \mathrm { k p c } / h$ ：

# 4 Conclusions

In the present paper, similarly to [1],we studied a subsample of CLASH, with the aim of seeing if the DM density profiles of the quoted clusters has similar characteristics to those found in [1, 34],and if CLASH clusters show similar correlations to those of [1, 34].

To this aim,using the $M _ { 5 0 0 }$ mass of the clusters given in [48],obtaining the baryonic fraction with the [1,17?] model, and fixing the angular momentum as previously discussed, we reproduced the total mass surface density profiles of the CLASH clusters (except the high magnification ones) in [48]. The total mass 3 D density profile relative to the surface density profile,together with the baryon profile obtained with our model, alow us to obtain the DM profile of the clusters.

The 3 D total mass density profile is characterized by a slope $\langle \gamma _ { \mathrm { t o t } } \rangle = 1 . 0 5 \pm 0 . 0 2$ ,in the radius range $r = ( 0 . 0 0 3 - 0 . 0 3 ) r _ { 2 0 0 }$ , in agreement with several previous studies (e.g. [33, 34]).

In the radial range $5 - 1 0$ kpc the total mass is dominated by the star mass, while going towards the clusters outskirts,it is dominated by DM.

This result shows the existence of a tight coordination among the inner DM and the stars distribution,as implied by the fact that the NFW-like profile describing the profile is not generated by DM or baryons only but by their mutual action. The quoted coordination is further supported by the correlation among the mass in 5 kpc and that in 10o kpc (Fig. 6),which indicates that the time-scales of formation of the BCG and the inner cluster are similar. As discussed in [21], the final configuration of a cluster depends from the baryonic content and the formation process. In a hierarchical model of structure formation,we then should expect that the final inner baryonic content and the BCG mass are correlated to the total baryonic and to the mass of the cluster (see [93].

Since the total mass is obtained by summing the DM and baryons content,and moreover since baryons dominate in $5 - 1 0$ kpc in the inner 5-1O kpc baryons dominate,the inner density profile slope must be characterized by a slope flatter than that of the total mass density profile, （204号 $\alpha < 1$ . This is shown in the right panel in fig. 1,and by some of the correlations found. The inner slope of the clusters has values in the rangs -O.79,-0.30,

We also looked for correlations between several of the typical quantities of the clusters (e.g., $R e$ ， $M _ { v i r }$ etc).We found correlations between: a) the 3D inner slope of the DM density profile, $\alpha$ , is anti-correlated with the effective radius, $R _ { e }$ of the clusters. Fig. 3, shows a scatter in the inner slope larger than that observed in DM-only simulations. The scatter is due to the role of the environment as shown in [43]. The anti-correlation is due to the fact that in order total mass have NFW-like profile, clusters having more massive BCGs at their centers must contain less DM in their center. This implies that they must have a flatter DM slope; b) the inner slope of the DM density profile, $\alpha$ and the BCG mass, $M _ { B C G }$ , testifying again that larger content of baryons gives ise to flatter DM profles; c) the virial mass, and the the effective radius,already found in previous studies [66]; d) the mass inside 5 kpc, dominated by baryons,and that inside 1Oo kpc, dominated by DM $^ { 9 }$ ：

The previous correlations led to conclusion, in agreement with [33, 34], that clusters formed from a dissipative phase,steepening the stellar density profile,and a second dissipationless phase in which the DM density profiles flattened because of the "heating” of DM due to interaction with baryonic clumps through DF ([21, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 75].

# 5 Appendix:the model

The model is a semi-analytical model (SAM) intoduced in [17], used in several papers [1,19- 21, 43], and extended in [? ]. The model incorporate a secondary infall model (SIM) [58, 63, 94, 95], that differently from previous SIMs take into acount the effect of DM adiabatic contraction [68, 69, 96], those of random and ordered angular momentum [63, 97],and angular momentum transfer between baryons and DM through dynamical friction [17,19, 36-39, 42].

The model takes into account reionization, cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and AGN feedback (see the following)

The model follows the evolution of a perturbation starting from the linear phase, expanding with the Hubble flow till the phase of maximum expansion (turn-around).

The final density is given by [98, 99]

$$
\rho ( x ) = \frac { \rho _ { t a } ( x _ { m } ) } { f ( x _ { i } ) ^ { 3 } } \left[ 1 + \frac { d \ln f ( x _ { i } ) } { d \ln x _ { m } ( x i ) } \right] ^ { - 1 }
$$

where the term $f ( x _ { i } ) = x / x _ { m } ( x _ { i } )$ is the so called collapse factor (see Eq. A18, DP09). and the turn-around radius with $x _ { \mathrm { m } } ( x _ { \mathrm { i } } )$ ， given by

$$
x _ { \mathrm { m } } = g ( x _ { \mathrm { i } } ) = x _ { \mathrm { i } } \frac { 1 + \bar { \delta } _ { \mathrm { i } } } { \bar { \delta } _ { \mathrm { i } } - ( \Omega _ { \mathrm { i } } ^ { - 1 } - 1 ) } .
$$

In the previous equation, $\Omega _ { \mathrm { i } }$ is the density parameter,and $\overline { { \delta } } _ { \mathrm { i } }$ the average overdensity in a given shell. Our model contains DM and baryons. Initially, baryons are in the gas phase. Baryon fraction is set equal to the "universal baryon fraction” $f _ { \mathrm { b } } = 0 . 1 7 \pm 0 . 0 1$ [56] [0.167 in 2].The baryonic fraction is obtained from the star formation processes described in the following.

In the model, the "ordered angular momentum” $h$ (coming from tidal torques of large scale structures on those on the smallr scales) is obtained through the tidal torque theory (TTT） [97,100-103].

A“random”angular momentum, $j$ , is also present in haloes,and is generated by random velocities (Ryden & Gunn 1987). $j$ is expressed in terms of the eccentricity $\begin{array} { r } { e \ = \ \left( \frac { r _ { \mathrm { m i n } } } { r _ { \mathrm { m a x } } } \right) } \end{array}$ [57]，where $r _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ is the apocentric radius, and $r _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ the pericentric radius. A correction on the eccentricity is made,according to simulations of [58], which consider the effects of the dynamical state of the system on eccentricity

$$
e ( r _ { \mathrm { m a x } } ) \simeq 0 . 8 \left( \frac { r _ { \mathrm { m a x } } } { r _ { \mathrm { t a } } } \right) ^ { 0 . 1 } ,
$$

for $r _ { \mathrm { m a x } } < 0 . 1 r _ { \mathrm { t a } }$

The deceleration term connected to dynamical friction was introduced in the equation of motion (Eq. A14 in DP09). The dynamical friction coefficient was obtained similarly to Antonuccio-Delogu $\&$ Colafrancesco (1994) (see also Appendix D of DP09).

The adiabatic contraction (AC) of DM produced by the baryons collapse was taken into account as follows. Our protostructure is made of baryons and DM, baryonic fraction

$F _ { b } = M _ { b } / M _ { 5 0 0 } < < 1$ ，and DM fraction $1 - F _ { b } ^ { \mathrm { ~ \tiny ~ 1 0 ~ } }$ . Baryons cools and collapse towards the structure center giving rise to a distribution $M _ { b } ( r )$ . DM is compressed, and particles located initially at $r _ { i }$ move to a new position

$$
r \left[ M _ { b } ( r ) + M _ { d m } ( r ) \right] = r _ { i } M _ { i } ( r _ { i } )
$$

(Blumenthal et al. 1986)，being $M _ { i } ( \boldsymbol { r } _ { i } )$ the total mass at initial time,and $M _ { d m }$ the final distribution of DM. One then assumes that baryons and DM have the same initial distribution (Mo et al. 1998; Cardone & Sereno 2005; Treu & Koopmans 2002; Keeton 2001),and that the final baryon distribution is a Hernquist configuration (Rix et al. 1997; Keeton 2001; Treu & Koopmans 2Oo2). If particles orbits do not cross,we have

$$
M _ { d m } ( r ) = ( 1 - F _ { b } ) M _ { i } ( r _ { i } )
$$

Once $M _ { i } ( \boldsymbol { r } _ { i } )$ and $M _ { b } ( r )$ are given, Eqs.(5.4)，(5.5) can be solved to find the final halo distribution. The previous model can be improved assuming that

$$
M ( \bar { r } ) r = \mathrm { c o n s t . }
$$

(Gnedin et al. 2Oo4),namely assuming that the product of the mass in the orbit-averaged radius $r$ with radius conserves. The quantity

$$
\bar { r } = \frac { 2 } { T _ { r } } \int _ { r _ { m i n } } ^ { r _ { m a x } } r \frac { d r } { v _ { r } } ,
$$

is the orbit-averaged radius,and $T _ { r }$ is the radial period.

Gas cooling, star formation, reionization and supernovae feedback were included as done by [104] and [67] (Sect. 2.2.2 and 2.2.3).

Reionization, treated as in [67],reduces the baryon content,and the baryon fraction changes as

$$
f _ { \mathrm { b , h a l o } } ( z , M _ { \mathrm { v i r } } ) = \frac { f _ { \mathrm { b } } } { [ 1 + 0 . 2 6 M _ { \mathrm { F } } ( z ) / M _ { \mathrm { v i r } } ] ^ { 3 } } ,
$$

where $M _ { \mathrm { F } }$ , is the "filtering mass” [see 1O5], and as usual the virial mass is indicated as $M _ { \mathrm { v i r } }$ The reionization redshift is in the range 11.5-15.

Gas cooling is treated as a classical cooling flow [e.g., 106] [see Sect. 2.2.2 of 67]. Simila] results are obtained using the [97] treatment.

The details of star formation are given in [1O4]. The treatment of [1O7] is used for the supernovae feedback. In [108] it was used the blast wave SN feedback (SNF) [109]. For our purposes, the choice of the formalism, even if similar, is not so fundamental. A fundamental difference between our model and the SNF model [e.g.,108] is that in our case the fattening process happens before star formation，and the source of energy is gravitational. Stellar feedback acts when the core is already formed, and disrupts the gas clouds. In the SNFF model the fattening process happens after star formation and the source of energy is stellar feedback.

Concerning these last steps. Gas forms a disc,and the star formation rate is

$$
\psi = 0 . 0 3 M _ { \mathrm { s f } } / t _ { \mathrm { d y n } } \ ,
$$

being ${ t _ { \mathrm { { d y n } } } }$ the disc dynamical time, and $M _ { \mathrm { s f } }$ the gas mass above a given density threshold, （204号 $n > 9 . 3 / c m ^ { 3 }$ as in[108]. The initial mass function (IMF） is a Chabrier one [110]. The amount of stars forming is given by

$$
\Delta M _ { * } = \psi \Delta t ,
$$

where $\Delta t$ indicates the time-step.

The quantity of energy injected by SN in the ISM is

$$
\Delta E _ { \mathrm { S N } } = 0 . 5 \epsilon _ { \mathrm { h a l o } } \Delta M _ { * } V _ { \mathrm { S N } } ^ { 2 } ,
$$

where $V _ { \mathrm { S N } } ^ { 2 } = \eta _ { \mathrm { S N } } E _ { \mathrm { S N } }$ is the energy injected per supernovae and per unit solar mass. The efficiency reheating disc gas efficiency produced by energy is fixed at $\epsilon _ { \mathrm { h a l o } } = 0 . 3 5$ [67]. $\eta _ { \mathrm { S N } } =$ （20 $8 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } / M _ { \odot }$ gives the supernovae number per solar mass obtained assuming a Chabrier IMF [110], and the typical energy released in a SN explosion is $E _ { \mathrm { S N } } = 1 0 ^ { 5 1 }$ erg.

Energy injection in the gas reheats it proportionally to the number of star formed

$$
\Delta M _ { \mathrm { r e h e a t } } = 3 . 5 \Delta M _ { \ast } \ .
$$

The change in thermal energy produced by the reheated gas is given by

$$
\Delta E _ { \mathrm { h o t } } = 0 . 5 \Delta M _ { \mathrm { r e h e a t } } V _ { \mathrm { v i r } } ^ { 2 } ,
$$

This hot gas will be ejected by the halo if $\Delta E _ { \mathrm { S N } } > \Delta E _ { \mathrm { h o t } }$ ,and the quantity is

$$
\Delta M _ { \mathrm { e j e c t } } = \frac { \Delta E _ { \mathrm { S N } } - \Delta E _ { \mathrm { h o t } } } { 0 . 5 V _ { \mathrm { v i r } } ^ { 2 } } .
$$

The halo can accrete the ejected material that becomes part of the hot component related to the central galaxy [1O7,111].

For masses $M \simeq 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } M _ { \odot }$ ， AGN quenching must be taken into account [112]. AGN feedback follows the prescription of [4O? ]. A Super-Massive-Black-Hole (SMBH) is created when the star density exceeds $2 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } M _ { \odot } / \mathrm { k p c } ^ { 3 }$ , the gas density reaches 1O times the stellar density, and the 3D velocity dispersion exceeds $1 0 0 ~ k m / s$ ．Each initial (seed）black hole mass starts at $1 0 ^ { 5 } ~ M _ { \odot }$ . Mass accretion into the SMBH and AGN feedback were implemented modifying the model by [?] as in [40].

The model demonstrated its robustness predicting before simulations the density fattening and shape produced by heating of DM, for galaxies [17, 19, 21] in agreement with subsequent SPH simulations [e.g. 18,113] [see also Fig. 4 of 20,for a direct comparison], and similarly for clusters of galaxies [43] in agreement with hydro-simulations of [41], the inner density slope dependence on the halo mass and on the total baryonic content to the total mass ratio [19,114], in agreement with [108]. The slope was shown by [19,114] to depend also on the angular momentum. In [115], the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher,Faber-Jackson and the stellar mass vs. halo mass (SMH) relations were shown in agreement with simulations.

Finally, the correct DM profile inner slope dependence on halo mass was explained over 6 order of magnitudes in halo mass, from dwarves to clusters[17,19, 21, 43], a range no other model achieved.
