An electrophysiological investigation of the temporal asynchrony effect on characterspeech sound integration in Chinese typically developing children and children with dyslexia

# Research highlights

1. The present study found different neural correlates of character-speech sound integration in the temporal synchrony and temporal asynchrony conditions.   
2. Congruency effects were observed on P1， N17O and N300 components when visual characters were presented synchronously with auditory speech sounds.   
3. Congruency effects were observed on N2Oo component when auditory speech sounds were presented after visual characters by 300 or $6 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$   
4.Dyslexic children showed insufficient character-speech integration in the AV300 condition. Character-speech sound integration deficit in dyslexic readers was modulated by stimulus onset asynchrony.

# Abstract

The neural mechanism of orthographic-phonological integration was influenced by the temporal relationship of cross-modal stimuli. However, previous studies mainly investigated the neural mechanism of letter-speech sound integration in precise temporal synchrony or small temporal asynchrony conditions. In this study, character-speech sound integration was investigated in a relatively wide temporal window. Chinese characters were presented synchronously to the onset of speech sounds or before speech sound by 300 or $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ (referred as AV0, AV300 and AV600). ERP responses evoked by congruent condition (speech sounds were paired with congruent visual characters) and baseline condition (speech sounds were paired with Korean characters) were compared. Different electrophysiological markers were found in the temporal synchrony and temporal asynchrony conditions. In the AV0 condition, developing dyslexia (DD) and typically developing (TD) children showed similar congruency effect on P1，N17O and N30o components，demonstrating the influence of speech sound on visual character processing. In the AV3oo condition, DD group showed left-lateralized congruency effect on N2O0，whereas TD children showed bilateral congruency effect on N2oo. Both groups showed bilateral congruency effect on N2O0 in the AV600 condition. We speculate that the insufficient character-speech sound integration exhibited by dyslexic children in the AV300 condition was probably caused by their slow visual processing speed. The results provide unique insight into the neural mechanism of print-speech integration in a wide temporal window and point out the necessity to investigate neural mechanism of print-speech integration in a relatively wide temporal window.

# 1.Introduction

Reading is essential to children's academic achievement, and is associated with future social and economic success in the literate culture. Although most people acquire literacy skills easily, around $5- 1 0 \%$ of children are affected by developmental dyslexia and suffer from different degrees of reading difficulties (Lyon, Shaywitz, & Shaywitz, 2Oo3). Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a learning disorder characterized by difficulties in accurately and/or fluently reading in spite of an average IQ,adequate schooling, and normal sensory acuity (Lyon, Shaywitz,& Shaywitz, 2oo3). The acquisition of grapheme-phoneme associations is one of the basic requirements for fluent reading and its failure may contribute to reading difficulties in developmental dyslexia (Zari

et al.,2014; Wimmer & Schurz, 2010; Blomert, 2011; Wallace & Stevenson, 2014; Hahn,Foxe,& Molholm, 2O14).Many dyslexia interventions contain a condition focused on letter-speech sound mapping training (Aravena, Snellings, Tijms,&van der Molen, 2013; Tijms & Hoeks,2010). However, the nature and mechanisms involved in orthographic-phonological integration are still unclear (Mercier& Cappe,2020).

One critical factor affecting the success of audiovisual integration is temporal proximity (Calvert, Spence, & Stein,20o4). In an fMRI study, van Atteveldt, Formisano, Blomert and Goebel (2Oo7) investigated the effect of temporal asynchrony on letter-speech sound integration. In their study, a heteromodal area in superior temporal sulsuc (STS) and a modality-specific auditory association cortex were identified to be involved in letter-speech sound integration. The STS receives visual information and auditory information. Visual letters influenced the processing of speech sounds by sending feedback from STS to the auditory association cortex (van Atteveldt, Formisano, Blomert & Goebel, 2007). Most interestingly, integration (stronger BOLD response to congruent letter-sound pairs than to incongruent lettersound pairs) in the left STS occurred within a relatively wide temporal window (about $3 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ ), whereas integration in auditory association areas depended on temporal synchrony. The findings provided evidence for the influence of temporal asynchrony on letter-speech sound integration.

Although fMRI studies provide insight about precise localization of the neural mechanisms involved in letter-speech sound integration, they cannot provide precise temporal information of the processing. Precise neural time course of letter-speech sound integration can only be investigated with a high temporal resolution method such as event-related potentials (ERP). To date, only a few studies have investigated the effect of temporal asynchrony on letter-speech sound integration using ERP technique. Most of the studies used the mismatch negativity (MMN) as an index of automatic letter-speech integration. The MMN is evoked between 10O and $2 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$ after stimulus onset and is considered to reflect the neurophysiological correlate of a comparison process between an incoming deviant auditory stimulus and the memory trace of repeatedly presented standard auditory stimulus (Schröger, 1998).

Froyen, Van Atteveldt, Bonte and Blomert (20o8) recorded EEG data while healthy Dutch adult readers completed a passive oddball task in which speech sounds (standard, $90 \%$ ; deviant, $10 \%$ ), letter/speech sound pairs (the visually presented letter was always an $^ { \mathrm { 6 6 } } \mathrm { a } ^ { \mathrm { 7 } }$ , irrespective of the speech sound) were presented. The stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) between the presentation of the letter and speech sound were manipulated, including synchronous condition (AVO) and two visual-leading auditory conditions (100 or $2 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ , referred to as AV100 or AV200 from here on). Compared with the MMN in isolated auditory condition, larger MMN amplitude

(reflecting integration) in audiovisual condition was only found in the AVO condition. Likewise, Mittag and colleagues (2011, 2013) found enhanced MMN amplitude in healthy adult readers in the AVO condition but not in the AV2O0 condition. The results in children were slightly different. When investigated SOA effects on letter-speech sound integration in typically developing (TD) children, Froyen, Bonte, Van Atteveldt and Blomert (20o9) did not find enhanced MMN amplitude in the AV0 condition, but found enhance MMN amplitude in the AV2O0 condition. The authors explained the MMN as reflecting a mature and automatic cross-modal integration. The absence of enhanced MMN in the AVO condition indicated that automatic print-speech integration has not been fully developed in the children. Employing an adapted version of the oddball paradigm of Froyen and colleagues (2008,2009,2011), Zari

and colleges (2014) examined SOA effects on letter-speech sound integration in   
three groups of children (typical readers, dysfluent dyslexics, and severe dysfluent   
dyslexics). In the AVO condition, enhanced MMN amplitudes were observed both in   
typical readers and in dysfluent dyslexics. In the AV2O0 condition, enhanced MMN   
amplitudes were found in all groups. The authors attributed the different findings   
between their study and studies by Froyen and colleagues (20o9, 2011) to the   
methodological differences such as proportion of deviants (increased from $10 \%$ （204号   
or $1 5 \%$ to $1 7 \%$ ） and trial length (increased from $1 2 5 0 \mathrm { m s }$ to $1 7 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } } ^ { \cdot }$ (Zari et al., 2014).

Taken together, the aforementioned studies reveal interactions between temporal proximity and experimental parameters in the MMN integration effect, indicating that temporal synchrony or small temporal asynchrony is critical for the integration effect reflected by MMN. According to brain imaging studies, the major MMN source is located in the early auditory cortex (Alho,1995; Giard,Perrin,Pernier & Bouchet,

2010), including the auditory association cortex which is reported to be dependent on temporal synchrony (van Atteveldt, Formisano, Blomert & Goebel, 2O07). The dependence of temporal synchrony in MMN integration effects observed in the ERP studies resembles that in the auditory association cortex observed in the fMRI study by van Atteveldt, Formisano, Blomert and Goebel (2007). In that case, it is reasonable to speculate that MMN is not suitable for investigating the neural mechanism of multisensory integration at a relatively wide temporal window. However, letter-speech sound integration can occur at relatively long temporal asynchronies (Nash et al, 2016; Clayton & Hulme, 2017; Hasko, Bruder, Bartling & Schulte-Körne, 2012). It is necessary to describe a whole temporal profile for the neural mechanisms of letterspeech integration using other electrophysiological markers.Moreover, letter-speech integration includes multiple processing stages. In the fMRI study by van Atteveldt, Formisano, Blomert and Goebel (2007) and the ERP studies by Froyen and colleagues (2008, 2009, 2011), the neural correlates of integration only reflected the influence of visual letter on speech processing. The influence of speech sound on visual stimuli was not illustrated. In the study by Froyen, van Atteveldt and Blomert (2O1O), visual MMN was used to investigate the influence of speech sound on letter processing but no visual MMN amplitude modulation was found. Exploring letter-speech sound integration with other electrophysiological signatures provides an opportunity to reveal both sides of letter-speech sound integration.

Under these circumstances, the first aim of the current study was to explore the neural mechanisms of print-speech integration across a wide range of temporal asynchrony using electrophysiological correlates that are less dependent on temporal synchrony. Compared with typical readers,dyslexic readers have been reported to show broader temporal integration window for both speech and non-speech stimuli (Laasonen, Service,& Virsu, 2002; Virsu, Lahti-Nuuttila,& Laasonen, 20o3; Hairston et al.,2005; Wallace & Stevenson, 2014; Meilleur, Foster, Coll, Brambati, & Hyde, 2020). The second aim of this study was to examine whether dyslexic children exhibit different neural mechanisms of letter-speech sound integration from typically developing children.To this end, Chinese dyslexic children and nondyslexic children were recruited as participants. In the present study, three levels of SOA were included: synchronous condition (AVO), visual leading auditory stimuli by 300 ms (AV300), and visual leading auditory stimuli by $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ (AV600). We chose O and $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ SOA since these SOAs have been proved to be effective and used in the study by van Atteveldt, Formisano, Blomert and Goebel (2007). We chose the 600 ms SOA because it is close to the 50O ms SOA used in the study by Clayton and Hulme (2017) and is shorter than the 1000 ms SOA used in the study by Nash et al. (2016). High temporal resolution event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to measure the real time printspeech integration processing in all SOA conditions. ERP waveforms induced by the onset of auditory stimuli were analyzed.

# 2.Method

# 2.1. Participants

Thirty children between the ages of 9 and 11 were recruited from primary schools in Beijing. The children were in grade 3 to 6. There were 14 children with developing dyslexia (DD: 4 females and 10 males, mean age was 10.10 years) and 16 typically developing children as controls (TD: 5 females and 1l males, mean age was 10.29 years). Al participants were right-handed with Chinese as their native language, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and did not report a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Two participants in the control group and one in the dyslexic group were excluded in the following ERP analysis because of the excessive artifacts. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Psychology Chinese Academy of Science. Prior to the experiment, written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of the children.

The inclusion criteria for selecting children with dyslexia were adopted from the studies conducted with Mandarin-speaking Chinese participants (Meng, Cheng-Lai, Zeng, Stein,& Zhou, 2011; Wang, Bi, Gao,& Wydell, 2010). Intelligence quotient (IQ) and vocabulary size were assessed by Combined Raven's Progressive Matrices Test (CRT) (Li, Chen, & Jin, 1989) and Chinese Character Recognition Test (CCRT) (Wang & Tao, 1996),respectively. In Combined Raven's Test, nonverbal intelligence was tested by a series of matrices with increasing difficulty.In Chinese Character Recognition Test, 210 characters are divided into 10 sub-groups according to levels of difficulty. The participants were required to write down a compound word using a given Chinese character. For example,if they see the character 草(grass), they should write down a compound word such as 草地 (grassland),草坪 (grass-plot), ect. The raw score for each sub-group multiplied a coefficient corresponding to the difficulty level, and then the scores for the ten sub-groups were summed up for each participant. Those individuals with normal IQ $( \mathrm { I Q } > 8 5 ) \$ ） and low score in CCRT (at least one and a half standard deviations below the average score of typically developing children in the same grade) were recruited as dyslexic participants in this study.

# 2.2. Reading-related Measures

Prior to the ERP experiment, both groups of children participated in a series of linguistic-cognitive tests, including reading fluency, reading accuracy, morphological awareness, phonological awareness, rapid naming, short-term memory, and visual spatial attention. The detailed information of the participants is presented in Table 1.

# Reading fluency test

This test was developed by Qian,Deng, Zhao,and Bi (2015) which includes a fixed list of 160 high frequency (233.71 occurrence per million) Chinese characters that were selected from the Modern Chinese Frequency Dictionary (1986). The children were required to read aloud each character as fluently and accurately as they can within 1 min. The number of correctly read words was recorded to represent their reading fluency score.

# Reading accuracy test

A list of 172 characters with increasing difficulty (i.e., increasing stroke numbers and decreasing word frequency) was presented on a paper. Participants were asked to read each character aloud in sequence.When the participant failed to correctly read five characters consecutively, the test was terminated. Participants were scored on the total number of correctly read characters.

# Morphological awareness test

A morpheme judgment task similar to that in Shu, Mcbride-Chang,Wu, and Liu (2006) was used in this study. The test contains 2O pairs of two-character Chinese words. Each pair of words shared one character (e.g.， 等级 vs.等待,meaning level vs. wait). Participants were asked to judge whether the identical characters in the pairs had the same meaning, i.e., whether the identical characters represent the same morpheme or not. One point was scored for each correct judgment.

# Phonological awareness task

Phonological awareness was measured by an oddball paradigm adopted from Qian and Bi (2015). There were three subtests corresponding to three types of oddity, which were onset, rime and lexical tone respectively. There were ten trials for each type of oddity. In each trial, three Chinese characters were presented orally by the

experimenter. Participants were required to identify the phonologically odd item among them. One point was scored for each correct judgment.

# Rapid automatized naming task (RAN)

This task was adapted from Denckla and Rudel (1976). RAN was measured by two subtests including picture naming and digit naming. Five pictures (e.g., flower, book, dog, hand, shoe) or five digits (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) were presented repeatedly in random order in a six row $\cdot \times$ five column grid. The children were instructed to name each picture or digit in sequence as quickly as possible.All items were read twice. Naming latencies were recorded with a stopwatch and the final score was the average time of the two readings. The higher score means the slower speed of naming.

# Short-term memory task

The WAIS- III (Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale version II, Wechsler, 1997) subtest was used. The test has two parts: forward memory and backward memory. In forward memory subtest, the children were presented with a list of numbers and then asked to repeat them sequentially. In backward memory subtest, the children were presented with a list of numbers and required to repeat the numbers in reverse order. The number of test items increases gradually. When the children made two consecutive mistakes, the test will stop. The largest correct number was taken as the final score.

# Visual spatial attention

A digit cancellation task was used to test the visual spatial attention (see Takeshi, Kazuhito, Yasuhiro, Mitsuhito,& Hidehiro, 2013). Numbers from O to 9 were repeatedly presented in a $2 5 \mathrm { r o w s } \times 4 0$ columns matrix. Participants were instructed to search through the matrix and deleted the number “3” sequentially in three minutes. The visual spatial attention ability is measured as ‘correct number-(false number $+$

$0 . 5 \times$ missed number)'. The higher score means the better visual spatial attention ability.

# 2.3. Stimuli and Procedure

A passive priming task adapted from the study by Nash and colleagues (2016) was employed in this experiment. There were six experimental conditions: bimodal congruent at 3 SOAs (AV0, AV300, and AV600) and bimodal baseline at 3 SOAs. In the congruent condition, the prime was a visually presented Chinese single character and the target was the corresponding speech sound. In the baseline condition, the prime was a visually presented Korean character and the target was a Chinese speech sound. Speech sounds were recorded by a female native Chinese speaker and digitally converted to 16-bit resolution at a sampling rate of $4 4 . 1 \mathrm { k H z }$ . The mean duration of speech sound was 426.04 ms (SD $\circleddash$ 111.13).Visual stimuli consist of 80 Chinese single characters and 8O stroke-matched Korean characters. Korean characters were used for non-word symbols as they are unfamiliar to the children in this study.

The priming task was run using E-prime version 2.0 (Schneider, et al. 2002). A schematic description of stimuli presentation is shown in Figure 1. At the beginning of each trial, a central fixation was presented for 5OO ms. Next a black visual character appeared on a white screen for $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ . The characters were written in Song font size 72.They were presented on a 17 inch screen and the children sat $7 0 \mathrm { c m }$ from the screen. The auditory stimuli were presented over headphones simultaneously with the visual characters or after a $3 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ or $6 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$ time delay. A blank screen with a random interval from 5OO to 1000 ms was presented after the offset of the visual characters.Participants were instructed to look at the characters and listen to the sounds. Catch trials were included to ensure that the children were attending to the stimuli during the task. In the catch trial, children were required to press the spacebar when they saw a yellow cartoon picture. There are 5 blocks in the formal experiment, each block contains 96 experimental trials and 16 catch trials.There are 56O trials in total. The duration of formal experiment is about $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ (break time was not included). Before formal experiment started, a practice session including 20 trials was presented to the children to familiarize with the experimental procedure.

# 2.4.EEG recording and ERP analysis

Using 64-channel electrode cap (NeuroScan II Inc., EI Paso, TX, USA), EEG data were collected in a quiet and dimly-light room. Electrodes were positioned according to the Extended International 1O-2O System. The channels were referenced to left mastoid. In addition, four bipolar electrodes were used to record vertical and horizontal eye blinks. EEG data were sampled at $1 0 0 0 \mathrm { H z }$ and bandpass filtered from $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { H z }$ to $1 0 0 \mathrm { H z }$ online. Electrode impedance levels were kept below $5 \mathrm { k } \Omega$

The raw data were processed offline using EEGLAB (Delorme and Makeig, 2003; http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab). Data were re-referenced to the average of the 64 electrodes and bandpass filtered from $0 . 1 \mathrm { H z }$ to $4 0 \mathrm { H z }$ . An independent component analysis (ICA) was run on the pre-processed data in order to reduce artifacts caused by eye movement or body motion. Then the EEG data were segmented into epochs that began from 1OO ms before the onset of the auditory stimuli and ended $7 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$ after the onset of the auditory stimuli. The $1 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$ interval before stimuli onset was used as baseline. Epochs were rejected if amplitudes exceeded $\pm 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { V } .$ The mean number of accepted epochs for each condition and group are illustrated in Table 2. Epochs were averaged for each condition and each group. Catch trials were not analyzed. The layout for configuration of electrodes and selection of electrodes for data analysis were shown in Figure 2. Mixed-design ANOVAs with Greenhouse

Geisser correction were applied to analyze the ERP data. The alpha level for all analyses was 0.05.

# 3. Results

# 3.1 Synchronous audiovisual condition (AV0)

Grand-average ERPs in response to the simultaneous onset of visual and auditory stimuli for all conditions and groups are plotted in Figure 3 for representative electrodes. The occipito-temporal P1, N170,and fronto-temporal N300 were observed in the AVO condition.

P1

Peak latency was measured in the time window of 10o-18O ms and averaged amplitude was measured in a $4 0 \mathrm { m s }$ time window centered on the peak latency. Mixed-design ANOVAs with Greenhouse-Geisser correction were performed on the latency and amplitude of P1, with group as between-subject factor, and trial type (congruent, baseline),laterality (left hemisphere: P7, PO7, PO5,and right hemisphere: P8,PO8,PO6) as within-subject factors.For the P1 latency, the interaction between trial type and laterality was significant $( F ( 1 , 2 5 ) = 7 . 3 6 , p = . 0 1 2 ,$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 2 7 ,$ . P1 latency was marginally longer in congruent condition in comparison to baseline condition on the left hemisphere (141 vs.134 ms, $t ( 2 6 ) = 2 . 0 1$ ， $p = . 0 5 5 )$ .No difference was found in the P1 latencies between the two conditions on the right hemisphere (138 vs. 139 ms, $t ( 2 6 ) = - 0 . 4 9 6$ , $p = . 6 2 4 )$ . No significant effect was found for the P1 amplitude.

N170

The N170 peak latency was measured in the time window of 180-250 ms, mean N170 amplitude was measured by the average of a $4 0 \mathrm { m s }$ time window centered on the peak latency. Mixed-design ANOVAs with Greenhouse-Geisser correction were performed on the latency and amplitude of N170, with group as between-subject factor, and trial type (congruent, baseline), laterality (left hemisphere: P7, PO7,PO5, and right hemisphere: P8, PO8, PO6) as within-subject factors. Significant main effect of trial type was found for N17O latency, $( F ( 1 , 2 5 ) = 6 . 2 2 , p = . 0 2$ ， $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 9 9 )$ . In comparison to baseline condition, congruent condition induced longer N17O latency (212 vs. 206 ms, $t ( 2 6 ) = 2 . 5 1 , p = . 0 1 9 )$ . For the N170 amplitude, the main effect of trial type is significant ( $( F ( 1 , 2 5 ) = 8 . 0 6$ ， $p = . 0 0 9$ ， $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 4 4 )$ . When compared with baseline, congruent trials evoked larger N170 amplitude $( - 2 . 5 4 \mathrm { v s . } - 1 . 2 8 \mu \mathrm { V } )$ . The main effect of laterality is marginally significant $( ( F 1 , 2 5 ) = 4 . 1 4 , p = . 0 5 3 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 4 2$ with greater N170 amplitude on the left hemisphere $( - 2 . 8 8 \mathrm { v s . } \partial . 9 3 \mathrm { \textmu V } )$ . The main effect of group is significant $( F ( 1 , 2 5 ) = 6 . 5 2 , p = . 0 1 7$ ， $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 0 7 \$ ), with larger N170 amplitude in the TD group $( - 3 . 6 7 \ \mathrm { v s . } \ - 0 . 1 5 \ \mu \mathrm { V } )$ . No significant interaction was found for N170.

# N300

N300 was broadly distributed in the fronto-temporal area in the AVO condition. The mean amplitude of N300 was measured in a 260-340 ms time window. Mixeddesign ANOVAs with Greenhouse-Geisser correction were performed on the average N300 amplitude, with group as between-subject factor, and trial type (congruent, baseline),laterality (left hemisphere: F7, F5, F3, midline: FP1/2, FPZ, AF3/4, F1/2, FZ,and right hemisphere: F8,F6, F4) as within-subject factors. The main effect of trial type is significant $( F ( 1 , 2 5 ) = 2 7 . 2 8 , p < . 0 0 1$ 0 $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 5 2 2 \$ ),with largerN300 amplitude in the baseline condition $( - 4 . 5 5 \mathrm { v s . } - 6 . 8 3 \mathrm { \textmu V } )$ . The main effect of laterality is significant $( F ( 2 , 5 0 ) = 3 . 6 3 , p = . 0 3 4 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 2 7 ,$ . In comparison to the right hemisphere, the N3oO amplitude was larger on the midline $( - 6 . 0 4 \mathrm { v s . } - 4 . 9 \mu \mathrm { V } , t ( 2 6 ) =$ 2.3, $p = . 0 3 )$ . No other significant main effect or interaction was significant.

# 3.2 AV300 condition

Grand-average ERPs in response to the onset of auditory stimuli for all conditions and groups are plotted in Figure 4 for representative electrodes.A frontotemporal negativity peaked around 2OO ms was found in the AV3oO condition. The mean N200 amplitude was measured in a 170-230 ms time window. Mixed-design ANOVAs with Greenhouse-Geisser correction were performed on the average N200 amplitude, with group as between-subject factor, and trial type (congruent, baseline), laterality (left hemisphere: F7,F5, FT7, FC5, midline: AF3,FP1, FP2,FPZ,AF4, and right hemisphere: F6,F8,FC6,FT8) as within-subject factors. The main effect of trial type was significant $( F ( 1 , 2 4 ) = 1 9 . 7 8 , p < . 0 0 1 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 4 5 \$ , with greater amplitude in the congruent condition $( - 6 . 8 3 \ \mathrm { v s . } \ - 4 . 5 5 \mu \mathrm { V } )$ . The main effect of laterality was significant $( F ( 2 , 4 8 ) = 1 8 . 1 9 , p < . 0 0 1 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 4 3 1 )$ ), with largest amplitude on the midline $( p s < . 0 0 1 )$ . There is no difference between the amplitudes on the left hemisphere and right hemisphere. The interaction of trial type, laterality and group was significant $( F ( 2 , 4 8 ) = 3 . 2 9 , p = . 0 4 6 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 2$ ). Follow-up ANOVAs showed significant group effect $( F ( 1 , 2 4 ) = 4 . 2 9 , p = . 0 4 9 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 5 1 )$ and interaction between trial type and group $( F ( 1 , 2 4 ) = 4 . 7 7 , p = . 0 3 9 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 6 6 )$ on the right hemisphere. In comparison to the DD group, the TD group showed larger N2O0 amplitude on the right hemisphere $( - 2 . 6 5 \mathrm { v s . } - 0 . 5 2 \mu \mathrm { V } )$ . Furthermore, for the TD group, congruent trials evoked larger N2O0 amplitude as compared with baseline on the right hemisphere (- $3 . 5 0 \ \mathrm { v s . } \ - 1 . 8 0 \ \mu \mathrm { V } , \ t ( 1 2 ) = - 3 . 6 9 , p = . 0 0 3 )$ . But no difference was found in the amplitudes between the two conditions for DD group.

# 3.3 AV600 condition

Grand-average ERPs in response to the onset of auditory stimuli for all conditions are plotted in Figure 5 for representative electrodes. Similar as in the AV300 condition, a fronto-temporal N2O0 was found in the AV6o0 condition. Mean amplitude of N200 was measured in a 150-250 ms time window. Mixed-design ANOVAs with Greenhouse-Geisser correction were performed on the average amplitude, with group as between-subject factor, and trial type (congruent, baseline), laterality (left hemisphere: F7, F5, FT7, FC5,and right hemisphere: F6, F8, FC6, FT8)as within-subject factors. The main effect of trial type was significant $( F ( 1 , 2 4 ) =$ 9.02, $p = . 0 0 6$ ， $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 7 3 )$ . In comparison to baseline, congruent condition evoked larger N200 amplitude $( - 1 . 2 5 \mathrm { v s . } \mathsf { - 0 . 1 2 \mu V } )$ . The main effect of group was significant $( F ( 1 , 2 4 ) = 5 . 5 2 , p = . 0 2 7 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 5 )$ , with larger amplitude in the TD group (-1.52 vs. $0 . 1 4 \mu \mathrm { V } )$ . No other significant effect was found.

# 3.4 Relationships between the measures of integration effect and reading-related skills

To further investigate whether the congruency effects (differences between ERP amplitudes in the congruent and baseline conditions) correlate with individual reading-related skills, we calculated partial correlation coeficients (controlling for age,IQ,and vocabulary size) between congruency effect and scores of reading skills in the total population (both groups, adopting two-tailed significance level of ${ \mathfrak { a } } =$ 0.05) and in each group (adopting two-tailed significance level of $\mathtt { a } = 0 . 0 5$ ） separately. Since the present study focuses on the SOA effect on audiovisual integration in different groups, we present analyses separately for the TD and DD groups.

In the AVU condition, ditterent correlations were tound in the two groups. In the TD group, the congruency effect on Plamplitude was strongly correlated with reading fluency $( r = . 6 7 , p = . 0 1 2 )$ and RAN $( r = . 6 6 , p = . 0 1 1 )$ on the right hemisphere. The congruency effect on P1 latency was significantly correlated with reading accuracy ( $r$ $= . 6 1 3 , p = . 0 4 4 )$ on the right hemisphere. For the congruency effects on P1 amplitude or latency, positive values reflected greater congruency effects. The correlation coefficient between congruency effect on P1 amplitude and reading fluency, between congruency effect on P1 latency and reading accuracy were positive, indicating that a larger congruency effect was associated with higher reading fluency and reading accuracy. The correlation coefficient between congruency effect on P1 amplitude and RAN was negative, indicating that a larger congruency effect was associated with higher naming speed (smaller scores in RAN test). The correlation between the congruency effect on N3o0 amplitude and visual spatial attention was significant on the right hemisphere $( r = . 6 1 3 , p = . 0 4 4 )$ . For the congruency effects on N300 amplitude, positive values reflected greater congruency effects. The positive correlation coeficient means that a larger congruency effect was associated with higher visual spatial attention capacity. In the DD group, significant correlation was found between the congruency effect on P1 latency and morphological awareness ( $\overset { \cdot } { r } =$ .662, $p = . 0 3 7 \mathrm { _ { \it { 1 } } }$ ） on the right hemisphere, suggesting that greater congruency effect was associated with better morphological awareness. A significant correlation was found between the congruency effect on N300 amplitude and RAN ( ${ ( r = . 7 0 7 }$ $p = . 0 2 2 )$ on the right hemisphere. Since larger scores in RAN test means lower naming speed, the positive correlation coefficient between congruency effect on N3oo amplitude and RAN reflecting that greater congruency effect was associated with slower naming speed.

In the AV3o0 condition, the correlation between the congruency effect on N200 amplitude and RAN was strong and significant ( $_ { \tiny { r } } = . 6 8 6$ $p = . 0 2 8 ^ { \cdot }$ ）on the left hemisphere. For the congruency effects on N2O0 amplitude, negative values reflected greater congruency effects. The positive correlation coefficient between congruency effect on N2OO amplitude and rapid naming means that the greater congruency effect was associated with higher naming speed. In the DD group, the correlation between the congruency effect on N2Oo amplitude and visual spatial attention was significant $( r = . 6 5 , p = . 0 4 2 )$ on the left hemisphere.The negative correlation coefficient between congruency effect on N2O0 amplitude and visual spatial attention in the DD group means that the greater congruency effect was associated with higher visual spatial attention capacity. No significant correlation was found between the congruency effect on N2O0 amplitude and reading-related skills for both groups in the AV600 condition.

# 4.Discussion

The current study investigated electrophysiological correlates of cross-modal character-speech sound processing in developmental dyslexia and typically developing children in different SOA conditions.Different neural correlates were found in the temporal synchrony and temporal asynchrony conditions. Congruency effects were found for both groups across all the three SOAs.Difference in congruency effects between the DD and TD children was only found on the right hemisphere in the AV3o0 condition, where TD children exhibited significant congruency effect and children with dyslexia did not. The main findings are discussed in turn below.

# 4.1 Electrophysiological indices of congruency effects in the AVo condition

In the AVO condition, the concurrently presented stimuli induced P1 and N170 components in the occipito-temporal area and N30O in the fronto-temporal area. Congruent trials induced longer P1 latency, longer N17O latency and larger N170 amplitude in comparison to baseline. The P1 component has been linked with physical characteristic of stimuli and selective attention (Hillyard, Teder-Sälejärvi & Minte,1998). The N17O was associated with the activity of visual word form area and was sensitive to orthographic information (Cohen et al., 20o0; Sehyr, Midgley, Holcomb,Emmorey, & Behrmann, 202O). The increased latencies of P1 and N170 have been linked to a delay in visual processing speed (Bieniek, Frei,& Rousselet, 2013), suggesting that the large sensory processing load in the early stage of audiovisual integration will slow down the visual processing speed. We speculated that the greater N17O amplitude indicates increased cognitive processing load and more orthographic processing effort.As P1 and N170 reflect early processing of visual stimuli, the observed congruency effects on P1 and N17O reflect the influence of speech sound on visual character processing,but not the influence of visual character on speech sound processing.

A fronto-temporal N3oO congruency effect was found in a later stage, with congruent trials inducing smaller N3o0 amplitude in comparison to baseline. The latency and distribution of N300 resemble previously reported N300 in tasks requiring access to phonological representations of visual words (Bentin, Mouchetant-Rostaing, Giard, Echallier, & Pernier, 1999; Spironelli & Angrilli,2007). In children, N300 was found to be associated with the integration of orthographic and phonological representations over the fronto-temporal lobe (Penolazzi, Spironelli, Vio,& Angrilli, 2006). Lower N300 amplitude in congruent condition was thought to reflect successful perceptual integration or the access of mental representation (Male &

Gouldthorp, 2020), which was consistent with the finding on N300 congruency effect in this study. In the study by Hasko, Bruder, Bartling and Schulte-Körne (2012), auditory stimuli were presented before visual word, left-lateralized word-speech integration on N3oO was found in TD children and bilateral word-speech integration on N300 was found in DD group. Such left-lateralized N3o0 congruency effect was not found in the present study, probably because visual characters and speech sounds were presented synchronously in the AVO condition. The difference demonstrates the important influence of temporal asynchrony on the neural mechanism of print-speech sound integration.

# 4.2 Electrophysiological indices of congruency effects in the AV3oo and AV600 conditions

In the AV3oO and AV6oo conditions, auditory speech sounds induced a frontotemporal N2Oo component. In both conditions, congruent trials induced larger N200 amplitudes in comparison to baseline. The N2Oo component has been related to several functional mechanisms, such as working memory processes (Sams,1983), the acquisition of implicit knowledge (Tatiana et al., 2O14), selective pre-attentive stimulus evaluation and stimulus discrimination (Howe, 2014; Polich, 2007). In children, fronto-central N2O0 responses induced by auditory stimulus are thought to represent encoding of acoustic properties in both primary and secondary auditory cortices (Ponton, Eggermont, Kwong,& Don, 20o0). We tentatively speculate that the N200 component may reflect online encoding of acoustic information since it was induced by the onset of auditory speech sound.

In the AV3oo condition, dyslexic children revealed congruency effect over left fronto-temporal electrode sites, whereas TD group revealed bilaterally distributed congruency effect. This difference may be caused by the well-documented visual perceptual difficulties (Cornelissen, Hansen, Hutton, Evangelinou, & Stein, 1998; Livingstone,Rosen, Drislane,& Galaburda, 1991) or auditory perceptual difficulties (Helenius, Uutela,& Hari, 1999) in dyslexic readers.Numerous studies have indicated that dyslexics exhibited a visual processing difficulty, particularly in rapid visual temporal processing (Lovegrove, Slaghuis, Bowling, Nelson, & Geeves,1986). Specifically, dyslexic readers exhibited an asymmetric sluggish attention capture in the left visual field (Facoetti & Molteni, 2001; Jaskowski & Rusiak,2008), which may result in insufficient visual processing of character on the right hemisphere. The insufficient character processing in turn contributed to the absence of N200 congruency effect on the right hemisphere in DD group. Another possible reason for the absence of N200 congruency effect on the right hemisphere in dyslexic children may be their asymmetrical deficit in auditory processing. Previous data have shown reduced phase entrainment by the dyslexic participants in right hemisphere auditory networks (Cutini, Szücs, Mead, Huss, & Goswami, 2016), and impaired neuro-electric oscillations in Theta and Delta band on the right hemisphere (Goswami, 2011). Such deficits may explain the weak N2OO response on the right hemisphere in dyslexic children.

Multisensory integration starts from the cross-modal inputs to sensory cortices (Cappe, Thut, Romei, & Murray, 2010; Mercier & Cappe, 2020).As each sensory system has its own processing speed (Breznitz, 20o6), the gap between visual processing speed and auditory processing speed may affect the quality of integration (Shaul, 2014). In the AV6o0 condition, the temporal disparity between visual characters and speech sounds was relatively long, allowing the dyslexic children to process visual characters more sufficiently, thus leading to equivalent N200 congruency effects on both hemispheres. In the AV3o0 and AV600 conditions, the congruency effects on N2OO reflect the influence of visual characters on the processing of speech sounds.In the AV300 and AV600 conditions, different findings on the laterality of N2OO congruency effect were found in dyslexic children, demonstrating the important influence of visual information on speech sound processing.

# 4.3 Relationships between the neural correlates of congruency effects and reading skills

The relationships between neural correlates of congruency effects and behavioral measures of reading-related skills were different in the two groups. In the AVO and AV300 conditions, reading-related skills correlated with the congruency effects in expected direction in TD children, with beter readers showing greater congruency effects. In the AVO condition, RAN correlated with N3o0 congruency effect in the opposite direction in dyslexic children, suggesting the greatest congruency effect for the poorest readers. The TD children revealed significant correlation between visual spatial attention and congruency in the AVO condition, whereas dyslexic children revealed significant correlation between visual spatial attention and congruency effect in the AV3o0 condition. The slow involvement of visual spatial attention may confirm a deficit in attention capture in dyslexic children (Facoetti & Molteni, 2001; Jaskowski & Rusiak, 2Oo8). No significant correlation between reading-related skills and congruency effect was found in the AV6oO condition, suggesting that the influence of reading-related skills on neural congruency effects depends on the temporal relationship between cross-modal stimuli. In general, the neural correlates of congruency effects can index reading-related skills in TD children.But the relationships between reading-related skills and the neural correlates of congruency effect in dyslexic children were more complicated.

# 4.4 Limitations of the present study

Lastly, it is important to point out possible limitations of our study. One limitation is the small sample size of the subgroups. In future, the study should be repeated with a larger sample size in order to gain power and to assess whether the results are replicable and powerful. The second limitation is that only the influence of speech sounds on processing of visual characters was observed in the AVO condition. The ERP responses may be visual-dominant in the passive viewing and listening task, future study should employ an active task to direct participant's attention to the speech sounds.

# Conclusion

The present study found different neural correlates of character-speech sound integration in the temporal synchrony and temporal asynchrony conditions. Congruency effects on P1, N170 and N30O reflect the influence of speech sound on visual character processing in the AVO condition. Congruency effects on N2Oo in the AV300 and AV6oo conditions reflect the influence of visual character on speech sound processing. Compared with TD children, dyslexic children showed insuficient character-speech integration in the AV3oO condition, suggesting that character-speech sound integration deficit in dyslexic readers was modulated by the temporal relationships between visual and auditory stimuli.

Figure 1. Schematic description of the experimental design. (A) Shows an example of cross-modal stimuli pairs in congruent and baseline conditions. Visual stimuli were either written Chinese characters or Korean symbols.Auditory stimuli were pronunciations of a Chinese character. (B) Ilustrates the stimulus sequences within an experimental trial. Each trial starts with a central fixation presenting for $5 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$

followed by a visual stimulus with the duration of 10oO ms.Auditory stimulus was presented synchronously or after a $3 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ or $6 0 0 \mathrm { { m s } }$ time interval. The visual stimulus was followed by a random blank interval of 50o-1000 ms.

Figure 3. Grand average ERPs and topographic graphs in response to the auditory onset under the AVO condition. Multisensory integrations were involved in the time windows of 110-180 ms,180-250 ms,and 260-340 ms. The early P1 and N170 can be observed on PO7/8 electrodes, and fronto-temporal N300 can be observed on the AF3/4 electrodes.
