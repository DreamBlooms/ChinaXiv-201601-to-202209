Type linterferon (IFN-l) is criticalfora host against viral and bacterialinfections via induction of hundreds ofinterferon-stimulated genes (ISGs),butthe mechanism underlying the regulation of IFN-l remains largely unknown.Inthis study,we firstdemonstrate that ISG expresion is required foroptimal IFN ${ \bf \cdot } { \bf \ \ } | \ B { \bf \cdot } { \bf \ \ } | | \ B { \bf \cdot } { \bf \nabla } | | ^ { 2 }$ levels,an effect that is further enhanced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.Furthermore, we identify mitochondrial calcium uniporter protein (MCU)asa mitochondrialantiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-interacting protein that is important for ER stress induction and amplified MAVS signaling activation.In addition,by performing an ectopic expressionassay to screen a library of117 human ISGs for effects on IFN ${ \bf \cdot } { \bf \ \ } | \ B { \bf \cdot } { \bf \ \ } | | \ B { \bf \cdot } { \bf \nabla } | | ^ { 2 }$ levels, we found that tumor necrosis factor receptor1(TNFR1) significantly increases IFN- ${ \bf \cdot } { \bf \ \ } | \ B { \bf \cdot } { \bf \ \ } | | \ B { \bf \cdot } { \bf \nabla } | | ^ { 2 }$ levels independent of ER stress.Altogether, our findings suggest that MCU and TNFR1 are involved in the regulation of RIG-l-like receptors (RLR) signaling.

The robust and rapid inductionof IFN-I is important forahost inprotectionagainst viralandbacterial infections1.Upon infection with an RNA virus,virus-related molecules are recognized by retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation asociated gene 5 (MDA-5),two receptors of theRIG-I-like receptor(RLR)pathway,ladingto the productionofIFN-I in most celltypes. Upon activation,RIG-Ior MDA5 binds to its adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS,also referred to as IPS-1,VISAor Cardif) via CARD-CARD domain interaction. MAVS complexes then activate IFN-I by facilitating the nuclear translocation of $\mathrm { I R F } 3 ^ { 2 - 5 }$ .The induction ofIFN-Ibythe RLR pathway further regulates hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by binding to interferon- $\alpha / \beta$ receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and activating downstream signaling7.However, despite decades of intensive studies,the precise mechanisms by which cellular IFN-Iis robustly and rapidly induced have remained obscure.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane-bound compartment that is important for many celular functions,including protein processing and calcium homeostasis $8 – 1 0$ . Interestingly, multiple lines of evidence show that virus infection always induces ER stressin mammaliancellsl-14,and in trn,theER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) influences the expression of certain inflammatory cytokines14,15. Moreover, the ER is the main intracellular reservoir for calcium,and many ER physiological functions are calcium dependent16-18. However,it remains unclear whether ER stressis involved in the robust induction of IFN-I.

In this study, we found that ISG expression positively regulates IFN- $\cdot \beta$ via ER stress.Furthermore,we employed atandem affinity purification method and discovered a protein interacting with MAVS,mitochondrial calcium uniporter protein (MCU),thus linking ER stress with the MAVS-mediated immune response.In addition, by screening a library of 117 human ISG genes,we identified TNFRl as a positive regulator of IFN-I expression.

# Results and Discussion

ISG expression positively regulates IFN ${ \bf \beta } \cdot { \bf \{ \beta \} }$ via ER stress.Due to the critical role of IFN-I in the antiviral response and immune homeostasis19-22,it is worth clarifying the signaling factors ivolved in the rapid and robust inductionofIFN-Iin cells upon virus and bacterialinfections.Previous studies have shown the existence of positive feedback pathways from ISG expression to the upstream cytokine IFN- $\cdot \beta ^ { 2 3 - 2 6 }$ .However, whether positivefeedback pathwaysare also involved inRLR signaling has yettobe clarified.In the present study, we found that MAVS co-localized with Tom20 (a mitochondrial marker),suggesting that MAVS is expressed on mitochondriain HeLacells (Fig.1A),consistent with a previous report4.We also observed thatthe deletion of MAVS abolished poly(I:C)-induced IFN- $\cdot \beta$ expression (Fig.1B) and downstream ISG levels,including those of $^ { 2 ^ { \prime } , 5 ^ { \prime } }$ -oligoadenylate synthetase1(OAS1) and protein kinase R (PKR) (Fig.1C,D).Interestingly,we found that knockout of IFNAR1 significantly decreased IFN- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \beta$ levels, suggesting that ISG expression positively regulates the upstream cytokine IFN- $\cdot \ \beta$ .We also observed that deletion of IFNAR1 dramatically reduced the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 upon poly(I:C) treatment. Thus,together with previous studies, we suggest thatthere is a feedback pathway from ISG expression to IFN $\cdot \beta$ in RLR signaling.

Accumulating evidence has shown that the virus infection-induced interferon response is always accompaniedby ER stressincels11,2,14.Tus, we addressed whether ISG expressionregulates IFN $\cdot \beta$ through ER stress by constructinga GFP-tagged XBP-1 plasmid and transfecting it into HeLacels.Asshown inFig.1F,under normal conditions,XBP-1 is expressed without the GFPtag.However,when ER stressoccurs,endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling1(IRE1)removes a 26bp intron fromthe Xbpl transcript,leading to atranslation frame-shift and fused expression of GFP.By using this system,we found that there were few GFP-positive cells under normal conditions. However,poly(I:C)or thapsigargin (TG,a specific ER stressinducer) treatment significantly increased the number ofGFP-positive cells (Fig.1G,H).Furthermore,we found that transcriptional XBP-1 splicing (XBP-1s)levels were also significantly increased in poly(I:C)-or TG-treated cels (Fig.1I),suggesting that poly(I:C) treatment induces ER stress.

Next,we examined how poly(I:C) treatment induces ER stress.To address this,we frst assessed whether MAVS or IFNAR1 is involved in this processAs shown in Fig.1J,poly(I:C) treatment increased XBP-1s levels only in WT MEF cells but not in MAVS-knockout or IFNAR1-knockout cells,suggesting that poly(I:C) treatment-induced ER stressis indeed MAVSorIFNAR1dependent. Given thatthe deletion of either MAVSor IFNAR1abolished ISG expresson(Fig.1C,D),these results indicate that poly(I:C)-induced ISG expression might beinvolved in the inductionofER stress.To further examine the roleofER stressin theactivationofRLR signaling,MEFcels were treated with TG prior to poly(I:C)treatment.As shown inFig.1K,TG treatment significantly increased IFN- $\cdot \beta$ levels in WT MEF cells,suggesting that ER stress positively regulates RLR signaling activation. However,this efect was largely inhibited in IFNAR1-knockout MEFcells,indicating that IFNAR1 signaling also regulates IFN- $\cdot \beta$ expression through ER stress in an independent manner.Taken together,we found that ER stress is required for ISG expression-induced IFN- $\cdot \beta$ production.

MCU interacts with MAVS.ER stressalways induces mitochondrial dysfunction,such as calcium overload and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species $( \mathrm { R O S } ) ^ { 2 7 - 2 9 }$ . As MAVS complexes are mainly localized on mitochondria and mitochondrial dynamics affect RLR signaling activation30,31, we hypothesized that some proteins on mitochondria mightlink ER stresstoRLR signaling activation.To identify such molecules that might interact with MAVS and participate in the MAVS-mediated immune response, we employed the tandem affinity purification method to identify MAVS-interacting proteins. We constructed an expresion vector (containing both Flag and HA tags) encoding full-length MAVS and established a stably expressing suspension HeLa cell line. As shown in Fig. 2A, $^ { 8 \mathrm { ~ L ~ } }$ of suspended cells were lysed,and the lysates were sequentially immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag-and anti-HA-coated beads.Finaly,the eluted proteins were separately fractionated by SDS-PAGE(Fig.2B)follwed byhigh-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.Many protein peptides were found onlyin the MAVS overexpression group,including mitochondrial Tutranslation elongation factor (TUFM),voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein1(VDAC1),voltage-dependent anionselective channel protein 2(VDAC2)and MCU (Fig.2C).Among these,TUFM,VDAC1 and VDAC2 have already been reported to interact with MAVs32.3. In contrast,MCU,a mitochondrial calcium uniporter protein, was only recentlydiscovered3435.We further confirmed the interaction of MAVS and MCU in cells stably expressing MAVS (Fig.2D),and immunofluorescence experiments showed that MCU co-localizes with MAVS in HeLa cels (Fig.2E,F).Next, we found that the interaction between MAVS and MCU appeared to be specific,given that MAVS did not interact with mitochondrial calcium uptake 1(MICU1),a protein regulating MCU(Fig.2G). Furthermore, we observed that endogenous MCU interacted with endogenous MAVs (Fig. 2H). Together, these results indicate a physical interaction between MCU and MAVS and suggest that MCU might regulate the MAVS-mediated immune response.

MCU mediates ER stress-induced RLR signaling activation. Because we identified MCU as a MAVS-interacting protein,we evaluated whether MCU is involved in MAVS-mediated immune activation.In controlcels,poly(I:C)treatment induced a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated IRF3,but this effct was largely inhibited inMCU-knockdown cels (Fig.3A).A similar effectof MCUwas observed with regard to IFN- $\cdot \beta$ levels (Fig.3Band Sup Fig.1A,B).To further confirm this finding,we transfected Flag-tagged MCU into HeLa cells and examined the effect on the immune response.As shown in Fig.3C,D,ectopic expression of MCU resulted in large increases in the levels of $\mathsf { p }$ -IRF3and IFN- $\cdot \beta$ .Consistently, similar observations were found for SeV infection-induced IFN- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \beta$ levels and XBP-1s levels (Sup Fig.2A-D).Furthermore,we found that the effect of MCU for IFN- $\cdot \beta$ levels was MAVS-dependent,as knockout of MAVS disrupted this increase (Fig.3E).Therefore, these results suggest that MCU positively regulates IFN $\cdot \beta$ levels in a MAVS-dependent manner.

Next, we asked how MCU regulates the MAVS-mediated immune response.As shown in Supplemental Fig.3A,we found that MCU knockdown did not alter cellcycle parameters.However, knockdown of MCU did impair mitochondrial calcium uptake ability36and decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by poly(I:C)treatment (Fig.3F),which is reported to be essential forRLR signaling activation7.As MCU is a mitochondrial calcium uniporter protein,we then tested whether its calcium uniporter capacity was necessary for this process.We treated cells with $\mathtt { R u } 3 6 0$ ,a specific mitochondrial calcium uptake inhibitor, to block calcium uniporter activity. Our results showed that $\mathtt { R u } 3 6 0$ treatment significantly decreased poly(I:C)-induced IFN- $\cdot \boldsymbol { \beta }$ （204号 levels (Fig.3G),suggesting that the regulation of MCU for the MAVS-mediated immune response is dependent on its capacityas acalcium uniporter. In addition,N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC,an inhibitor ofROS production) also reduced poly(I:C)-induced IFN- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \beta$ levels (Fig.3G).Lastly,we tested whether MCU is involved in the ER stress-induced upregulation ofRLR signaling activation.As shown in Fig.3H,I,MCU knockdown abolished TG treatment-induced IFN $\cdot \beta$ expression,suggesting that MCU contributes to the ER stress-induced amplification of RLR signalingactivation.Together,these results indicate that ISG expresson-ER stress-MCU constitute a positive feedback pathway that contributes to amplified IFN- $\cdot \beta$ expression.

TNFR1 is one ISG that positively regulates RLR signaling independent of ER stress.To further define specific ISGs in the regulation of amplified IFN $\cdot \beta$ expression, we performed an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of 117 human ISGs for impacts on IFN- $\cdot \beta$ levels.As shown in Fig. 4A,we transfected each ISG gene into HEK293Tcells together with a luciferase reporter containing the proximal promoter sequence of IFN-β.Our results showed that five ISGs (MC3R,GSDMD,LHFPL1,TNFRl,and MX2) significantly increased IFN- $\cdot \beta$ levels( $> 2$ -fold) (Fig.4B). Subsequent functional studies revealed that the ectopic expression of TNFR1 significantly increases the levels of p-IRF3 and IFN- $\cdot \beta$ (Fig.4C,D).To confirm this,we isolated TNFR1-knockout MEFcells and observed that the knockout of this gene significantly decreased the poly(I:C)-induced levels of IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \beta$ mRNA (Fig. $^ \mathrm { 4 E , F }$ ).Together,our results indicate that TNFRl,as an ISG,positively regulates RLR signaling activation.We then assessed whether TNFRl could activate RLR signaling through the inductionofER stress. Unfortunately, the ectopic expression of TNFR1 failed to induce ER stressincells (Fig.4G),indicating that TNFR1 positively regulates RLR signaling independent ofER stress.Interestingly, we found that the effectof TNFR1forRLR signaling was also MAVS-dependent.As shown in Fig.4H,knockoutof MAVS significantly blocked overexpression of TNFRl-induced the increase of IFN- $\cdot \beta$ levels.We also observed thatRIG-Iand MDA5,the keycomponents ofRLR signaling activation,were dramatically decreased in IFNAR1 knockout MEF cels in a transcriptional-dependent manner (Sup Fig. 4A-C). Our findings support that ISG expression-induced ER stress might be mediated by the converged expression of multiple proteins, warranting further investigation.

In summary,we found that ISGs were required for IFN $\cdot \beta$ expression in response to infection,and the effect is further enhanced byER stres.Furthermore,we identifed MCU,the MAVS interacting protein,mediated the ER stress-inducedRLR signaling activation.Inaddition,TNFR1,an ISG gene,also positivelyregulates the induction ofIFN-β.Taken together,our findings demonstrate that MCUand TNFR1 were involved inthe regulation of RLR signaling (Fig.4I).The present work implicates potential targets in the treatmentof IFN-I dysfunction-induced diseases.
