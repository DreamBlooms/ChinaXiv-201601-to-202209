Abstract Here we briefly review the history of research on the Laiyang dinosaur and dinosaur egg faunas, summarize the contributions of C.C.Young and other elder paleontologists to the discoveries of the Late Cretaceous dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs from Laiyang,and introduce the new discoveries and the advances in the research on the Laiyang faunas. The new investigations in Laiyang from 2Oo8 have found a series of valley developed in plain and more than ten new dinosaur or dinosaur egg fossil beds.In 2O10,we began the massve excavations at two localities in Jingangkou and collected abundant dinosaurs and other vertebrate fossils,such as a new saurolophine, some theropod material and a new taxon of turtle egg.The bone beds in Locality 2 with the typical sedimentary and burial patterns of mudflow,and these fossil deposits are interpreted as having been carried and deposited by mudflow.The re-observation and the CT scanning data of the crest of Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus (IVPP V 725) show that the crest is fractured and solid.However,based on the re-observations of its cranial and postcranial specimens,we consider that Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus is a valid taxon of lambeosaurines,which have the hollow crest.Therefore,the crest of Tsintaosaurus might not belong to the skull of this individual,and the true form of the crest needs to be confirmed in the future work.We reassess the three species of Tanius,and obtain several results.1) Tanius sinensis and Tanius chingkankouensis are the valid species of Tanius; 2) Tanius laiyangensis is invalid.; 3) the sacrum and ilium of Tanius chingkankouensis with typical hadrosaurid features should not be referred to Tanius.

# 1 Introduction

Laiyang is located in the center of the Jiaodong Peninsula,and the well-developed terrestrial strata around Laiyang belong to the Lower Cretaceous Laiyang and Qingshan groups and the Upper Cretaceous Wangshi Group. The age of these strata ranges from $1 3 0 ~ \mathrm { M a }$ to 70 Ma (Wang et al., 2010, 2012). The Laiyang Group consists primarily of grey and grey-green shales that were deposited in lacustrine environments.Abundant fossils have been recovered from the Laiyang Group,including plants, insects,conchostracans,various other invertebrates, and dinosaur tracks (Chow,1923; Grabau,1923; Hong and Wang,1990; Zhang,1992; Young, 1960; Li and Zhang,2000, 2001). The Qingshan Group consists mainly of volcanic rocks interbedded with sedimentary rocks (Liu et al., 2011),and contains the ceratopsian dinosaur Psittacosaurus (Young, 1958; Zhao,1962), pterosaurs (Young, 1958; Zhou,2010),and the turtle Peishanemys (Chow, 1954a). The fossil assemblage in the Laiyang and Qingshan groups is similar to the Jehol Biota,and forms the Laiyang Jehol Biota (Wang et al. 2O10). The Upper Cretaceous Wangshi Group mainly comprises fluvial and lacustrine red and gray-green siltstones and mudstones interbedded with gray and gray-green glutenites and siltstones, and is divided from botom to top into the Xingezhuang, Jiangjunding, Jingangkou and Changwangpu formations (Hu et al., 2Ool),the last of which was thought to occur only in Zhucheng and to be absent in Laiyang (Wang et al. 2O12). The Jiangjunding and Jingangkou formations contain rich concentrations of hadrosauroid bones,coexisting with abundant other vertebrate bones and dinosaur eggs.More recently, Yan and Chen (2oo5) obtained an isotope age of $7 3 ~ \mathrm { { M a } }$ for the Jingangkou Formation (which they called the Hongtuya Formation) based on a basalt sample from the town of Daxizhuang in Jiaozhou City. The dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs in the Wangshi Group form the Laiyang Hadrosauroid Fauna and Dinosaur Egg Fauna. Laiyang is also among the relatively few areas worldwide that are rich in both dinosaur bones and dinosaur eggs.

The earliest discoveries on dinosaur bones and dinosaur eggs in Laiyang can be traced back to the 192Os,and a golden age of exploration of the fauna took place in the 195Os.It was from Laiyang that Chinese geologists and paleontologists first reported a fossil assemblage containing Chinese dinosaurs, dinosaur eggs, pterosaurs, insects and plants (Wang et al., 201o). Because of these discoveries,the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology of China was founded in 1984 in Laiyang. In 1951,an IVPP expedition team led by C. C. Young undertook a series of massive prospecting trips and excavations in Laiyang (Liu,1951; Young,1958) and found abundant vertebrate fossils including multiple specimens of the lambeosaurine hadrosaurid Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus,the first reasonably complete dinosaurian skeleton after the establishment of P. R. China (Young,1958). These discoveries turned Laiyang into a focal point for the study of dinosaur and dinosaur egg fossils in China.Although dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs continued to be found sporadically in Laiyang in the following decades,no large-scale excavations were conducted. Since 2Oo8,however,an IVPP-Laiyang team has carried out annual field activities including massive excavations,at both Young's old quarry (Locality 1) and a new quarry (Locality 2) in Laiyang. During these new field surveys, we have discovered several dinosaur and dinosaur egg localities,and found abundant fossils.Here we briefly review the history of research on the dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs of Laiyang, including the contributions of Young and other paleontologists, and also introduce the new finds and research advances in Laiyang.

2 History of discoveries of dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs in Laiyang

Laiyang is an important source of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs in China. In the last century, C. C. Young,A. Grabau, H.C. Tan, D. S. Liu, M. C. Chow and other geologists and paleontologists conducted a series of field investigations and excavations, and abundant fossils were found, especially of dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs.The history of research on dinosaurs from Laiyang can be generally divided into three periods.

# 2.1The first period of dinosaur discovery in Laiyang (192Os-1930s)

Tan (1923) reported the presence of dinosaurs,fishes, insects and plants in the Cretaceous strata of Laiyang. Grabau (1923） studied the fishes and insects,while T.H. Chow (1923) studied the plants.The dinosaur material, which had been collected by Tan, is now kept in the palaeontological collections of the Museum of Evolution, Uppsala University,Sweden (PMU). Wiman (1929) described the hadrosauroid material and named it Tanius sinensis in Tan's honor. Buffetaut (1995) and Buffetaut and Tong (1995) referred the ankylosaurid material to Pinacosaurus cf. grangeri. Poropat and Kear (2Ol3) reassessed some theropod material. In addition,H. S.Wang (1930) subsequently reported some dinosaurs from Jingangkou.

# 2.2The second period of dinosaur discovery in Laiyang (1950s-1970s)

In 1950,L.H. Wang and K. Y. Kwan from the Department of Geology and Mineralogy, University of Shandong collected some dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs from the Upper Cretaceous strata around Laiyang (Chow,1951). These specimens are now kept in the Museum of Geology at Jilin University and were reported on by Chow (1951),who identified them as hadrosaurid with Young's help.

Young attched great importance to these discoveries.In 1951, he led a field expedition to Laiyang in which D. S.Liu and C. Y. Wang also participated. This team carried out massive excavations at Jingangkou (Wangshi Group) and Doushan (Qingshan Group), digging out abundant dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs (Liu,1951; Young,1958).Liu (1951) reported in detail on the field investigations and excavations. Young (1954) studied the dinosaur eggs and divided them into two categories: short eggs (Oolithes spheroides) and long eggs (Oolithes elongates),proposed the preliminary classification of dinosaur eggs based on this scheme. Chow (l954b) described the microstructure of dinosaur eggshell. These early studies helped to lay the methodological and nomenclatural foundation for subsequent research on dinosaur eggs.In addition, Chow(1954a) studied the turtle fossils collected in 1951.

Young established the species Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus based on a complete composite skeleton and additional bones from the Wangshi Group in a monograph entitled“The Dinosaurian Remains of Laiyang, Shantung”,which was an important monograph about dinosaurs produced in the early stages of P.R. China. (Young,1958) (Fig.1). The book also reported other dinosaurs collected from the Wangshi Group, including a new species of Tanius (Tanius chingkankouensis), theropods (cf. Szechuanosaurus campi and Chinkankousaurus fragilis),and some fractured bones referred to stegosaurs and sauropods (Young,1958). These dinosaur finds revealed the basic contours of the Laiyang Hadrosauroid Fauna (Young,1958). Young also reported Psittacosaurus sinensis and some pterosaur bones from the Qingshan Group (Young,1958),and it was the first report of pterosaurs from China.

Dinosaurs reported from Laiyang after this publication included another species of Tanius,T. laiyangensis (Zhen, 1976) and a pachycephalosaurid,Micropachycephalosaurus hongtuyanensis (Dong, 1978). In addition, there was another hadrosaurid, Shantungosaurus giganteus found from Zhucheng and Laiyang (Hu, 1973; Hu et al., 2001).

In the 197Os, Z. K. Zhao further studied the microstructure of dinosaur eggs, erecting the two oofamilies Elongatoolithidae and Spheroolithidae based on Young and Chow's work (Zhao and Jiang,1974; Zhao,1975,1979),he was also the first to propose the current international classification of dinosaur eggs (Zhao and Jiang,1974; Zhao,1979).

# 2.3The third period of dinosaur discovery in Laiyang (from 2008)

Since 2Oo8,the IVPP-Laiyang expedition team has carried out a series of field investigations in Laiyang. These investigations have revealed sets of valleys that interrupt the plains that dominate the landscape and more than ten dinosaur bone and egg sites have been found in the valleys.In 2O10, the team undertook massive excavations at Locality 1(Young's old Tsintaosaurus quarry) and Locality 2 (a new quarry),and collected abundant dinosaur bones.Abundant science bases and geoparks have been founded in the field area, such as the Laiyang National Geopark,a National Key Protected Fosil Locality,a Field Observation Base of the Ministry of Land and Resources, etc.

# 3 Laiyang Hadrosauroid Fauna and Dinosaur Egg Fauna

Since the 192Os,abundant dinosaur bones and other fossils have been found in Cretaceous strata around Laiyang form three important Cretaceous faunas: the Laiyang Jehol Fauna, the Laiyang Hadrosauroid Fauna, and the Laiyang Dinosaur Egg Fauna.

# 3.1Laiyang Hadrosauroid Fauna

The Laiyang Hadrosauroid Fauna represented by Tsintaosaurus and Tanius is one of the most important and famous Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas in China. Up to now, members of seven major reptile clades have been reported (Wiman,1929; Young,1958; Hu,1973; Zhen,1976; Dong,1978; Buffetaut and Tong,1995; Poropat and Kear,2013). Of the seven clades, nine species in eight genera have been named (Wang et al., 2O1O) (Table 1),and other unnamed members represent stegosaurs,sauropods and theropods (Young,1958; Poropat and Kear, 2013).

Hadrosauroids consist of some basal forms, known as non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroids, and the monophyletic Hadrosauridae (Prieto-Marquez,2O1O). Many hadrosaurid species have hypertrophied nasal passages associated with cranial crests, which vary widely in morphology and are important in hadrosaurid taxonomy (Ostrom, 1962, Hopson, 1975). Hadrosauridae is divided into two main clades: the flat-headed or solid-crested Saurolophinae,and the hollowcrested Lambeosaurinae (Horner et al. 2Oo4). In recent phylogenetic analyses, Tanius has been recovered as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, whereas Tsintaosaurus and Shantungosaurus have been placed in Hadrosauridae as a lambeosaurine and a saurolophine respectively (PrietoMarquez, 201o; Zhang and Wang,2012).

# 3.2 Laiyang Dinosaur Egg Fauna

Abundant dinosaur eggs were collected at the same time with the dinosaur body fossils. To date,four oofamilies, five oogenera,and eleven oospecies have been reported, forming the Laiyang Dinosaur Egg Fauna (Wang et al., 201O) (Table 2).

# 4 New fossil discoveries in Laiyang

During the recent fieldwork in the Wangshi Group, several valleys were discovered in Jingangkou and Jiangjunding,and are considered to form “the Laiyang Dinosaur Valley Series”,where more than ten dinosaur bone and egg sites have been found (Fig. 2). The dinosaur valleys generally trend nearly SN or EW, and some intersect.

# 4.1Re-excavation of Young's old Tsintaosaurus quarry (Locality 1) and the discovery of a new turtle egg

In 2010, the IVPP-Laiyang expedition team confirmed the location of the quarry where Young found Tsintaosaurus in 1951 (Locality 1),and also reopened the quarry for further excavation. The bone-bearing beds were identified,and several isolated bones of hadrosauroids and other vertebrates were found in this site.Among these fossils,a single elongated egg is the most noteworthy. The microstructure of the egg shellis diferent from which seen in the egg shell of dinosaurs, birds or crocodiles. This specimen was identified as a new type of turtle egg and named Emydoolithus laiyangensis (Wang et al.,2013a).

# 4.2 Excavations and new discoveries inLocality 2

Locality 2 is in the east part of Jingangkou Village, $1 \mathrm { k m }$ east ofLocality1,and represents an exposure of the middle part of the Wangshi Group (Wang et al., 2012). Eight layers bearing dinosaur bones occur in a thickness of $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m } }$ ，five of them have been excavated in recently years.An on-site museum has been built in the western part of the excavation area.

The first and second fossil-bearing layers are composed of gray-green silty mudstone containing black bones. They are actually parts of a single original layer, but movement along a fault separated them.The fossils in the first layer are mainly big theropod and hadrosauroid bones,and are similar to those found at the bottom of the second layer.In the middle of the second layer, big complete bones and small rounded bone fragments are mixed together, whereas the fossils in the upper part of the layer are all fractured and rounded small bones.The third,fourth and fifth layers mainly consist of siltstones,and the fossils in these layers are white in color.The excavations carried out in recent years have targeted the third layer, which is 1.5-1.8 m thick,and contains abundant hadrosauroid bones in a normally graded vertical sequence. Near the top of this layer are small vertebrae and fractured bones,and near the bottom are big isolated bones, some of which are articulated.Abundant hadrosauroid and other vertebrate bones are found in the fourth layer,and several complete large turtle fossils in the fifth layer.

The strata at Locality 2 are interpreted to have been mainly formed by mudflow events, because they show the typical sedimentary and taphonomic characteristics expected for mudflow deposits: mudstones and siltstones with some poorly-sorted gravel, most of the bones are isolate, the large and small complete bones are mixed in the bottom of the layers,the long axes of the bones lack a consistent orientation, and a few bones are oblique or vertical in orientation. The taphonomy of the bones shows that a group of live hadrosauroids was engulfed and torn apart by a sudden flood and mudflow,and the carcasses were carried a short distance,and rapidly buried. However, abundant fractured and rounded small bones and plant fragments indicate these fossils were reworked before the final bury. Thousands of hadrosauriod bones exposed in recent years represent at least 2O-3O individuals.These can be divided into three size classes,which are tentatively assumed to adult, subadult,and late juvenile individuals,according to the studies of ontogenetic changes in the hadrosaurid Maiasaura peeblesorum by Horner et al. (2000). Some of the hadrosauroid bones are referred to Saurolophinae on the basis of the maxilla with a anterodorsal process, the jugal with a long anteroposteriorly rostral process and a shallow embayment,and the distal end of the ischial shaft without the“foot-like” process (PrietoMarquez, 2008,201o). These saurolophine material are belong to a new genus and species, Laiyangosaurus youngi in Young's honor, based on the following autapomorphies: a prominent and narrow ridge on the lateral side of the nasal, a slightly posteriorly deflected primary ridge of the maxilary tooth,a dorsolateroposteriorlly recurved retroarticular process of the surangular, a relatively shallow and rostrodorsally directed caudal margin of the lacrimal process of the jugal, the posterior margin of the maxilla facet limited by a rostrodorsally-oriented narrow ridge,and orbital margins that are wider than the infratemporal margins of the jugal (Zhang et al. 2017). In addition,other hadrosauroid bones would be referred to Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus (Lambeosaurinae) on the basis of the humerus with a long and wide deltopectoral crest, and the ilium with a deep central plate (Young,1958; Prieto-Marquez,2008,2010; Zhang,2013).

5 Recent advances in the study of dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs from Laiyang

# 5.1Validity of Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus and CT scanning of its crest

Young (1958) described Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus based on a nearly complete composite skeleton (IVPP V 725),a separate incomplete skull (IVPP V 818),and additional postcranial materials from the Wangshi Group west of Jingangkou Village,Laiyang. T. spinorhinus has a rodlike,anterodorsally projected cranial crest, which consists of the nasal bones and terminates in two branches (Fig.3). This feature differs from the posterodorsally projected crests of other lambeosaurines, which incorporate both the nasals and the premaxillae (Ostrom, 1960; Hopson,1975; Horner, 2004; Evans et al., 2009). Since T. spinorhinus was reported in 1958,it has been the subject of considerable controversy, especially with regard to its crest. Some scholars have even doubted the validity of the taxon (Rozhdestvensky,1977; Taquet, 1991; Horner and Weisharnpel,1990). while some researchers believed that T. spinorhinus was assignable to Lambeosaurinae and most likely hollow crested, based on the presence of lambeosaurine features in the skull and postcranial bones (Maryanska and Osmolska,1981; Bret-Surman,1989;Buffetaut and Tong,1993,1995).Horner et al. (2004) confirmed that $T .$ （20 spinorhinus was a basal lambeosaurine through phylogenetic analysis. Prieto-Marquez and Wagner (2O13） restored T. spinorhinus with a hollow posterodorsally projected crest as in typical lambeosaurines, based on the skull and some additional bone fragments.

Recently, we used the CT scanner to scan the crest of Tsintaosaurus (IVPP V 725),and to reconstruct its internal structure (Zhang and Wang, 2Ol2). Notably, the fracture on the root of the crest is severe.There are only several small bone fragments between the crest and the skull. The fracture surfaces on the root of the crest do not match those of the skull (Fig. 3D,E) (Zhang and Wang,2012).Therefore, it is doubtful that the morphology of the crest of Tsintaosaurus is real.

The cross-section of the crest shows that there are three parts along the sagittl plane (Fig. 3C). The middle part is a rectangular,long strip in our 3D-reconstruction. The two lateral parts do not enclose a cavity around the middle part, but instead sandwich the middle part between them. Therefore,the crest of Tsintaosaurus could not enclose a nasal cavity, which is divided into a pair of hollow passage in the crest of all the other lambeosaurines. In addition,the middle part of the crest of Tsintaosaurus is also part of the skeleton,and the crest would be solid, not hollow.

However, based on our observations of the skull and postcranial bones of Tsintaosaurus, we consider the descriptions of the other parts of Tsintaosaurus by Young and other researchers to be reliable and accurate (Young,1958; Buffetaut and Tong,1993,1995). Tsintaosaurus exhibits a series of characteristics of Lambeosaurinae, including the frontal being completely excluded from the orbital margin, the upward doming on the dorsal part of the frontal, the width being greater than the length of the supratemporal fenestra, the parietal sagittal crest being relatively short and down-curved, the anterodorsal process absent in the anterior of the maxilla, the dorsal process of the maxilla being posterodorsally extended, the symphyseal process of the dentary being medioventrally extended, the quadrate being relatively curved, and the distal region of the ischial shaft being ventrally expanded, forming a large “boot-like” process (Horner et al., 2004; Prieto-Marquez, 2008,2010).

In conclusion, Tsintaosaurus is a valid lambeosaurine taxon, but the crest we examined does not appear to be the real one of Tsintaosaurus,or even the material might possibly not belong to the skull of this individual. However, the anterior part of its frontal and prefrontal

both extend dorsally to support the crest. Given that morphology, Tsintaosaurus should havea hollow up-extended crest,as the other lambeosaurines.However,future work will have to confirm the true form of the crest.

# 5.2 Validity of three species of Tanius

Three species have been placed in the genus Tanius (T. sinensis,T. chingkankouensis,andT.laiyangensis). Only the type species, T. sinensis,has a partial skull (Wiman,1929),and the other two species are known only from postcranial skeletons (Young, 1958,Zhen,1976).Therefore,the validity of T. chingkankouensis and T. laiyangensis was doubted by Buffetaut and Tong (1993,1995). Horner et al. (2004) suggested thatT.chingkankouensis is a valid taxon,and that T. laiyangensis is a synonym ofT.chingkankouensis.

Tanius sinensis was collected in 1923 from the Jiangjunding Formation, Wangshi Group stratigraphically below the Jingangkou Formation, where Tsintaosaurus were found (Tan, 1923; Wiman,1929). T. sinensis was described as a flat hadrosaurid based on a nearly complete skull(Fig. 4) and some postcranial bones (Wiman,1929).Recently,it was referred to a valid taxon of basal hadrosauroid with a series of basal hadrosauroid features, such as the presence of the rostral process of the jugal relatively shallow dorsoventrally, the posterodorsal border of the rostral process bearing a remarkable horizontally oriented ridge and continuing to the dorsal border of the rostral process (making a deep concave maxilla facet in the medial surface of the rostral process),and the apex of the supraacetabular process located caudodorsal to the caudal tuberosity of the ischial peduncle (Horner et al.,2004; Prieto-Marquez,2008,2010).

Young(1958) erected T. chingkankouensis based on a few postcranial bones collected in the same excavation with Tsintaosaurus spinorhins at Jingangkou,Laiyang. Buffetaut and Tong (1993,1995) considered that the ilium of T. chingkankouensis shows advanced hadrosaurid features.The ilium of T. chingkankouensis displays a characteristic of saurolophines (PrietoMarquez, 2008,2010),in that the apex of the supraacetabular process is located anterodorsal to the caudal tuberosity of the ischial peduncle (Fig. 5). In addition, whether the sacra with a longitudinal ventral furrow belong to T. chingkankouensis is questionable,because the recent research suggests that the presence or absence of that ventral sacral furrow varies within species (Prieto-Marquez, 2O08). Therefore, this character would not be diagnostic of T.chingkankouensis.However, T. chingkankouensis has a slightly inflated distal end of the ischium (Young,1958),and that morphology is a characteristic of basal hadrosauroids (PrietoMarquez, 20o8,2010). In addition, T. chingkankouensis has the parallel dorsal and ventral margins of the distal blade of the scapula, which is similar with T. sinensis, but the more straight dorsal margins of the scapula is different from T. sinensis (Young,1958).Therefore, T. chingkankouensis is a valid taxon of Tanius,but the ilium would not belong to Tanius,and there are some questions about its sacrum that will require further study.

Fig.4Braincase and jugal of Tanius sinensis (PMU 24720) A.braincase in dorsal view; B-C.left jugal in lateral (B) and dorsal(C) views

T. laiyangensis was assigned to Tanius based on a broken ischium and a sacrum with a ventral furrow,similar to $T .$ chingkankouensis,collected from the same site as Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus and $T .$ chingkankouensis (Zhen,1976). Zhen (1976) considered that the number of the vertebrae of sacrum in T. laiyangensi is more than T. chingkankouensis.However, the presence or absence of furrow and the number of the sacral are not diagnostic (Prieto-Marquez, 2008,2010). Therefore, T. laiyangensis is likely not a valid taxon.

# 5.3Advances in Shantungosaurus giganteus

Shantungosaurus giganteus was described as a giant flat-head saurolophine, based on a nearly complete composite skeleton collected from Wangshi Group,in Longgujian, Zhucheng, Shandong (Hu,1973; Hu et al.,2001). There are also a few specimens of S. giganteus found in Laiyang (Hu et al., 2Oo1). Another two large hadrosaurids, Zhuchengosaurus maximus (Zhao et al.,2007) and Huaxiaosaurus aigahtens (Zhao et al.,2011),were reported from Zhucheng, which were considered synonyms of S. giganteus (Ji et al., 2O11; Hone et al., 2014).

# 5.4Advances in dinosaur eggs from Laiyang

Liu et al. (2O13) compared dinosaur eggs collected in Laiyang, Shandong Province and Changtu,Liaoning Province,and referred the eggs in Changtu to Spheroolithus spheroides (Young,1954; Zhao,1979) and S. megadermus (Young and Wang,1959; Zhao,1979), which were known only from Laiyang in prior reports.The dictyoolithid eggs are widely distributed in China, and they are the important members of the Laiyang Dinosaur Egg Fauna. Wang et al. (2013b) re-examined the holotypes of the four oospecies of Dictyoolithidae,and determined that only Dictyoolithus hongpoensis was valid in the oogenus Dictyoolithus.They established a new oogenus Protodictyoolithus, and placed $D$ . jiangi (Liu and Zhao, 2004) from the Laiyang Basin in Protodictyoolithus (Wang et al.,2013b).

These new discoveries and advances in recent years have enriched the diversity of the Laiyang Hadrosauroid Fauna and Dinosaur Egg Fauna.With further excavation and fossil preparation, more discoveries will be made in the future.

摘要：简要回顾了莱阳恐龙和恐龙蛋化石群的研究历史和以杨钟健为代表的老一代地质古生物学者对莱阳恐龙和恐龙蛋研究发现的杰出贡献，并介绍了莱阳恐龙和恐龙蛋的最新发现和若干研究进展。在近年来对莱阳周边地层进行的大规模考察中，发现了一系列发育在平原上的恐龙峡谷群，以及其中蕴含的十几个恐龙和恐龙蛋新地点和新层位。2010年开始，在对莱阳金岗口村附近的2个化石地点的发掘中，发现了以鸭嘴龙科为主的大量脊椎动物化石和蛋化石，包括一类新的栉龙亚科成员，一些大型兽脚类恐龙化石，以及一新的龟鳖类蛋化石等。2号地点化石富集层具有典型的泥石流沉积特征和骨骼埋藏特征。对棘鼻青岛龙的特殊头饰进行了CT扫描和三维重建，发现其头饰是实心结构，但其他骨骼特征证明棘鼻青岛龙属于具有头饰的赖氏龙亚科是确定无疑的，所以目前发现的头饰应不是其真实状态或根本不属于其头部骨骼。此外，对谭氏龙1属3种的重新观察研究得出以下结论：中国谭氏龙和金刚口谭氏龙应是有效属种，但部分骨骼还有疑问，还需要进一步研究，而莱阳谭氏龙为无效属种。
