# SUMMARY

Main Problem:Epilepsy is one of the more common neurological disorders.The medication is often ineffective to the patients suffering from intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).As their seizures are usually self-terminated,the elucidation of the mechanism underlying endogenous seizure termination will help to find a new strategy for epilepsy treatment.We aim to examine the role of inhibitory interneurons in endogenous seizure termination in TLE patients.Methods:Whole-cell recordings were conducted on inhibitory interneurons in seizure-onset cortices of intractable TLE patients and the temporal lobe cortices of nonseizure individuals.The intrinsic property of the inhibitory interneurons and the strength of their GABAergic synaptic outputs were measured. The quantitative data were introduced into the computer-simulated neuronal networks to figure out a role of these inhibitory units in the seizure termination.Results:In addition to functional downregulation,a portion of inhibitory interneurons in seizure-onset cortices were upregulated in encoding the spikes and controlling their postsynaptic neurons.A patch-like upregulation of inhibitory neurons in the local network facilitated seizure termination.The upregulations of both inhibitory neurons and their output synapses synergistically shortened seizure duration,attenuated seizure strength,and terminated seizure propagation. Conclusion: Automatic seizure termination is likely due to the fact that a portion of the inhibitory neurons and synapses are upregulated in the seizure-onset cortices.This mechanism may create novel therapeutic strategies to treat intractable epilepsy,such as the simultaneous upregulation of cortical inhibitory neurons and their output synapses.

# Introduction

Cortical seizure is presumably caused by an imbalance of neural excitation and inhibition toward the synchronous overexcitation of network neurons [l-1l].After antiepileptic medications are given through strengthening GABAergic synapses and inhibiting neuronal overexcitation [l2],the epileptic patients,especially suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE),become drug resistant [13,14].These intractable TLE patients are usually treated by the surgical removal of the seizure tissues [l5].Neurosurgery brings side effects to cognitive processes and lacks long-term effectiveness.Therefore,the pathological features of cortical seizure-onset neuron networks in the intractable TLE patients need to be figured outin order to reveal endogenous mechanism underlying seizure termination and to develop new strategies arresting epilepsy.

In human epileptic tissue,the neurons produce various patterns of burst spikes in response to depolarization pulses [l6-22]. The excitatory and inhibitory synapses undergo plasticity [23-25]. GABA reversal potentials shift [26,27].These characteristics can be used to explain seizure onset,but not seizure termination. Whether these features are specific for the seizure-onset tissues need be compared with the control [l6]. How the different types of neurons are involved in the seizure onset and termination of human epilepsy remains unclear.

In this study,we aim to examine a role of inhibitory neurons in endogenous seizure termination at the seizure-onset cortices from intractable TLE patients.Our analyses included their intrinsic property to encode the spikes and their GABAergic synaptic outputs to control the excitatory neurons.These analyses may reveal the functional states of inhibitory neurons and synapses in seizure-onset cortex,but not ensure their roles in seizure termination.We introduced our experimental data into a computer-simulated neuronal network to determine how these pathological features mediate the seizure onset and termination.

# Materials and Methods Ethical Issues

The use of brain tissue from the patients and the procedure of surgically dissecting their brain tissues were approved by the Ethics Committee of Human Tissue Use in General Hospital of Chinese Military (2o1o824ool).The judgment for intractable neocortical TLE patients to receive a neurosurgical therapy was based on international criteria,for example,resistant to the medications [28,29].It is noteworthy that the patients for harvesting brain tissues were not mesial temporal sclerosis based on the clinical diagnosis.The neurons and GABAergic synapses from TLE patients were insensitive to sodium valproate (please see Figure S1).Neurosurgery for meningioma patients was based on diagnostic indications [3o].The anesthetic and neurosurgical procedures used in the TLE patients were based on the standards approved by the Food and Drug Agency, China.The approaches for cutting cortical slices and doing electrophysiological studies also were approved by the Ethics Committee of Human Tissue Use.

# Brain Tissues and Slices

The blocks of temporal lobe cortices $( 1 \times 1 \times 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } )$ ）were harvested from TLE patients (Table S1 in supporting data） for the experimental group.The patients suffering from glioma and meningioma in white matter who had no previous history of epilepsy attacks in clinical practices and of seizure discharges monitored by electroencephalogram (EEG) were used as controls.All of these neocortical TLE patients had been diagnosed as pharmacoresistant. The seizure-onset cortices were localized by EEG showing epileptic and interictal discharges.After the skull was opened, the seizure cortices were identified by embedding 32-channels'EEG in diagnosis-located areas (Figure l),in which the areas with frequent interictal discharges and the earliest seizure onsets were defined as the seizure-onset cortices.For the controls,their temporal lobe cortices were harvested, Samples were more than three centimeters away from meningioma in lateral ventricles and triangle regions or glioma in deep white matter localized by computerized topography.In surgical operations,surgeons were allowed to remove the parts of temporal lobe cortices legally to access glioma and meningiomaunderneath.

The tissues $( 1 \times 1 \times 1 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ in the size）isolated from the assigned cortices in vivo were immediately cut into two blocks (lXlXo.6 and 1XiXo.4) in modified and oxygenated( $9 5 \%$ （20 $\mathrm { ~ O } _ { 2 } /$ $5 \%$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ）artificial cerebrospinal fluid(ACSF,mM:124 NaCl,3 KCl,1 $. . 2 \ N a \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { P O } _ { 4 } .$ $2 6 ~ \mathrm { N a H C O _ { 3 } }$ $0 . 5 \mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ ， $5 ~ { \mathrm { M g } } { \mathrm { S } } { \mathrm { O } } _ { 4 }$ ，20 dextrose, and 5 HEPES; $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 3 5$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .The former blocks in this $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ACSF incubation were transferred to the research laboratory for electrophysiological studies,and the latter blocks were immediately placed into $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde in $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ phosphate buffer solution (PBS) about $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ for the studies of morphology and immunocytochemistry [31].

The slices( $3 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m } )$ ）from seizure-onset cortices in TLE patients and from nonepileptic ones in control individuals were cut by Vibratome in modified and oxygenated ACSF (mM:124 NaCl,3 KCl, $1 . 2 \ \mathrm { N a H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { P O } _ { 4 }$ 、 $2 6 \mathrm { \ N a H C O _ { 3 } }$ 、 $0 . 5 \mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 } ,$ $5 \mathrm { \ M g { S O _ { 4 } } } ,$ （204号 20 dextrose,and 5 HEPES; $\mathrm { p H } ~ 7 . 3 5$ ）at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and were held in the normal oxygenated ACSF (mM: 126 NaCl,2.5 KCl,1.2 $\mathrm { N a H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { P O } _ { 4 } .$ ， $2 6 \ \mathrm { N a H C O _ { 3 } }$ 、 $2 . 0 \ \mathrm { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ ， $2 . 0 \ M g \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ,$ ，10 dextrose,and 5 HEPES; $\mathrm { p H } ~ 7 . 3 5$ ） $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for one hour before the experiments. These slices were then transferred to a submersion chamber that was perfused with normal ACSF for electrophysiological experiments [32-34].

# Electrophysiological Studies in Cortical Interneurons

The selection of cortical interneurons for whole-cell recording was based on the following criteria.These neurons in layers II-IV of human cortices showed smaller round somata and multiple processes (Figure 2A),compared to relatively larger pyramidal neurons,under the DIC microscope (Nikon,FN-E6oo,Tokyo,Japan). These interneurons demonstrated fast spiking,no adaptation in the spike amplitudes and frequencies as well as high magnitude after-hyperpolarization (Figure S2),typical properties for inhibitory interneurons [35-38].

These interneurons were recorded by an amplifier (MultiClapm-7ooB;Axon Instrument Inc,Foster City,CA USA）under whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp.Electrical signals were inputted into pClamp-1O (Axon Instrument Inc.）with

$2 0 ~ \mathrm { k H z }$ sampling rate.The functions of inhibitory neurons were evaluated based on their intrinsic properties (such as input-output curve and spiking ability distribution）and output ability (inhibitory effect on their downstream pyramidal neurons).Pipette solution for recording neuronal action potentials included (mM) $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ -gluconate,5NaCl,0.4 EGTA,4 Mg-ATP,0.5TrisGTP,4 Na-phosphocreatine,and 5 HEPES $\mathrm { p H } ~ 7 . 4$ adjusted by 2M KOH).Pipette solution for recording inhibitory postsynaptic currents contained (mM)135 K-gluconate,20 KCl,4 NaCl,10 HEPES，0.5 EGTA，4 Mg-ATP，and 0.5 Tris-GTP $\mathrm { ( p H } \ 7 . 4 \$ adjusted by 2M KOH).The osmolarity of pipette solutions made freshly was 295-305 mOsmol,and the pipette resistance was 8- $1 0 ~  { \mathrm { M } } \Omega$ [39].

In the analyses of input-output and membrane I-V curves [40], depolarization pulses(l second） of various intensities were injected into these interneurons to induce repetitive spikes.Subthreshold and hyperpolarization pulses were injected to determine their passive membrane properties.In evaluating their ability of firing spikes,we measured the initiation of spikes by weak depolarization that was thought as neuronal sensitivity to excitatory inputs,that is,neuronal ability to convert synaptic signals into spikes [41,42].

The ability of interneurons to affect their target neurons was evaluated by recording GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC）under voltage-clamp [43]. $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3- $( 1 H , 4 H )$ -dioneand $4 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ D-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid were added into ACSF to block ionotropic glutamate receptor channels.At the end of experiments,bicuculline $( 1 0 ~ \mu \Lambda )$ was perfused onto the slices to examine whether synaptic responses were mediated by $\mathrm { G A B A _ { A } R }$ .sIPSC amplitudes represent the sensitivity and numberof $\mathrm { G A B A _ { A } R }$ .sIPSC frequency shows the probability of GABA release and the conversion of silent receptors into functional ones [43,44].

Calibration bars are $2 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s }$ and 20 mv/100 pA.

The data were analyzed if the recorded neurons had resting membrane potentials more negative than $- 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ and action potentials above $9 0 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ .The criteria for the acceptance in each experiment also included less than $5 \%$ changes in resting membrane potential，spike amplitudes,input and seal resistances throughout each experiment. The values of neuronal input-outputs and sIPsCs are presented as mean $\pm S \mathrm { E }$ .The comparisons between groups were carried out by $t$ -test.

# Morphological Studies of Cortical Interneurons

# Neurobiotin Staining and Morphological Analysis

The electrodes for whole-cell recording included $0 . 2 \%$ neurobiotin in pipette solution.The solutions were back-filled into the recording pipettes whose tips contained a standard solution. After electrophysiological studies,the slices were rapidly placed into $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde in $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ PBS for fixation at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ about $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .The slices were incubatedin avidin and horseradish peroxidase(Vectastain ABC,Sigma，St.Louis,MO，USA）for $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，andin $1 \%$ DAB- $\mathrm { . c o C l } _ { 2 }$ (Sigma), $1 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ for staining neurobiotin-filled neurons.The reactions were then stopped by PBS [38].Neurobiotin-stained neurons were scanned under laser scanningconfocal microscope(Olympus FV-1ooo， Tokyo, Japan).The density of interneuron processes was analyzed by Neuromantic (Version 1.6,an open source of software produced by Darren Myatt,University of Reading,England).Our analyses included primary dendrites (dendrites directly from the soma; [31],process terminals,and axonal branches in each of inhibitory neurons.The dendrites and axons of neurons were identified based on their diameters and spines. There were no changes in the dendrites and axons of inhibitory neurons in the control and seizure-onset cortices (Figure S3).

# Computational Simulation

The principle of building neural network in computational modelingis described below.Cerebral cortices are composed of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons in the ratio of about $8 0 \%$ versus $2 0 \%$ [45].The axons of inhibitory neurons terminate on excitatory neurons to coordinate their activity [36,46]. The cerebral cortices are divided into numerous regions including a set of neuronal microcircuits,in which excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons are synaptically connected to form input and recurrent excitations as well as feedforward and feedback inhibitions (Figure S4).Excitatory neurons also project to other areas through their long axons,that is,the small-world model [47].Based on these principles,we have constructed the simplified networks for seizure-onset cortices from TLE patients and for the controls.Cortical networks included sixteen areas (i.e.,microcircuits）that presumably presented sixteen areas of seizure onset identified by intracranial EEG (Figure 1).Each area was simplified in a ratio of four excitatory neurons to an inhibitory neuron,such that the total number of neurons in the simplified networks was eighty (64 excitatory neurons and 16 inhibitory neurons).

The neurons in the simulated networks were thought as integrate-fire cell model [48-5O].Their functional status to be introduced into the simulated networks was digitized from our data in Tables 1 and 2.Inhibitory neurons in seizure-onset cortex were divided into two groups in Figures 1-2 (functional downregulationandupregulation)， whichmadeneural network unevenly inhibited (patch-like disinhibition and inhibition).

All of the neurons in our simulated network were connected by excitatory and inhibitory synapses.In each microcircuit,an inhibitory neuron inhibited multiple pyramidal cells and received their excitatory inputs.Pyramidal neurons received synaptic inputs from internal microcircuits.All of these neurons also received excitatory inputs from other microcircuits and subcortical areas. Excitatory synaptic events were characterized as a steady interevent interval $2 0 \pm 1 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ ).The weight of synaptic connection on pyramidal and inhibitory cells in the simulated network was assumed to be similar.

Based on Table 3 values showing changes in excitatory synaptic transmission on interneurons and inhibitory synaptic transmission on pyramidal neurons (Figure 3),we analyzed the strengths of signal transmission at excitatory synapses on inhibitory neurons and at inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neurons (Table 4). These parameters were introduced into the neural networks simulated in our computational modeling.

# Results

Seizure-onset regions in TLE patients were identified by 32 channels of EEG on cortical surface before neurosurgery.A case of EEG recording in temporal lobe cortex is shown in Figure l,where the cortical areas under electrodes l-l6 are identified as the onset of interictal seizure discharge and the areas under 5-7 and 9-1l with the early dominant onsets of discharges (seizure-onset cortices) were harvested for our experiments.

# Inhibitory Neurons in Seizure-onset Cortices are Functionally Downregulated or Unregulated

The ability of inhibitory neurons to convert input signals into spikes in seizure-onset cortices and controls was analyzed by injecting depolarization pulses (l second).Their responses to stimulus currents in fast-spiking pattern were plotted as inputoutput curves (Figure 2).These currents induced the spikes and subthreshold responses at an interneuron in control (green traces in Figure 2B）and two interneurons in seizure-onset cortex (light blues in 2C and dark blues in 2D).Figure 2E illustrates spikes per second versus current intensities in these neurons.The input-output curves and spiking traces are corresponding in their colors.Compared with the control (green trace),two interneurons in seizure-onset cortices appear to have either low (light blue）or high abilities(dark blue） to produce spikes.Figure 2F shows I-V curves for the currents to induce subthreshold voltage changes at these interneurons in the seizure-onset cortices (light blue and dark blue symbols/lines) and controls (greens).

When plotted the input-output curves for each of inhibitory interneurons $( { \mathrm { n } } = 7 2 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ ）inseizure-onset cortices and controls （2 $( \mathrm { n } = 2 0$ ),we saw diversified curves among these neurons in seizure-onset cortices.Based on the values of spikes per second at the initial and middle points of these input-output curves,we plotted the histograms of spikes per second versus number of inhibitory interneurons (symbols in Figure 3A-B),and the fitting curves in these interneurons of seizure-onset cortices (blue traces in Figure 3A-B),and controls (green).Compared toa single peak of distribution for controls,the ability to fire spikes in the inhibitory interneurons from seizure-onset cortices falls into two distributions (light and dark blue traces). $70 \%$ inhibitory neurons possess low ability to fire the spikes and others $( 3 0 \% )$ shift their spikingability to high.Figure 3C illustrates the averaged data for

normalized stimuli versus spikes per second in inhibitory interneurons from seizure-onset cortices (light and dark blue symbols) and controls (greens).

The inhibitory neurons in the seizure-onset cortex are functionally downregulated or upregulated. Some of them have a low spiking ability and others show high ability.We further examined whether their output controls(i.e.，GABAergic synapses） to downstream neurons were functionally differentiated.

# The Output Controls of Inhibitory Neurons in Seizure-Onset Cortices are Differentiated

The ability of inhibitory neurons to control their postsynaptic neurons was evaluated by recording spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC）at the pyramidal neurons [43] in the seizure-onset cortices and controls.

Figure 4 shows the activity of GABAergic synapses in seizureonset cortices $( \mathrm { n } = 1 7$ ）and controls $( \mathrm { n } = 1 0 \$ ).Compared to sIPSCs recorded in the control (bottom trace in 4A)，sIPSC frequency in the seizure-onset cortices appears to be low (sample one in TLE),no change (sample two),and high (sample three). Cumulative probability versus inter-sIPsC intervals in the seizure-onset cortices (blue traces in Figure 4B）and the controls (greens） indicate that sIPSC frequency is downregulated (light blue),normal (blue),or upregulated (dark blue).Using the values of inter-sIPsC-intervals at O.67 cumulative probability，we plotted the histograms of inter-sIPsC intervals versus number of pyramidal neurons (Figure 4C).Compared to a single peak of distribution for GABAergic synapses in controls (green), GABAergic synapses in seizure-onset cortices falls into three distributions,low( $2 4 \%$ of inhibitory synapses)，no change $( 3 5 \% )$ ，and high $( 4 1 \% )$ .Figure 4D from seizure-onset cortices (blue traces) and control (greens) demonstrates that sIPSC frequencies are downregulated (light blue),normal (blues),or upregulated (dark blues).

The inhibitory neurons and their output synapses in human seizure-onset cortices are functionally downregulated or upregulated.Their reduced ability in spike production and synaptic output may make principal neurons escape from inhibitory control for seizure onsets.A portion of inhibitory neurons with highabilities to fire spikes and inhibit target cells may monitor seizure onset and work as an endogenous mechanism to terminate seizure.As it is not allowed to manipulate inhibitory neurons in TLE patients, we examined this hypothesisby computational simulation.

# The Upregulation of Inhibitory Neurons Facilitates Seizure Termination or Vice Versa

We introduced our experimental data into the simulated network to analyze the roles of inhibitory downregulation and upregulation in seizure onset and termination.The simulated microcircuits included principal and inhibitory neurons in the ratio of four to one that were synaptically connected (Figure S4).The output activity of principal neurons was digitized as spike frequencies (calibration bars in Figure 5A).Without the exogenous stimulus to these neurons,their spiking from low to high frequency is thought as spontaneous activity,and intense spiking from all of them are thought as synchronous activity,or vice versa as the activity termination. The activity levels of principal neurons are quantified as the strength and duration of seizure spikes,the latency of seizure onset as well as the cross-correlation of spikes among the neurons (Figure S5).

The distributions of the inhibitory neurons that are functionally downregulated or upregulated in the seizure-onset cortices may be patch-like (a pattern in Figure S4) or large scale.We introduced three patterns into our simulated networks,that is,the patch-like upregulation and downregulation in the inhibitory interneurons (pattern one),all downregulation (pattern two),as well as largescaled upregulation and downregulation (pattern three).If these inhibitory neurons appear as a patch-like pattern of upregulation and downregulation,the outputs of principal neurons express sudden and synchronous seizure spikes (i.e.,seizure onset-to-termination,Figure 5A).The latency,strength,and duration of seizure onsets as well as the cross-correlation of principal neurons show that the seizure termination is only seen in a patch-like distribution of the upregulated inhibitory neurons (Figure 5B-F).As the epilepsy and seizure EEG appear automatically terminated, our results indicate that the patch-like distribution for the upregulated inhibitory neurons is a typical pattern in the seizure cortex of TLE patients.The neurons simulated under the control do not show seizure activity (Figure S6).

In terms of the correlation of the downregulated and upregulated inhibitory synapses with seizure activities in principal neurons, we introduced the different ratios of the upregulated inhibitory synapses to the downregulated ones into the simulated network. In Figure 6，the strength and duration of seizure-onset are affected by the ratio of inhibitory synaptic upregulation to downregulation.An increased ratio appears to lower seizure strength and duration (Figure 6A).Figure 6B-D shows dynamic changes in the latency,duration,strength,and synchrony of seizure activity by upregulating inhibitory synapses.The increase in a portion of the upregulated inhibitory synapses prolongs the latency of seizure onset,reduces the strength,and duration of seizure activity as well as lowers the correlation coefficient of seizure spikes in principal neurons.

To the correlation of the downregulated and upregulated inhibitory neuronal function with seizure activities in principal neurons,we introduced the different ratios of the upregulated inhibitory neurons to the downregulated ones into a simulated network.The strength and duration of seizure onset are affected by the ratio of inhibitory neuronal upregulation to downregulation (Figure 7).The increase in this ratio reduces seizure strength and duration (Figure 7A).As illustrated in Figure 7B-D，the increases in the proportions of the upregulated inhibitory neurons delays seizure onset,reduces seizure strength and duration as well as lowers pyramidal neuron synchrony.

Moreover,the coordinated effects of the upregulated inhibitory synapses and neurons on seizure termination are illustrated in Figure 8.The increases in both upregulated inhibitory neurons and synapses appear to almost terminate seizure activities in principal cells (Figure 8A-B).The increases in the proportion of the upregulated inhibitory synapses and neurons up to $5 0 \%$ can prolong the latency of seizure onset to be unlimited,reduce the strength and duration of seizure toward zero,as well as diminish the correlation coefficient of seizure spikes among principal cells to be the lowest (Figure 8C-F).Thus,the endogenous mechanism for seizure termination can be fulfilled by simultaneously upregulating inhibitory neurons and their output synapses.

# Discussion

In the seizure-onset cortices from neocortical TLE patients as well as the control cortices from non-seizure individuals,we have analyzed the pathophysiological features of inhibitory neurons and their synaptic outputs.Most of the inhibitory neurons in the seizure-onset cortices have a low ability to produce spikes (Figures 2 and 3)and are unable to inhibit their postsynaptic neurons (Figure 4).On the other hand,some inhibitory synapses and neurons in the seizure-onset cortices are functionally upregulated (Figures 2-4). Our computational simulation reveals that the patchlike distribution of the upregulated inhibitory neurons and synapses leads to seizure termination (Figure 5).The simultaneous increases in the proportions of the upregulated inhibitory synapses and neurons synergistically strengthen seizure termination (Figures 6-8).Molecular mechanisms underlying the upregulation versus downregulation in these inhibitory neurons remain to be determined.

The studies in animal models suggest that an imbalance of excitation and inhibition toward neural overexcitation is associated with seizure activity[53-55].These valuable data in seizure pathogenesis remain to be confirmed in epileptic patients,and the data from human seizure tissues would be more convincing if the studies were carried out with controls [l6].Taken these issues with specific-type neurons for seizure discharges into account,we analyzed the characteristics of inhibitory neurons in the seizure-onset cortices from TLE patients and in controls from nonseizure individuals.In addition to a downregulation,a proportion of inhibitory neurons and synapses were functionally upregulated.Our studies support a role of cortical disinhibition in seizure onset. More importantly,our finding about the functional upregulation of inhibitory synapses and neurons in TLE patients brings a notion into endogenous mechanisms underlying seizure termination.

Pathophysiological changes in inhibitory neurons from seizureonset cortices may be a cause of epileptic discharges or consequences induced by long-term epilepsy.The computational simulation based on our experimental data indicates that the downregulation of inhibitory synapses and neurons facilitates principal cells to induce synchronous seizure activity. The increases in the proportions of upregulated inhibitory synapses and neurons reinforce cortical inhibitory networks to terminate seizure discharges (Figures 5-8).Inhibitory neuron-based therapy for epilepsy has been proposed [56].The synergistic influences of upregulating inhibitory neurons and synapses on seizure termination (Figure 8） suggests that epilepsy therapy will benefit from strengthening the functions of multiple subcellular compartments in inhibitory neurons,such as their synaptic sensitivity,intrinsic properties,and GABAergic output.In these regards,the therapeutic strategies for intractable TLE patients should be to raise the number and function of inhibitory neurons synergistically.As stem cells are preferentially differentiated into inhibitory neurons,the stem cell therapy will be the option to increase the number of inhibitory interneurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying the upregulation of inhibitory interneurons have not been developed well,and the approach for specifically enhancing inhibitory neuron function remains to be studied.

Computational simulations for seizure onset based on the studies in epileptic animal models have been carried out by changing one of factors,such as voltage-gated ion channel [57], local neural network [58,59])，small-world versus large-scale network [47,6O],or destabilization for multistate network transition [6l].Computational simulation in this study is based on our data from TLE patients versus controls by introducing multiple factors (such as,neuronal active intrinsic properties and synaptic dynamics） into neural networks.The data read from our simulations under the conditions of specific-type neurons and synapses make the computational neural networks to be closely comprehensive.

In summary,inhibitory neurons and synapses in seizure-onset cortices are differentiated into two functional populations,downregulation and upregulation. The downregulation of inhibitory cellular units leads to seizure onset. Their upregulation constitutes a homeostatic process to strengthen inhibitory units,an endogenous mechanism for seizure termination.The increases in the proportion and function of inhibitory synapses and neurons to synergistically terminate seizure will be useful to treat intractable TLE patients.
