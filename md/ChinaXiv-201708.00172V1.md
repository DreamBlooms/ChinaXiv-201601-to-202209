AbstractNew specimens from a new locality at Chutoulang in eastern Nei Mongol were identifiedas Canis chihliensis,Coelodonta nihowanensis,Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) sinense, Equus sanmeniensis,Sus lydekkeri,Muntiacus cf.M. lacustris,Axis shansius,Eucladoceros boulei,Spirocerus cf.S.wongi and Bison palaeosinensis.They enriched the mammalian fauna of Chutoulang to 30 taxa together with the material from Dongliang,Dongcun Beigou and Dongcun Nangou localities.The mammalian fossls from these four localities are allfrom the same horizon and can be regarded as the same fauna,i.e. Chutoulang fauna. The composition of Chutoulang fauna is the closest to that of Nihewan (s.s.) by binary faunal similarity coefficients.The age of Chutoulang fauna is between those of Nihewan (s.s.） and Juyuandong at Liucheng according to Brainerd-Robinson's sequence,extinction rates and antiquity coeffcients.The numerical age of Chutoulang fauna is estimated between 1.4-1.6 Ma based on those of compared faunas. Carnivora are the most numerous in Chutoulang fauna with 11 taxa,but mostly the small sized ones. Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla make about half of the fauna.They are mostly large sized forms. The presence of numerous browsers or forest dwellrs implies the existence of forest or woodland in Chutoulang area during that period.The presence of grazers and openland dwellrs indicates the existence of larger area of grassland or steppes than that of woodland or forests.Most members of Chutoulang fauna are temperate habitat dwellers with a few cold-prone forms such as Ochotona and Coelodonta.The climate in Chutoulang area in the Early Pleistocene was thus similar to that of today. Chutoulang fauna is the most northeastern Early Pleistocene fauna in China and it can be recommended as a type site of the Early Pleistocene mammalian fauna in northeastern China.

# 1 Introduction

Chutoulang is a small town $( 4 2 ^ { \circ } 1 8 ^ { \prime } 2 8 . 6 8 ^ { \prime \prime } { - 4 2 ^ { \circ } 1 9 ^ { \prime } 1 6 . 7 8 ^ { \prime \prime } } \mathrm { N }$ ， $1 1 8 ^ { \circ } 3 7 ^ { \prime } 2 0 . 3 1 ^ { \prime \prime } -$ $1 1 8 ^ { \circ } 3 8 ^ { \prime } 2 3 . 8 7 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ about $2 2 . 5 \mathrm { k m }$ west (heading: $2 8 7 ^ { \circ }$ ）of Chifeng City and $3 2 9 . 6 \mathrm { k m }$ northeast (headings: $3 4 . 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ . ~ }$ ）ofBeijing City.It is administratively belong to Chifeng Municipality of Nei Mongol Autonomous Region and was belong to former Jehol Province (1928-1955) and Liaoning Province (1969-1979). During a field investigation in 1986 around Dongliang village of Chutoulang, Zhang and his students found a fossil assemblage from fluvial-lacustrine deposits (Zhang,1989).A follow-up excavation yielded about 18 taxa of mammalian fossils: Ochotona sp.,Marmota sp.,Microtus sp., Vulpes sp.,Meles leucurus,Meles sp., Panthera sp.,Poguma sp.,Hipparion sp.,Proboscidipparion sinense,Equus sanmeniensis, Coelodonta antiquitatis, Axis rugosus, Cervus (Sika) grayi, Cervinae gen. et sp. indet., Procapreolus sp., Gazelle sinensis,Bison palaeosinensis.The fossil assemblage was regarded as with the same age as that of Xihoudu Paleolithic site and that of Xicun fauna in Shanxi Province.And the deposits bearing the fossils were named as Dongliang Formation (Zhang,1989).

The follow-up excavations from 1986 to 1987 extended from Dongliang to Beigou and Nangou around Dongcun (Dong Village) of Chutoulang,and the mammalian fossils collected from these two localities include 21 taxa: Procynocephalus wimani, Canis variabilis, C.chihliensis var. palmidens,Nyctereutes sinensis, Ursus sp.,Hyaena licenti,Panthera tigris,Acinonyx sp.,Hipparion sp.,H. (Proboscidipparion) sinensis,Equus sanmeniensis, Nestoritherium sp.,Rhinoceros cf.R. sinensis,Coelodonta antiquitatis,Sus lydekkeri, Gazella sinensis, Gazella cf. G. subguturosa, Cervus sp., Bison palaeosinensis,Bos sp., Paracamelus gigas (You and Zhang, 1989).

The presence of the “dragon bone”,i.e. mammalian fossils,at Chutoulang not only interested paleontologists, but also illegal fossil hunters.The illegal diggings occurred more and more frequently in recent years and the local government carried out a protection project under the supervision of the Department of Land Resources of Nei Mongol Autonomous Region in order to collect the fossils before the illegal fossl dealers to trade them in black markets.An authorized paleontological excavation was conducted in 2012 at Xiaonanshan fosil locality of Chutoulang,and many new specimens of mammalian fossils were collected which form the material of the present study. The new specimens numbered with prefix of CTL (Chutoulang) are housed in the Division of Land Resources of Songshan District, Chifeng City, Nei Mongol.

Xiaonanshan fossil locality (see online supplementary Google Earth location or visit web address on Baidu Maps at ${ < \mathrm { h t t p } { : } / / \mathrm { j } }$ .map.baidu. $\mathrm { c o m / W 8 F D B > } )$ islocated $2 . 1 3 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ northeast (heading: 54.13) of Chutoulang and ranges from $4 2 ^ { \circ } 1 9 ^ { \prime } 4 3 . 3 0 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { N }$ to $4 2 ^ { \circ } 1 9 ^ { \prime } 4 6 . 6 6 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { N }$ and from $1 1 8 ^ { \circ } 3 9 ^ { \prime } 0 7 . 0 1 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E }$ to $1 1 8 ^ { \circ } 3 9 ^ { \prime } 1 6 . 0 6 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E }$ with an average altitude of $6 8 8 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ . The fossils were unearthed from a main layer of reddish and brownish clay or sandy clay with a thickness of 5-7 m and with a sandwiched layer of grayish silt, especially in or near the sandwiched layer of silt.The main layer corresponds to the lower part of Dongliang Formation yielding mammalian fossils (Zhang, 1989; You and Zhang,1989).

According to Zhang (1989), Dongliang fossil locality is likely around today's Shahudong Village and about $1 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ south of Xiaonanshan locality. Beigou locality of You and Zhang (1989) is north of today's Dahedong Village and probably about $1 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ north of Xiaonanshan locality according to the local habitants participated the excavations by Zhang (1989). And Nangou locality of You and Zhang (1989) is very near today's Xiaonanshan locality. Allfossils were collected from lower part of a series of fluvial-lacustrine deposits named as Dongliang Formation by Zhang (1989).

2 Systematic paleontology

Material A left M1(CTL23-2,crown length: $1 2 . 9 2 \mathrm { m m }$ ,width: $1 6 . 0 9 \mathrm { m m }$ ,height: $8 . 5 6 \mathrm { m m }$ and a broken left m1 (CTL46-6,length: ${ > } 1 4 . 9 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ,width: $9 . 1 \mathrm { m m }$ ,height: $1 4 . 2 \mathrm { m m }$ ）

RemarksBoth M1 and broken ml show no wear facet and therefore are relatively young. The specimens are morphologically similar to those of Canis chihliensis from

Xiashagou described by Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau (193O) and close to those from Shanshenmiaozui (Tong et al.,2O12). They are metrically smaller than those of $C .$ chihliensis from Xiashagou and Shanshenmiaozui but similar to those of $C .$ ，chihliensis var.parmidens and $C .$ .chihliensis var. minor from Xiashagou (Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau, 1930). The taxonomic status of $C$ 、chihliensis var. parmidens is controversial (Qiu et al. 2oo4),and $C .$ （2 chihliensis var. minor was included into the late Neogene form Eucyon (Tedford and Qiu, 1996). The present specimens indicate that there existed at Xiaonanshan a kind of relatively small canid similar to $C$ ，chihliensis with some archaic aspects.

Canis chihliensis is absent at Dongliang locality (Zhang, 1989), but present at Dongcun localities as $C .$ . chihliensis var. parmidens (You and Zhang,1989). The latter is considered here as $C .$ chihliensis together with that from Xiaonanshan.

Material A rightDP4 (CTL19-1).Length: $4 9 . 5 7 \mathrm { m m }$ ,width: $4 4 . 9 0 \mathrm { m m }$ ,height: $3 9 . 5 3 \mathrm { m m }$

RemarksThe crown height of DP4 is moderate and the occlusal view of the crown outline is nearly triangular. The enamel layer is well preserved and the cavity inside of enamel layer is very large. The ectoloph is undulated,anterior fossette is large and connected with wide middle fossette,while the posterior fossette is short and wide.

Chutoulang specimen is close to that of Rhinoceros cf. R. tichorhinus described by Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau (193O) which was later defined as Coelodonta nihowanensis by Kahlke (1969). It is also close to that of $C .$ nihowanensis from Longdan (Qiu et al., 2004) both morphologically and metrically.

Fig.2 A righ DP4 (CTL19-1) of Coelodonta nihowanensis from Xiaonanshan Locality in occlusal (A), lingual (B) and buccal (C) views

The left M1,right M1,left p4 and right $\mathrm { m } 2$ of the“Coelodonta antiquitatis”from Dongliang locality described by Zhang (1989) are evidently smaller and more archaic than those of the Late Pleistocene $C$ 、antiquitatis(Zhang,1989) and they are actually $C$ nihowanensis. The $^ { 6 6 } C$ ， antiquitatis” from Dongcun localities mentioned by You and Zhang (1989) is the same case.

Perissodactyla Owen, 1848 Equidae Gray, 1821 Hipparion de Christol, 1832 Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) Sefve, 1927 Hipparion(Proboscidipparion) sinense Sefve,1927 (Fig.3)

Material A left third metacarpal with reduced and broken second and forth metacarpals (CTL33-1),a left third proximal phalange (CTL26).

![](images/f27f00759a2d70e48af0a44b3f57df8e8955f59ce8b1061fc13f725fc4df9d5c.jpg)  
Fig.3Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) sinense from Xiaonanshan Locality A left third metacarpal with reduced and broken second and forth metacarpals (CTL33-1) in posterior (A), anterior (B)and proximal (C) views;and a left third proximal phalanx (CTL26) in proximal (D), posterior (E) and anterior (F) views

RemarksThe left metacarpal III (CTL33-1) is well preserved with just a few minor fractures (Fig.3A-C). The lateral and medial sides of the distal part of metacarpal II show facets of contact with metacarpals I and IV, an evidence of typical hipparion,although metacarpals II and IV are preserved just two thirds of proximal parts and their distal third parts are broken off (Fig. 3A).

The proximal-distal length of metacarpal II (CTL33-1) measures $2 6 7 . 6 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ ,the anterioposterior diameter and the medial-lateral diameter in the middle of metacarpal II are 32.6 and $3 5 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ respectively. The medial-lateral and anterio-posterior diameters of proximal facet with carpals measure 51.5 and $4 0 . 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ respectively.And those of distal facet with proximal phalanx III are 44.9 and $3 6 . 9 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ respectively. The metacarpals (CTL33-1） are very similar to those of Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) sinense from Yushe Basin (Qiu et al.,1987) and Longdan (Qiu et al., 2004).

The left third proximal phalange (CTL26) is stout, with moderately expanded proximal and distal condyles (Fig. 3D-F). Its length is $7 9 . 2 \mathrm { m m }$ ,its anterio-posterior diameter is $3 7 . 3 \mathrm { m m }$ at the proximal, $3 0 . 0 \mathrm { m m }$ in the middle and $2 4 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ at the distal; its medial-lateral diameter is $4 0 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m }$ at the proximal, $4 3 . 3 \mathrm { m m }$ at the distal.

Some isolated cheek teeth with isolated protocone in upper cheek teeth from Dongliang locality were included into Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) sinense (Zhang,1989).The species was also reported present at Dongcun localities (You and Zhang,1989).

# EquusLinnaeus,1758 EquussanmeniensisTeilharddeChardin&Piveteau,1930 (Fig. 4; Table 1)

MaterialA right mandibular fragment with $\mathrm { { p } } 2 \mathrm { { - m } } 3$ (CTL42-1),a left mandibular fragment with p3-m3 (CTL42-2),an anterior part of a mandible with all incisors and some cheek teeth (CTL39-1-1),a mandibular symphysis with all incisors (TCL34-2),a right mandibular fragment with $\scriptstyle \mathbf { m } 2 - 3$ (CTL30-2),a left M3 (CTL18-1),a left p3 (CTL12-3),a left p4 (CTL14), a right ml (CTL12-2), a left m2 (CTL12-5), a left m3 (CTL12-1), a left and a right talus (CTL34-1, CTL07-1),a left proximal third phalange (TCL33-5).

Remarks The specimens of the species are the most numerous among the Xiaonanshan material. The protocone of M3(CTL18-1) is long and nearly triangular in occlusal view and connected to protoconule. The tooth is covered by a cement layer,especially on the lingual side.There are five incomplete lower dentitions.The double-knots pattern of the lower cheek teeth is stenonid.

Xiaonanshan specimens are morphologically close to those of Equus sanmeniensis, e.g. the mesostyle of M3 is simple and not folded, its protocone is long; and the pattern of double-knots in lower cheek teeth is stenonid, ectoflexid extends into the neck of doubleknots.The dimensions of Xiaonanshan specimens are relatively large and close to those of E.sanmeniensis from Xiashagou of Nihewan (Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau, 1930), $E$ huanghoensis from Luping (Chow and Liu,1959) and Tuozidong (Dong and Fang,2005) and $E$ eisenmannae from Longdan (Qiu et al., 2Oo4),but evidently larger than those of $E$ przewalskii and $E$ .dalianensis from Longgushan (Zhou et al., 1985).

Material A right maxillary fragment with DP2-4 (CTL1O), a left mandibular fragment with p2-3 (CTL11),a left mandibular fragment with p2-3 and dp4 (CTL16).

RemarksThe suid material is fragmental, only juvenile maxillary and mandibular fragments are available. The teeth are typical of suid type.DP4 and dp4 are completely molarized (Fig. 5A-B,F). The p2 and p3 are composed of a main cusp and a few accessory cusplets (Fig. 5C-F). The available morphological and metric as well as stratigraphic data of the material are in accordance with those of Sus lydekkeri.

Sus lydekkeri was not reported from Dongliang locality (Zhang,1989),but present at Dongcun localities (You and Zhang,1989).

Material A right maxillary fragment with M2-3 (CTL22-1),a left mandibular fragment with $\scriptstyle \mathrm { m } 2 - 3$ (CTL04-2).

Remarks The molars are relatively small(Table 3) and typically selenodont with moderate crown height.The accessory elements such as entostyle (basal pillar), enamel folds on the crests of the main cusps are present in upper molars (Fig. 6A), while precingulid and ectostylid (basal pillar) are present in lower molars (Fig. 6B). The specimens are evidently larger than those of moschids and are morphometrically of muntjacs. Xiaonanshan specimens are metrically within the range of those of Muntiacus lacustris from the Early Pleistocene deposits of Gigantopithecus Cave of Liucheng (Han,1987) and Dadong( $\mathbf { \bar { \rho } } = \mathbf { \rho }$ Sanhe Cave) of Chongzuo (Dong et al., 2011). Unfortunately the antler material is not available at Xiaonanshan.

The muntjacs were not reported from Dongliang locality (Zhang,1989) and Dongcun localities (You and Zhang,1989). But a moderate cervid Procapreolus sp. represented by a mandibular fragment with $\scriptstyle \mathrm { m } 2 - 3$ was reported from Dongliang (Zhang, 1989). The cervids from Dongcun localities are only a Cervus sp.(You and Zhang,1989). Xiaonanshan specimens are slightly larger than those of Procapreolus jinensis from the Late Miocene deposits of Yushe Basin (Dong and Ye,1996),as well as those of extant Capreolus capreolus housed at

RemarksThe M3 is composed of four selenodont main cusps and without evident accessory elements such as enamel fold on the crests of the lingual main cusps and cingula. The $\mathrm { m } 2$ and $\mathbf { m } 3$ are also composed with selenodont main cusps with weak precingulid and ectocingulid as well as developed ectostylid (basal pillar).

The specimens represent a relatively large cervid (see Table 3 for measurements). The only cervid with similar size in the Early Pleistocene is Eucladoceros boulei from Nihewan Basin (Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau,193O) and Xiaonanshan specimens can also be regarded as the same species although there is no antler material. Eucladoceros boulei was not reported from either Dongliang (Zhang,1989) or Dongcun (You and Zhang,1989) localities and it is its first discovery in Chutoulang area.

AxisSmith,1827 AxisshansiusTeilharddeChardin&Trassaert,1937 (Fig.6E-G; Table 3)

MaterialA maxillary fragment with both left and right P3-M3 (CTL05-1), a right maxillary fragment with M2-3 (CTL12-10),a left mandibular fragment with $\mathrm { { p 4 } \mathrm { { - m 3 } } }$ (CTL42-6), a left calcaneus (CTL02-2) and a left talus (CTL07-2).

RemarksThe P3 is composed of two fused lobes with an evident entoflexus,and P4 a single lobe without entoflexus. The M1-3 are all composed of four selenodont main cusps with evident spur, entocingulum and entostyle (basal pillar),the other accessory elements are absent.The precingulid and ectostylid (basal pillar) are evident in all lower molars.The first lobe is longer than the second one in ml and $\mathrm { m } 2$ ,but nearly equal in $\mathbf { m } 3$ . The third lobe of $\mathbf { m } 3$ is relatively small. Xiaonanshan specimens are evidently smaller than those of Elaphurus bifurcatus, Eucladoceros boulei and Cervus (Rusa) elegans from Nihewan (Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau,1930) but close to those of Axis shansius from Yushe Basin (Teilhard de Chardin and Trassaert, 1937) and Dajushan (Dong,2006).

The body of calcaneus (CTLO2-2) is relatively short with a length of $6 6 . 5 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and an anterior-posterior diameter of $4 0 . 8 9 ~ \mathrm { { m m } }$ ， the anterio-posterior diameter of calcaneal tuber measures $3 4 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，the sustentaculum tali and coracoid process are developed. The proximal trochlea is more developed than that of the distal in the talus (CTLO7-2),and the transversal and anterio-posterior diameters of the proximal trochlea are 46.89 and $3 5 . 6 7 \ \mathrm { m m }$ respectively, and those of the distal are 44.28 and $3 4 . 0 5 \mathrm { m m }$ respectively.

The reported fragmental material of “Cervus (Sika) grayi’ from Dongliang (Zhang,1989) can also be regarded as Axis shansius because Cervus (Sika) grayi is mostly present in the Middle Pleistocene and Dongliang specimens are also morphologically close to those of Axis shansius from Yushe.

(Fig. 7A-B; Table 3)

Material Aleft mandibular fragment wit $\mathrm { m } 2 { - } \mathrm { m } 3$ (CTL18-2).

Remarks The $\scriptstyle \mathrm { m } 2 - 3$ are high crowned without accessory elements such as cingula and ectostylid (basal pillar),the lingual main cusps are higher than those of the buccal side, the crests of the main cusps are sharp.All these characters indicate an antelope. The specimens are morphologically close to those of Spirocerus wongi from Nihewan (Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau, 1930),but the dimensions are slightly smaller.

Gazella sinensis was reported from Dongliang locality (Zhang,1989). It was also reported from Dongcun localities together with Gazella cf. G. subgutturosa (You and Zhang, 1989). Both of the gazelles are evidently smaller than Spirocerus wongi.

Bovinae Gray, 1821 Bison Smith,1827 Bisonpalaeosinensis TeilharddeChardin&Piveteau,1930 (Fig.7C-D; Table 3)

Material A right mandibular fragment with m1-2 (CTL27).

RemarksThe material is very limited at Xiaonanshan Locality,but the specimen CTL27 is clearly of a bovine,e.g. the crowns are very high, the ectostylids (basal pilar) and the enamel folds of the main cusp crests are developed.A primitive bovine, Bison palaeosinensis was reported from Dongliang locality (Zhang,1989). It is represented by a complete horn core with partial frontal, four isolated upper molars and a pair of mandibles with cheek dentitions.

It was also reported from Dongcun localities (You and Zhang,1989). Xiaonanshan specimen is therefore very likely of Bison palaeosinensis although the frontal appendages are absent.

# 3 Fauna analyses

All specimens collected from 20l2's excavation can be thus identified into 1O taxa as mentioned above,and among which Muntiacus cf.M. lacustris, Eucladoceros boulei and Spirocerus cf. S. wongi are newly identified taxa in Chutoulang area. Together with those from Dongliang locality (Zhang,1989)and Dongcun localities (Youand Zhang,1989),the identified mammalian taxa from Chutoulang area total 30: Procynocephalus wimani; Ochotona sp.; Marmota sp.; Microtus sp.; Vulpes sp.; Canis variabilis; Canis chihliensis;Nyctereutes sinensis;Meles meles ( $\mathbf { \bar { \rho } } = \mathbf { \rho }$ leucurus); Meles sp.; Poguma sp.; Ursus sp.; Pachycrocuta brevirostris licenti ( $\fallingdotseq$ Hyaena licenti); Panthera tigris; Acinonyx sp.; Rhinoceros cf.R. sinensis; Coelodonta nihowanensis; Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) sinensis; Equus sanmeniensis;Nestoritherium sp.; Sus lydekkeri; Paracamelus gigas; Muntiacus cf. M. lacustris; Axis shansius; A. rugosus; Eucladoceros boulei; Spirocerus cf. S. wongi; Gazella sinensis; G.cf. G. subgutturosa; Bison palaeosinensis. They were unearthed from the same horizon,i.e.a layer of reddish and brownish clay or sandy clay with a sandwiched layer of grayish silt, the fossil localities are close to each other,and all taxa can therefore be regarded as the same fauna,i.e. Chutoulang fauna.

Material and methodsIn order to find the compositional, zoogeographic and biochronological positions of Chutoulang fauna, some representative Early Pleistocene faunas from different areas of China and with the taxon number above 3O such as Nihewan (s.s.) (Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau,1930; Qiu,2000; Tong et al.,2011) in northern China, Gongwangling (Hu and Qi,1978) and Longdan (Qiu et al., 2004) in northwestern China, Renzidong (Jin and Liu,20o9) in eastern China,Longgupo (Huang and Fang,1991） and Longgudong (Zheng, 2004) in central China, Juyuandong (Pei, 1987; Han,1987) and Dadong (Jin et al., 2Oo9) in southern China, were selected for comparison.A French fauna from upper Saint-Vallier (LD3)(Guerin et al.,20o4) was also selected as a classic European Villafranchian fauna for comparison.

Because the presence or absence of a taxon in a fauna is a binary variable, the matching coefficients between binary variables can be used to evaluate the similarity of two faunas (Chen, 1983,2005). If taxon $k$ is either present or absent both in fauna $i$ and fauna $j$ ，we define the matching coefficient of taxon $k$ 1 $\mathbf { ( R } _ { i j k } )$ in the paired faunas as $\mathrm { R } _ { i j k } = 1$ ; if taxon $k$ is only present either in fauna $i$ or fauna $j$ ,we define the matching coefficient of taxon $k ( \mathbb { R } _ { i j k } )$ in the faunas as $\mathrm { R } _ { i j k } = 0$ . In the case some taxon can only be identified at genus or family level, the matching coefficient is defined as $\mathrm { R } _ { i j k } = 0 . 5$ .The binary faunal similarity coefficient of two compared faunas $( \mathrm { R } _ { i j } )$ is defined as the double sum of the matching coefficients of all taxa of the paired faunas:

$$
\mathbb { R } _ { i j } = 2 \times \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { n } \mathbb { R } _ { i j k }
$$

All extinct taxa, including regional extinct ones, from all compared faunas were considered as a presumed archaic fauna and those of extant taxa as a presumed modern fauna. All compared faunas as well as the presumed archaic and modern faunas were compared with each other in pairs to find all binary faunal similarity coefficients. The latter were then sequenced by antiquity coeficients which was defined as the binary faunal similarity coefficient between a fauna and the presumed archaic fauna (Dong et al., 2Ol3; Dong,2016), and they were also ranked according to Brainerd-Robinson's (B.-R.) rule (Chen,2005) in ascending order from the youngest to the oldest (Table 4). The fauna extinction rate is as classically defined as the percentage of extinct taxa number over total taxa number of the fauna.It is often the case that each fauna being sorted in different position in different sequence by corresponding criterion. In order to get a comprehensive result, we define a B.-R. index for each fauna in B.-R.sequence as its sequence position number (Table 5).We define an extinction index of a fauna $k$ s $E _ { x k } ,$ the maximal extinction rate of the compared faunas as $E _ { m a x } ,$ （204号 the minimal extinction rate as $E _ { m i n } ,$ the number of compared faunas as $n$ , the extinction rate of the fauna $k$ as $E _ { k } ,$ the extinction index $E _ { x k }$ of the fauna $k$ can then be calculated by the following formula:

$$
E _ { x k } = ( E _ { k } - E _ { m i n } ) \div [ ( E _ { m a x } - E _ { m i n } ) \div ( n - 1 ) ] + 1
$$

The antiquity index of a fauna is defined and calculated in the same way by replacing the extinction rates with the antiquity coeffcients of the faunas (Table 5).We sum up then three indices of a fauna in each sequence as its combined index,and sort the faunas in ascending order according to their combined indices.

ResultsAll binary faunal similarity coeficients of compared faunas mentioned above are listed in Table 4.In terms of binary faunal similarity coefficients (Table 4),the most similar fauna to that of Chutoulang is that of Nihewan (s.s.) (541),followed by those of Longdan and Dadong (527), Juyuandong and Gongwangling (521), that of Saint-Vallier (497),Longgudong (447), Renzidong (443), and lastly Longgupo (437). But in terms of sequenced binary similarity coefficients according to Brainerd-Robinson's rule (Table 4),the most similar faunas to that of Chutoulang are those of Longdan and Juyuandong, followed by those of Nihewan (s.s.） and Dadong, Saint-Vallier and Longgudong, Gongwangling and Longgupo, and lastly that of Renzidong.

As listed in Table 5,Chutoulang fauna is the fifth youngest one among all compared faunas according to Brainerd-Robinson's rule.

# 4 Discussion and conclusion

Based on binary faunal similarity coefficients (Table 4),the relationship between Chutoulang fauna and that of Nihewan (s.s.） is the closest. It is in accordance with their zoogeographic context. But in terms of sequenced binary similarity coeficients according to B.-R.'s rule (Table 4),the most similar faunas to that of Chutoulang are those of Longdan and Juyuandong.The close relationship between Chutoulang and Longdan is also found in binary faunal similarity coeffcients and these faunas are both in Palaeoarctic region.But with Juyuandong of Oriental region, it can be interpreted only by their biochronological context (Table 5). Although Saint-Vallier fauna is geographically the farthest among all compared ones, it is not the least similar fauna to that of Chutoulang both in view of binary faunal similarity coefficients and according to B.-R.'s sequence.It might indicate that Chutoulang fauna and that of Saint-Vallier were in the same zoogeographic region (Palaeoarctic) as well as similar biochronological period.

The age of Chutoulang fauna was regarded equivalent to that of Nihewan (s.s.) (Zhang, 1989; You and Zhang,1989). Chutoulang fauna is biochronologcially the closest to that of Longdan and Juyuandong according to B.-R.'s sequence, the closest to that of Longgudong and Juyuandong in terms of antiquity coefficients, the closest to that of Renzidong and Nihewan (s.s.) in view of extinction rates and between those of Nihewan and Juyuandong with regards to combined evaluating criteria (Table 5).

The combined correlations also indicate that the faunas of Nihewan (s.s.), Longgupo, Saint-Vallier and Longdan are biochronologically very close to each other, the differences between their combined indices are very small. Indeed, Nihewan (s.s.） fauna resides in the Matuyama reverse chron between the pre-Reunion Matuyama and the post-Olduvai Matuyama chrons with an estimated age of ca.2.2-1.7 Ma (Liu et al., 2012); the age of Longgupo fauna from the middle zone of the cave deposits was estimated from $1 . 1 2 \ \mathrm { M a }$ by ESR to $1 . 9 6 ~ \mathrm { M a }$ by paleomagnetism (Huang et al.,1995); the Saint-Vallier fauna which is one of the standard middle Villafranchian faunas equivalent to biozone MNQ17 was correlated to Chron C2r between 1.95 and $2 . 5 8 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (Sen,2oo4) and generally accepted as about $2 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (Guérin et al., 2004); Longdan fauna was dated with paleomagnetism as $2 . 5 5 { - 2 . 1 6 } \mathrm { M a }$ and generally regarded as $2 . 2 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (Qiu et al., 2Oo4). Juyuandong fauna has not yet been dated by paleomagnetic, ESR nor other physic or chemical methods. Longgudong fauna was dated paleomagnetically as

2.42-2.15 Ma (Zheng, 20o4) but it was questioned and Longgudong fauna was considered as younger than that of Longgupo (Jin et al., 2Oo9). Dadong fauna was dated also by paleomagnetism as $1 . 2 \ \mathrm { M a }$ (Jin et al., 2oo9). The numerical age of Chutoulang fauna should therefore be younger than $1 . 8 \mathrm { M a }$ and older than $1 . 2 \mathrm { M a }$ ,and likely about $1 . 4 { - } 1 . 6 \mathrm { M a }$

The identified new material from Xiaonanshan locality of Chutoulang totals ten taxa: Canis chihliensis,Coelodonta nihowanensis,Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) sinense,Equus sanmeniensis,Sus lydekkeri,Muntiacus cf.M.lacustris,Axis shansius,Eucladoceros boulei, Spiroceruscf.S.wongi and Bison palaeosinensis.

Xiaonanshan is the fourth fossil locality of Chutoulang besides previously uncovered Dongliang, Dongcun Beigou and Dongcun Nangou localities. The mammalian fossils from these four localities are allfrom the same horizon and can be regarded as the same fauna, i.e. Chutoulang fauna.

Carnivora are the most numerous in Chutoulang fauna with 1l taxa,but mostly the small sized ones.The taxa of Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla make about half of the fauna. They are mostly large sized animals. The presence of numerous browsers or forest dwellers such as Procynocephalus wimani, Poguma sp., Ursus sp., Panthera tigris,Rhinoceros cf. R.sinensis,Nestoritherium sp., Sus lydekkeri, Muntiacus cf.M. lacustris,Axis shansius,A. rugosus, Eucladoceros boulei implies the existence of forest or woodland in Chutoulang area. The presence of grazers and openland dwellers such as Ochotona sp.， Marmota sp., Microtus sp., Vulpes sp., Canis variabilis,C.chihliensis,Nyctereutes sinensis,Pachycrocuta brevirostris licenti( $\mathbf { \bar { \Psi } } = \mathbf { \Psi }$ Hyaena licenti),Acinonyx sp.,Coelodonta nihowanensis,Hipparion (Proboscidipparion) sinensis,Equus sanmeniensis,Spirocerus cf. S.wongi, Gazella sinensis, $G$ cf.G. subgutturosa,Bison palaeosinensis indicates larger area of grassland or steppes than that of woodland or forests.The most members of Chutoulang fauna are temperate habitat dwellers with a few cold prone forms such as Ochotona and Coelodonta. The climate in Chutoulang area in the Early Pleistocene was thus similar to that of today.

Chutoulang fauna is the most northeastern Early Pleistocene mammalian fauna in China and it can be recommended as a type site of the Early Pleistocene mammalian fauna in northeastern China.

摘要：出土于内蒙古赤峰初头朗小南山地点的哺乳动物化石新材料有直隶犬(Canischihliensis)，泥河湾披毛犀(Coelodonta nihowanensis)，中国长鼻三趾马(Hipparion(Proboscidipparion) sinense),三门马(Equus sanmeniensis),李氏野猪(Sus lydekkeri),湖麂相似种(Muntiacus cf.M.lacustris),山西轴鹿(Axis shansius),布氏真枝角鹿(Eucladoceros boulei),翁氏转角羚羊(Spirocerus cf.S.wongi)及古中华野牛(Bison palaeosinensis)。加上此前在初头朗东梁、东村北沟和东村南沟3个地点出土的标本，初头朗一带出土的哺乳动物化石种类增加到30个。初头朗4个地点的哺乳动物化石产自同一层位，属于同一个动物群。根据动物群的二元相似性系数，初头朗动物群在组成上最接近狭义泥河湾动物群。综合Brainerd-Robinson排序结果、动物群古老系数和动物群中绝灭种类的百分比，初头朗动物群的时代介于狭义泥河湾动物群和柳城巨猿洞动物群之间；而根据与相关动物群年龄值的对比，初头朗动物群的年龄值约在1.4-1.6 Ma之间。初头朗动物群中的食肉目种类有11个，但大多为小型种类。奇蹄目和偶蹄目种类的总和占动物群总数的一半，大多为体型较大的种类。该动物群中的嫩食者和林栖者指示当时存在一定范围的森林和林地；而动物群中的粗食者及开阔地栖息者指示当时存在面积较大的草原和草甸。初头朗动物群的大部分种类是喜温动物，喜冷种类只有鼠兔和披毛犀，因此当时的气候与现今大致相同。在地理位置上初头朗动物群是我国最靠北和最靠东的早更新世动物群，因此可以推荐为东北地区的早更新世哺乳动物群典型地点。
