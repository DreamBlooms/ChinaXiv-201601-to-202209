# Introduction

Oxidative stress-induced neuronal death has been implicated as a crucial factorin neuronal diseases,includingAlzheimer's disease (AD),Parkinson's disease,and stroke (Markesbery and Carney, 1999; Jenner,2003; Chong et al.,2005). The primary cause of oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the elimination of ROS by antioxidants.If excessive ROS production is induced due to aging, environmental changes or ischemia/reperfusion, this balance is lost, damaging cells.Our earlier studies elucidated several pathways that respond to oxidative stress and mediate neuronal death (Lehtinen et al., 2006; Xiao et al.,2011; Liu et al.,2012; Xie et al., 2012).

FOXO3a is an important transcription factor that is involved in the responses to oxidative stress,apoptosis,metabolism, muscle atrophy,lifespan,and other cellular processes (Brunet et al., 2004; Sandri et al., 2004; Gross et al., 2008; Tao et al., 2013). The mechanism by which FOXO3a regulates its downstream genes varies depending on the cell type and the stimulus.Different conditions induce profound effects on FOXO3a activity and target selection. The classical mechanism of FOXO3a activity regulation is mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway (Brunet et al., 1999).Acetylation and methylation of FOXO3a are also known to affect FOXO3a transcriptional activity (Wang et al., 2007; Calnan etal.,2012).Ubiquitination of FOXO by SKP2 decreases its stability (Huang et al.,2Oo5).Recent reports have proposed that FOXO3a forms distinct complexes to differentially regulate its target genes (Li et al.,2O1O).The mechanism by which oxidative stress modulates the formation ofFOXO3a complexes remains to be elucidated.

It is well known that epigenetic modification regulates gene transcription.Histone acetyltransferases (HATs）and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are two classes of enzymes that modulate histone acetylation.Excessive HATs increase the histone acetylation level,leading to chromatin remodeling,and therefore,enhanced transcription complex binding and gene transcription.HDACs reverse this process and silence gene transcription (Narlikar et al., 2002).HDAC inhibitors (HDACis)killcancer cells by promoting cell-cycle repressor and apoptotic gene expression (Richon et al., 2000; Zhao et al.,2005; Khan and La Thangue,2012). Interestingly,HDACis,such as trichostatin Aand sodium butyrate,protect neurons from oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo (Langley et al.,2008). Some evidence showed that the p53/PUMA signaling pathway contributes to the neuroprotective activity of HDACis (Uo et al., 2009; Brochier et al.,2013). The endogenous HDACi D- $\cdot \beta$ -hydroxybutyrate was found to protect mice from oxidative stress via FOXO3a and its downstream genes (Shimazu et al.,2013).

In this study,we reveal thatHDAC1 and HDAC2 interact with FOXO3a.HDAC2 mediates oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis ina FOXO3a-dependent manner. $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ attenuates the interaction between FOXO3a and HDAC2.The releaseof HDAC2 leads to increased expression of p2l,and p21 is partially responsible for the beneficial effects of HDAC2 knockdown. HDAC2 phosphorylation at S394 affects its binding affinity to FOXO3a.We propose a link between FOXO3a and an epigenetic modification that mediates the cellularresponse to oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis.

Tandemaffinity purification.The tandemaffinitypurification(TAP) assay was described previously (Wang et al.,2O11). In brief, $^ { 8 \mathrm { ~ L ~ } }$ of suspended HeLa cells stably transfected with pOZ-Flag-HA-FOXO3a were collected and washed with cold phosphate buffer solution.The cells were treatedwith $4 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ ofhypotonic buffer ( $\mathrm { \dot { \Omega } } 1 0 \mathrm { \ m M }$ Tris-HCl, pH7.3, $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$

KCl, 1.5 mM $\mathrm { \ M g C l } _ { 2 }$ ).They were homogenized, and the nuclear fraction was collected. The FOXO3a complex was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extracts using anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich）and anti-HA beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology） sequentially.Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to all of the solutions in this experiment. The final eluate from the anti-HA beads was digested using trypsin and subsequently analyzed via mass spectrometry.

Cell culture,transfection,and celldeath assay. The 293T and HT-22 cell lines were cultured in high-glucose DMEM(Invitrogen） supplemented with $1 0 \%$ fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen）and $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { \ U / m l }$ penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were cultured inan incubatorat $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ supplied with $5 \%$ （204号 $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ .The 293T andHT-22 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen).The isolation and culture of cerebellar granule neurons was previously described (Konishi et al.,2002).In brief,CGNs were obtained from 7-d-old C57BL/6 mice unless stated otherwise.After $3 \mathrm { d }$ in vitro (DIV),the CGNs were transfected as described previously (Konishi et al.,2002). Under these conditions,the plasmids were effectively cotransfected into the neurons. Transfected 6 DIV CGNs were treated with $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ 一 $( 6 0 - 1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M } )$ diluted in DMEMimmediately before use.After $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ treatment for $2 4 \ \mathrm { h } .$ ，the neuronal apoptosis assay was performed using a Zeiss Imager Dl microscope as described previously (Xie et al.,20l2).The neurons were classified as live or dead neurons according to the appearance of Hoechst 33258 dye（Sigma-Aldrich） staining.GFP-positive neurons were counted in a blinded manner. In total,150-2o0 cells per slide were counted for each experiment.

Lentivirus packagingand production ofstable $s h$ -RNA-expressing cell clones.A pLKO.1 vector containing an sh-RNA sequence was cotransfected with VSV-G and pCMV-dR8.12 plasmids into 293T cells.Viruses were collected from the supernatant at 36 and $7 2 \mathrm { h }$ after transfection.Ultracentrifugation was performed to enrich the virus concentration.Stably knocked down HT-22 cell clones were established by infecting the cells with the corresponding lentivirus.A virus produced from the pLKO.1 empty vector was used to generate control cells.The cells were selected in complete medium containing 2 $\mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ puromycin $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ after infection.

RNA extraction,reverse transcription,and quantitative real-timePCR.Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen),and reverse transcription was performed using the one step first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Transgen).Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR） was performed using $2 \times$ SYBR Green PCR master mix(Transgen) in an Agilent $\mathrm { M x } 3 0 0 5 \mathrm { P }$ qRT-PCR system. The melting temperature profiles of the final products were used to ensure amplicon specificity.The relative fold-change in the expression of each mRNA was calculated using the ddCt method relative to the expression of Gapdh.The qRTPCR primers used are listed as follows:

# Results FOXO3ainteractswithHDAC1 and HDAC2

To identify the proteins that interact with FOXO3a in response to oxidative stress, weperformedaTAPassay.We found that some proteins associated with histone modification， including HDAC1and HDAC2, interact with FOXO3a (Fig. 1A). Then,we performed a co-IP assay to confirm the interactions between HDAC1/2 and FOXO3a.Under ectopic expression conditions in 293T cells,both HDAC1 and HDAC2 formed a complex with FOXO3a (Fig.1B). To determine the region of FOXO3a that is responsible for its association with HDAC1/2, the FOXO3a sequence was divided into five parts without overlapping as described previously (Lehtinen et al.,2006),and these fragments were subjected toa GST pull-down assay (Fig.1C).We found that GSTFOXO3a P5 was the primary region responsible for the association between FOXO3a and HDAC1/2.

Based on the TAP assay,we found that the number of peptide hits ofHDACl and HDAC2wasdramaticallydecreasedafter $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ treatment (Fig.lA).To confirm this result,we conducted co-IP experiments. The binding between HDAC1/2 and FOXO3a was also reduced in 293T cells following exposure to $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ (Fig. $1 D$ ,indicating that oxidative stress disrupts the interaction between the FOXO3a and HDAC1/2 proteins in cells.We also detected an interaction between endogenous HDAC1/2 and FOXO3a in CGN cells (Fig. 1E). Together, these data suggest that FOXO3a interacts with HDAC1 and HDAC2 and that these interactions are affected by oxidative stress.

# HDAC2knockdown inhibits ${ \bf H } _ { 2 } { \bf O } _ { 2 }$ -inducedneuronaldeath

FOXO3a is known to mediate neuronal death (Lehtinen et al., 2006),and FOXO3a binding partners may participate in neuronal apoptosis.To determine whether HDAC1 and HDAC2 are involved in regulating $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -induced neuronal death,we performed an apoptosis assay using CGNs.Although HDAC1 and HDAC2 are conserved proteins that display high sequence and functional similarities,we found that HDAC1 knockdown did not affect neuronal apoptosis, whereas HDAC2 knockdown significantly protected neurons from $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 A,B). These results indicated that HDAC2 plays an important role in $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -induced neuronal apoptosis.Furthermore,we found that the protective effect of HDAC2 knockdown in $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ induced CGN apoptosis was completely reversed by the overexpression of the rescue form of HDAC2,which is completely resistant to HDAC2 RNAi (Fig. $2 C , D$ ).To further evaluate whether HDAC1 and HDAC2 are functionally replaceable,we ectopically expressed HDAC1 in CGNs with HDAC2 knocked down (Fig.2E) and found that the expression of HDAC1 did not reverse the protective effect ofHDAC2 knockdown.These results indicate that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are not redundant with respect to the regulation of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.

Consistent with our previous findings (Xie et al.，2012),FOXO3a knockdown significantly attenuated $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -induced neuronal apoptosis.Interestingly,knockdown of both FOXO3a andHDAC2 did not result in an additional protective benefit against $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ compared withknockdown of FOXO3a alone (Fig. 2F)．In contrast, FOXO3a knockdown partially ameliorated the protection provided by HDAC2 knockdown,suggesting that FOXO3a is important for the HDAC2-mediated regulation of CGN apoptosis.Together,these results suggest that HDAC2,but not HDAC1,regulates $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -induced CGN apoptosis via the FOXO3a protein.

The FOXO3a acetylation and artificial transcriptional activity levels are not affectedbyHDAC1orHDAC2 directly The finding that the interaction between HDAC2 and FOXO3a regulates CGN apoptosis led us to study the molecular mechanism underlying this HDAC1/2- FOXO3a interaction. Previous reports have shown that FOXO3a can be acetylated by HATs,such as p30O,CBP,and PCAF,which affects FOXO3a transcriptional activity (Brunet et al.,2oo4; van der Heide and Smidt,2005). Class I HDACs deacetylate both histones and nonhistone proteins,such as p53(Brandl etal.,2012). To determine whether HDAC1 and HDAC2 deacetylate FOXO3a directly, we performed an in vitro deacetylation assay. The acetylation sites of FOXO3a are conserved and predominantly located in P2 and P3,including the sites K24l and K244 (Fig.3A;Greer and Brunet,2005). The recombinant P2 and P3 fragments of FOXO3a were incubated in PCAF and Ac-CoA to add the acetyl group to the FOXO3a proteins. Then, purified HDACl or HDAC2 was added to the reaction mixture. SIRT1,a Class III HDAC,served as a positive control (Brunet et al.,2004).We found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 failed to deacetylate the FOXO3a proteins but that SIRT1 removed the acetyl group from FOXO3a P2 (Fig. 3B,C). We also measured the acetylation level of FOXO3a in cells.In agreement with the in vitro results,the FOXO3a acetylation level was not decreased due to coexpression with HDAC2.There is a modest increase of FOXO3a acetylation might be due to unknown indirect effect of HDAC1 overexpression.However，the data clearly showed that not like SIRT1,HDACl,and HDAC2 could not deacetylate FOXO3a

protein in cells.Together,these data suggest that neither HDAC1 nor HDAC2 deacetylates the FOXO3a protein.

Furthermore,an artificial FOXO luciferase reporter assay revealed that ectopically expressed HDAC1/2 did not affect FOXO-mediated luciferase reporter activity inHT-22 cells,which are derived from mouse hippocampal cells (Fig. 3E). Similarly,knockdown ofHDAC1 or HDAC2 did notalter FOXO3a overexpression-induced luciferase activity in HT-22 cells (Fig.3F,G).Together,these results indicate that HDAC1/2 doesnot directly deacetylateFOXO3a oralter its transcriptional activity.

# HDAC2 is recruited to the p21 promoter by FOXO3a and regulates p21 expression

To elucidate the mechanism of HDAC2 knockdown-mediated neuroprotection, we measured the mRNAlevels of several putative FOXO3a target genes in HT-22 cells in which HDAC1 or HDAC2 was stably knocked down (Greer and Brunet, 20o5).We found that the mRNA levels of several genes associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle were significantly increased (Fig. 4A).Because we found that HDAC1/2 did not directly affect the transactivation of FOXO3a, we hypothesized that FOXO3a might act as a recruiter ofHDAC2 to the specific gene promoter region, inducing a change in histone acetylation (Karadedou et al.,20l2; Keniry et al.,2013). First, we performed a ChIP assay using an anti-HDAC2 antibody to examine the abundance of HDAC2 in the promoter region of p21,an important target of FOXO3a (Seoane et al., 2004).When FOXO3a is knocked down,the enrichment of HDAC2 is decreased on $\boldsymbol { p } \boldsymbol { 2 } \boldsymbol { l }$ Forkhead response element (FHRE)(Fig.4B). Histone 4 lysine l6 (H4K16) is a site that is regulated by HDAC2 (Miller etal.,2010).The H4K16 acetylation level of the p21 FHRE was increased due to HDAC2 or FOXO3a knockdown (Fig. 4C). In agreement with our finding that oxidative stress inhibits the interaction between FOXO3a and HDAC1/2 (Fig. $1 D$ )，wealso detected a decrease in HDAC2 binding to the $p 2 l$ promoter following $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ treatment (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the interactions between HDAC2 and the FHREs of Bcl6,Bim,and $p 2 7$ were not affected by $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ treatment.In agreement with this result,oxidative stress enhanced the $p 2 l$ FHRE acetylation levelbut not that of other FHREs (Fig.4E).Among the putative FOXO3a targets, only HDAC2-mediated $_ { p 2 l }$ expression was affected by $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ treatment and the regulation is dependent on FOXO3a,arguing that FOXO3a dynamically recruits HDAC2 to $\ d _ { p 2 l }$ promoter and regulates its expression in response to oxidative stress.The other targets including Bcl6,Bim,and $p 2 7$ were increased upon HDAC2 knockdown, indicating there might be other regulatory pathway thatis HDAC2 dependent,but FOXO3a independent in the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Next we performed an in vitro DNA pull-down assay (Fig. $4 F , G )$ .The interaction between HDAC2 and the $_ { p 2 l }$ FHRE was promoted by FOXO3a, whereas $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ treatment attenuated this binding (Fig.4G).To determine whether p21 contributes to the protective effect of HDAC2 deficiency, we knocked down HDAC2 in $p 2 l ^ { - / - } \mathrm { C G N } s \left( \mathrm { F i g } . 4 H \right)$ .The protective effect of HDAC2 knockdown was partially attenuated in $\overset { - } { p } 2 \overset { \_ } { I } { } ^ { - / - }$ CGNs compared with the wild-type control. These results suggest that $p 2 l$ plays a role in HDAC2 knockdown-induced neuroprotection,and they demonstrate that HDAC2 and p21 play an important role in the FOXO3a-dependent regulation of $\mathrm { \ddot { H } } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ -induced neuronal death.

HDAC2 knockdown induces p21 upregulation in a p53- independent manner,and HDAC2 knockdown-mediated neuronal protection occurs independently of p53 and E2Fl p53 is a known p2l regulator that participates in oxidative stressinduced apoptosis.Therefore,we investigated whether HDAC2 knockdown-induced protection is p53-dependent. We found that the Class IHDAC inhibitor Ms-275 promoted p21 expression atboth the mRNAand proteinlevels in HT-22 cells with p53 knocked down (Fig.5A,B).HDAC2 knockdown significantly protected CGNs after p53 knockdown (Fig.5C).

A previous study revealedaHDAC-E2F1-Bimaxis that affects apoptosis (Zhao et al.,20o5).We performed the apoptosis assay using p53/E2F1 double-knock-out CGNs and obtained similar results to those using wide-type (WT) CGNs (Fig. $5 D$ ).Wefound that Class I HDACs upregulate p21 expression in a p53- independent manner and that HDAC2 knockdown protects CGNs from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via a mechanism that occurs independently of p53 and E2F1.

# HDAC2 phosphorylation at S394 is important for the HDAC2-FOXO3a interaction

HDAC2 phosphorylation at S394 has been shown to affect the binding affinity of HDAC2 to the transcription factor Klf5 (Zheng et al.,2Ol1).We investigated the hypothesis that the HDAC2-FOXO3a interaction is affected by oxidative stressmediated dephosphorylation ofHDAC2 at S394. Oxidative stress diminished the phosphorylation level of HDAC2 at S394 in HT-22 cells and in mice (Fig. 6A-C).A co-IP assay revealed that the interaction between FOXO3a and HDAC2 is weakened in the brain following ischemia/reperfusion (Fig. 6D).

Next,we examined whether the HDAC2-FOXO3a interaction is associated with the phosphorylation of HDAC2 at S394. HDAC2 S394A mutation (mimicking the nonphosphorylated state）abolished the HDAC2-FOXO3a interaction，whereas HDAC2 S394D mutation (mimicking the consistent phosphorylation) increased the interaction (Fig.6E).In accordance with the co-IP result, the p21 FHRE displayed a tendency to bind to WT HDAC2 or HDAC2 S394D mutation,whereas its binding affinity to the S394A mutant was reduced (Fig. 6F).Because HDAC2 S394D showed a stronger interaction with FOXO3a,we next tested whether expression of $_ { p 2 l }$ is repressed by overexpression of HDAC2 S394D (Fig. 6G). The mRNA level of $p 2 l$ was decreased when HDAC2 S394D was overexpressed.Interestingly, the Bim mRNA level is not altered,indicating the HDAC2- mediated inhibition is specific to $p 2 l$ . In agreement with these results,the CGNs ectopically expressed HDAC2 S394D were sensitive to oxidative stress (Fig. 6H).

S394 of HDAC2 has been reported to be primarily phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2; Adenuga and Rahman,2010; Eom et al.,2011).In HT-22 cells,treatment with the CK2 inhibitor TBCA significantly disrupted the HDAC2-FOXO3a interaction (Fig.6I).This result indicated that HDAC2-FOXO3a depends on CK2-mediated phosphorylation.In accordance with this result,HDAC2 dissociated from the p21 FHRE following TBCA treatment (Fig.6J),and the H4Kl6ac level of the p21 FHRE was increased (Fig.6K).Therefore,theHDAC2-FOXO3a interaction is dependent on CK2-mediated phosphorylation of HDAC2 at S394,which is affected by oxidative stress (Fig. 6L).

# Discussion

In this study,we demonstrated that the HDAC2-FOXO3a complex responds to oxidative stress and mediates neuronal apoptosis via epigenetic modification.FOXO3a recruits HDAC2 to the $p 2 l$ promoter and deacetylates neighboring histones,reducing p21 expression (Fig.7,top). Oxidative stress abolishes the interaction between HDAC2 and FOXO3a, thus increasing the histone acetylation level of the $_ { p 2 l }$ promoter and upregulating p21 mRNA expression, but not the other putative FOXO3a targets. Similarly,HDAC inhibition led to histone hyperacetylation at the $p 2 l$ promoter and increased p2l expression (Fig.7,bottom). Furthermore,we elucidated that the S394 phosphorylation of HDAC2 is important for the FOXO3a-HDAC2 interaction and regulation of p2l expression (Fig.6L).Together,we identified HDAC2-p2l pathway that is important for oxidative stressinduced neuronal death.

The mechanism by which p21 protects cells from apoptosis has been elucidated.For example,p21 binds to apoptosis signalregulating kinase-l and caspase-3 in the cytoplasm,thereby protecting neurons from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Langley et al., 2008).Alternatively,p21 acts as a cell cycle repressor,potentially preventing cell-cycle re-entry and protecting neurons from apoptosis (Klein and Ackerman, 2003; Herrup et al.,2004; Kruman et al., 2004).

Recent reports suggest that HDACs are potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases,including AD and stroke.For example,in ischemic stroke,HDAC inhibition decreased the infarct volume and improved neurologic function in rodents (Langley et al., 2009; Kilgore et al., 2010). We propose an important mechanism underlying the neuroprotection provided by HDAC inhibition. (Biswas et al.,2005).

In the present study,we also found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 exhibit distinct effects on neuronal death.Several reports have shown that these two similar enzymes function differentially in neurological diseases.In AD patients,HDAC2,but notHDAC1 or HDAC3,is upregulated in the brain, thus mediating cognitive dysfunction(Gräff et al.,2012).HDAC2,but not HDAC1,has been demonstrated to negatively regulate synaptic plasticity and memory formation(Guan etal.,2oo9).Inaddition,HDAC1 knockdown causes DNA damage-related neuronal death,whereas

HDAC2 knockdown does not induce neuronal toxicity (Kim et al, 2008).These results,in combination with our findings, suggest that HDAC2,but perhaps not other HDACs,plays an important role in oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis and may be exploited as a therapeutic target forneurological diseases.

Interestingly,a recent study demonstrated that DAF-16, the FOXO3a homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans,employs the SWI/ SNF complex to manipulate chromatin remodeling, thereby regulating the expression of its target genes (Riedel et al.,2013). Based on our TAP results regarding FOXO3a,we identified a set of proteins that participates in histone modification, including EP300,a histone acetyltransferase (Ogryzko et al.,1996). These proteins may cooperatively regulate the acetylation balance of histones and epigenetically control gene expression by interacting with FOXO3a.We also found that phosphorylation of HDAC2 dynamically regulates theHDAC2-FOXO3a interaction.CK2,akinase responsible forHDAC2 phosphorylation,is considered as an important regulator of the HDAC2 and FOXO3a interaction.Interestingly, ithas been reported that CK2 is modulated by oxidative stress and its subunit is decreased in the ischemic brain (Kim etal.,2012). Our findings suggest that CK2-mediated HDAC2 phosphorylation affects the HDAC2-FOXO3 interaction,and CK2 inhibitors could potentially be used for neuroprotection.

In summary,our study elucidates the mechanism by which HDAC2 physically interacts with FOXO3a and differentially regulates the expression of FOXO3a target genes under oxidative stress conditions,thus mediating oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Fig.7).Therefore,HDAC2 may be a potential therapeutic target for neuronal apoptosis-related diseases,including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.
