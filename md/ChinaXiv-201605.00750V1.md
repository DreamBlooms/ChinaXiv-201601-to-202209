Abstract-Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POcD) is an important complication followingmajorsurgeryand general anesthesia in older patients.However, the etiology of POcD remains largely to be determined. It isunknown how surgical stress and psychological stress affect the postoperative learning and memory function in geriatric patients.We therefore establisheda pre-clinical model in aged C57BL/6 mice and aimed to investigate the effects of surgical stress and psychological stress on learning and memory function and the possible roles of the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR)pathway.The surgical stress was induced by abdominal surgery under local anesthesia,and the psychological stress was induced bya communication box. Cognitive functions and markers of the AKT/mTOR pathway were assessed at 1，3 and 7 days following the stress.The impairments of learning and memory function existed for up to 7 days following surgical stress and surgical stress plus psychological stress,whereas the psychological stress did not affect the cognitive function alone or combined with surgical stress.Analysis of brain tissue revealed a significant involvement of the AKT/mTOR pathway in the impairment of cognition. These data suggested that surgical stress could induce cognitive impairment in aged mice and perioperative psychological stress isnot a constitutive factor of POcD.The AKT/mTOR pathwayis likelyinvolvedasoneoftheunderlyingmechanisms of the development of POcD. $\circledcirc$ 2016 IBRO.Published by Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.

# INTRODUCTION

As extensive surgery in older patients becomes more common globally，postoperativecognitive dysfunction (POCD)is an important issue inperioperative care followingmajorsurgeries. Atpresent， POCDis described as a decline in cognitive function that occurs inpatients after surgery when compared to their preoperative cognitive status(Shoair et al., 2015).POCD afternon-cardiac surgery hasbeen associatedwith increasedmortality,decreased qualityof life,risk of early withdrawal from theworkforce，and increased dependency (Steinmetz et al.， 2009). The incidence of POCD among general or spinal anesthesia surgical patients (age $\geqslant 5 5$ yrs.）is about $1 3 . 6 \%$ at 3 months postoperatively (Silbert et al., 2014).The etiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms of POCD in elder patients after major non-cardiac surgery are still unclear.There is emerging evidence that the peripheral inflammatory cytokines generated during surgical stress will induce neuroinflammation aswell as inflammatory interactions between peripheral tissue and the central nervous system,which will harm the neurons and cause irreversible neuronal apoptosis (Liu et al.， 1997; Rosczyk et al., 2008).

Psychological stress is very common duringthe perioperative periods.Itwas reported to affect $6 0 \text{‰}$ of surgical patients (Norris and Baird， 1967; Shevde and Panagopoulos， 1991)，and the psychological stress before surgery could impair the wound repair process and disturb the regulation of biomarkers related to wound healing in the earlypostoperative period (Broadbent etal., 2003; Aberg et al.， 2007; Walburn et al., 2009). But the question ofwhether the vulnerabilities of POCD are associated with perioperative psychological stress remains unsolved.

The protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathwayisanintracellularsignaling pathway important in regulating neuronal development and physiology，which has been reported to have close relationshipswithneurologicandaging-associated diseases，such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (Rodgers and Theibert, 2002; Rickle et al., 2004). Studies have shown that the AKT/mTOR pathway might play a roleinneuroinflammation(Tyagietal.， 2010;

Tarassishin et al.， 2011； Zhao et al.， 2014). However, there are still knowledge gaps in how the AKT/mTOR pathways contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive decline during the development of POCD.

The aim of this study was to investigate how surgical stress andpsychologicalstresscouldaffect postoperative cognitive function and the expression of markers of the AKT/mTOR pathway in aged C57BL/6 mice.

# EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES

# Animal

A total of 204 C57BL/6 12-month-old health female mice (weighing $2 5 \substack { - 3 5 \mathfrak { g } } )$ ）were purchased from the company ofSiBeiFuExperimentalAnimalScience and Technology (Beijing，China).The animals were group housedincagesof $2 4 \times 2 4 \times 3 6$ cmatroom temperature $( 2 2 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C )$ and humidityof $5 0 \pm 1 0 \%$ under standard $1 2 - 1 2 - \mathsf { h }$ light-dark cycle． Food and waterwereavailableadlibitumexceptforthetimes of experiments.All the mice were acclimatized for2weeks before the implementation of the experimental protocol.

Female mice were used in this study due to the fact that females have been shown to perform better in certaincognitivetasks，particularlynovelobject recognition (NOR), than males in the animal study,and stage of the estrous cycle does not affect the result of learning tasks (Sutcliffe et al., 2007).

All the protocol in this study were set in accordance withthe National Institutes of Health“Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and were approved by the AnimalEthics Committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital (Beijing, China).

# Experimental design

Mice were numbered by weight and randomlyassigned to three study groups (Group S: Surgical stress，Group P: Psychological stress，Group X: Psychological stress plus surgical stress)，and each group was then divided into two subgroups, control and treatment (see Fig.1).

Surgical and psychological stress. In the surgical stress group， the mice of the treatment subgroup (Group ST， $n = 3 4 \mathrm { . }$ ）receiveabdominalexploration surgery under local bupivacaine anesthesia，which was establishedby $\mathsf { x } \mathsf { u }$ et al. (2014). In brief,after the mice was gently fixed to a heating pad $( 3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ ,the fur of the surgicalsitewasshavedand thencleanedwith iodophor disinfection solution,and a single injection of bupivacaine $( 0 . 5 \%$ ，1 ml) was administrated to the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal area.A midline incision of the abdomen about $2 { - } 2 . 5 \mathsf { c m }$ longwas performed prior toabdominal exploration for 5minusingasterilized cottonswabs.Afterward,the muscle and skin werestitched separately.The whole duration of the surgery was fixed at10-12min foreach mouse.Compound lidocaine cream 中 $2 5 \mathsf { m g }$ prilocaine and $2 5 \mathsf { m g }$ lidocaine，Beijing Ziguang Medication Manufacture Corporation Ltd.，China)was applied every $^ { 8 \mathfrak { h } }$ for the first and second post-operative days.No antibioticswereused.The mice in the control subgroup (Group SC, $n = 3 4$ ）received sham-surgery, onlyfixing，local anesthetized，and given analgesia in the same manner as the mice in group ST.

In the psychological stress group，a communication box as described by Ogawa and Kuwahara was used to produce psychological stress (Ogawa and Kuwahara, 1966).The important feature of this method is that an animal exposed to physical stress (i.e.foot shock）can induce psychological stress in another animal using an intraspecies emotional communication (lshikawa et al., 1992). This box $( 5 0 \times 3 0 \times 3 0 \mathrm { c m } )$ consists of a grid floor composed of stainless steel rods $( \varnothing = 0 . 5 { \mathsf { c m } }$ ）placed $1 . 0 \mathsf { c m }$ apart. The communication box was divided into 15 smaller chambers ( $1 0 \times 1 0 \times 3 0 \mathrm { c m } )$ with transparent plastic walls. In these 15 chambers,five of the chambers in the middle were connected to a Programmable DC Power Source meter (M8831, 30V/1A,Maynuo Electronics Co.，Ltd，Nanjing，China). Mice placed in this five chambers and received electric foot shock were defined as senders.The other mice placed in the other 10 chamberswithout electric connection were defined as responders.The responder mice were exposed to conditioned emotional stimuli such as visual,auditory，and olfactory sensations coming from the sender mice during the electric stimuli.In the treatment subgroup of the psychological stress group (Group PT, $n = 3 4$ )，sendermice received electric foot shock.In the control subgroup of the psychological stress group (Group PC, $n = 3 4$ ),sendermice did notreceive electric foot shock(sham-psychological stress).The programed electrical stimuli were established according to the previously reported method with minor modifications (Katsura et al.,2002). In brief, the electric stimuli were programed as follows.First，a current of 1 mA for 15s were applied to the mice for four times within each has a 15-s interval.Then,electric stimuli of 1.0, 1.5,2.0,2.3,2.7, and $3 . 0 \mathsf { m A }$ for $1 5 { \mathsf { s } }$ with $1 5 { \mathsf { s } }$ intervals were applied to animals under the same condition as the first step.The electric stimuli program was implemented three times in the morning between 9:00 am to 12:00 am and in the afternoon between 2:0o pm to $5 : 0 0 \mathsf { p m }$ for 15 consecutive days.Sterile water sprays were applied on the rods before placing the mice into the chamber to ensure an intact electric conduction.

In the combine stress (psychological stress plus surgical stress） group，the treatment subgroup (Group XT， $n = 3 4$ ）received15consecutivedaysof psychological stress followed by abdominal exploration surgerywithin $2 4 \mathsf { h }$ afterthe last electric stimuli. Whereas the control subgroup (Group XC， $n = 3 4$ ） received 15 consecutive days of sham-psychological stress followed by sham-surgery within $2 4 \mathsf { h }$ after the lastsham-electric stimuli.

Open field test. To determine whether the future behavioral changes were attributable to changesin spontaneous locomotor activity，anxiety，and adaptivity to the given task environment，open field tests were performed $2 h$ before the first NOR test.A number of 16 mice in each subgroup (96 mice in total) were randomly selected and subjected to behavior test in this study.

The open field test was performed as described in the previous study (Chaviaras et al.， 201O). The open field apparatus consists of a $5 0 \times 5 0 – \mathrm { c m }$ square floor surrounded by 30 cm high wall,which was divided into three concentric square shape zones representingthe close, medium,and far distance to the central of the field.The test was performed undera dark light of $5 0 \mathsf { I } \times$ .Micewere placed in the center of the open field and allowed to explore the area freely for 5 min.Their activities were recordedbyan overheadvideo camera.Themoving distance as well as the time staying in each zone of the open field was analyzed using animal behavior tracking system (Smart,San Diego Instruments,San Diego，CA，USA). The open field apparatus was thoroughly cleaned after the test of each mouse.

NOR task. The NOR task was used to evaluate cognition,especiallyrecognitionmemory.The NORtask protocol was performed according to a previous study with little modifications (Arnt et al.，201O). In brief, the micewerehabituatedtotheNORchamber $( 3 0 \times 3 0 \times 2 0 \mathsf { c m } )$ for 10 min before the start of testing. Then，two same identical objects were placed and fixed in the middle of the NOR chamber with a 10-cm interval. The mice were exposed to these two objects for 3 min. After that, the mice were returned to their home cage foran inter-trial interval of $1 5 \min$ ，theentire chamber wascleaned,bothobjects removedand one replaced with an identical familiar copy and one with a novel object. Following the interval,mice were returned to explore the familiar and novel objects in the NOR chamber for a 3-min retention trial.The chamberwas cleaned with a $70 \%$ ethanol spray and water between subjects.The object exploration is defined as mice sniffing，lickingor touching the objects with forepaws,and the exploration time of each object was recorded manually with two stop watches.The discrimination index (Dl)was calculated aftereachtrial $[ \mathsf { D } | =$ [the difference in exploration time between the novel and familiar objects]/[the total explo ration time ofboth objects in theretention triall).The NOR tests were performed at $2 4 \mathsf { h }$ and 7 days after the last treatment in each group.

Morriswater maze(MwM).MWM testingwas performed to assess spatial learning，spatial memory and cognitive flexibility (Morris et al.， 1982). The mice will be placed ina large circular pool (diameter $1 4 0 \mathsf { c m } ,$ filled with white non-toxic paint and water of $2 6 \pm 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ toa depth of $2 5 \mathsf { c m }$ .The circular pool was surrounded by external visual cues,and the maze was divided into four quadrants. In one quadrant (target quadrant),a transparent round platform of 9 cm of diameter was placed 0.5-1 cm below the horizontal surface.

The MWM training started $2 4 \mathsf { h }$ after the last treatment ineach group.All the mice were trained for seven consecutive days with three massed trials administered each day and the platform remained in the same location.Mice were placed on the platform for $3 0 { \mathsf s }$ ahead of the start of each training session.During the three trials,mice were randomly placed in the water in one of the three quadrants without the platform.Mice wereallowedto swim freely for $6 0 \thinspace \mathsf { s }$ oruntil the platform wasreached.Each trial stopped5 safter the mice stood onthe platform.If the mice did not find the platform within $6 0 \thinspace \mathsf { s }$ ，a guide stick was used to help the mice to find the platform.After completion of the trials the mice were towel dried and placed back to their home cage under a heat lamp for $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ .After 7 days of training, the hidden platformwas removed form the circular pool, and the mice were tested in the water maze for $6 0 \thinspace \mathsf { s }$ Time spend in the target quadrant was taken as measure for spatial memory.

Swimming speed， latency to the platform and swimming distance were monitored by a video camera fixed to the ceiling directly above the middle of circular pool,and the camera was used in conjunction with a computerized animal behavior tracking system (Smart, San Diego Instruments,San Diego,CA,USA).

# Tissue sampling

After 1day， 3 days and 7 days the animals were sacrificedbycervicaldecapitationunder deep sevoflurane anesthesia. Blood samples weretaken directly from theheart followingthoracotomy，and transcardialperfusionwasperformedwithice-cold standard phosphate-buffered saline.Then,the brain was immediately removed and washed in cold saline.The cortex and hippocampus were dissected and collected carefully in a sterile tube prior to being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.The blood samples were centrifuged for $1 0 \min$ at 26o0 rpm.The supernatants were collected and stored at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ until required for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.

# ELISA

Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \propto$ ） concentrations were determined using the mice TNF- $\cdot \mathsf { \alpha } _ { \mathsf { { A } } }$ ELISA-kit (Dakewe Bio-technology，Shenzhen，China) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

# Immunoblotting

Samples from the different groups were homogenized on iceusing RIPA buffer( $1 \%$ Triton $x - 1 0 0 / 1 \%$ sodium deoxycholate $1 0 . 1 \%$ $\mathsf { N a D o d S O } _ { 4 } / 1 5 / 1 5 0 \mathsf { m M } \mathsf { N a C } | / 1 0 \mathsf { m N }$ Tris·HCl， pH 7.2) plus protease inhibitors $( 1 \ \mu \mathfrak { g } / \mathfrak { m } \mathfrak { l }$ aprotinin, $1 \mu \ g / \ m \mu$ leupeptin, $1 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l }$ pepstatin A)．The lysates were collected，centrifuged at13,200 rpm for $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ，and then quantified for protein concentrations by aBCAproteinassaykit(Bio-RadLaboratories, Richmond，CA，USA)． Samples were separated on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamidegels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF,Whatman，England),which is then blocked with $5 \%$ non-fat milk. Afterward，the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight. The primary antibodies used in this study were anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technologies; $\# 9 2 7 2 )$ _ anti-p-AKT (Cell Signaling Technologies; $\# 4 0 6 0 )$ ，antimTOR(Cell Signaling Technologies； $\# 2 9 7 2 )$ ，anti-pmTOR(Cell Signaling Technologies; $\# 2 9 7 1$ ，anti- $\mathsf { P K C } \mathsf { a }$ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology，sc-8393) and anti- $\mathsf { \cdot p } \mathsf { - P K C } \mathsf { \cdot }$ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology， sc-12356)． Afterthree washeswith TBST buffer， themembraneswere incubated with goat anti-mouse-HRP and goat antirabbit-HRP for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ each.The images were digitized from the membrane and the band intensitywas quantified using image J analysis software (developed by the National Institutes of Health; available at: http:// rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

# Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0(SPSS Inc.， Chicago， IL， USA)． Data were expressed asmean $\pm$ standard deviation. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze the difference of escape latency between each group in the MWM test.Other results were subjected to a one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc LSD test was used to determine statistical differences between the experimentgroups. $p$ values less than O.05 were considered statistically significant.

# RESULTS

# Exploratory behavior

Although the total moving distance of mice in subgroup XT seems shorter than the other subgroups in the open field， there was no significant difference amongall subgroups $' { F } = 0 . 8 8 7$ ， $p = 0 . 4 9 3 )$ .Time spent in the far distance zone,which was perceived to be the safest for the mice，appeared to be longer for the subgroups that had psychological stress (Group PT an XT), although the difference between subgroups didnot reach statistical significance（ ${ ' } F = 2 . 0 9 7$ ， $p = 0 . 0 7 3$ (Fig. 2).

# Learning and memory

The learning and memory of the mice were evaluated using two methods,NOR task and MWM test.

In the first NOR task at $2 4 \mathsf { h }$ after the last experimental treatment, the explorationtime for thenovel objectwas significantly longer in each subgroup $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ . The DI did not have statistically significant differences between subgroups $( F = 1 . 3 8 0$ $p = 0 . 2 3 9 ;$ ，althoughonaverage the index seemed decreased in group ST and group XT.

In the second NOR task performed on the seventh day after the last experimental treatment， the mice that underwentabdominalexplorationsurgeryfailedto discriminate between a familiar and anovel object in the secondtesting session， while themiceinthe psychological stress group (group PT) and all the control groups (group SC，group PC and group XC) clearly directed exploration toward the novel object.Similar results were obtained when results were expressed as Dl in Fig. 3.

Although group ST and group XT had less time spent in the target quadrant compared to the other groups，the ANOVA did not reveal a significant effect of groups （ $( F = 2 . 0 9 7$ ， $p = 0 . 0 7 3$ (Fig. 4).

# Plasma TNF- $\pmb { \alpha }$

Plasma TNF- $\cdot \mathsf { \alpha } _ { \mathsf { X } }$ increased significantly at day 1 after the lastexperimental treatment in group ST $( p = 0 . 0 3 5 )$ and group XT $( p = 0 . 0 1 3 )$ ，when compared to its own control.At day 3,there was no significant difference in either group ST compared to group SC $( p = 0 . 0 5 5 )$ or group XT compared to group XC $( p = 0 . 1 4 5 )$ ，although therewasa trend of higher plasma TNF- $\cdot \mathsf { \alpha } _ { \mathsf { X } }$ level in the treatmentsubgroupswhichunderwentsurgical procedures.At day 7，no statistical difference in plasma TNF- $\cdot \mathsf { \alpha } _ { \mathsf { X } }$ level was found between each subgroup (Fig. 5).

# Expression of phosphorylated-AKT

Ourexperiment foundthattheexpressionof phosphorylated-AKT protein level in the hippocampus was remarkably suppressed and the AKT expression was unchanged in the groups that underwent abdominal surgery (Group ST and group XT) at both day 1 and day 3.However,in the cortex,the phosphorylated-AKT expression was elevated at day1and then significantly suppressed at day 3 in group ST and group XT (Fig. 6).

# Expression of phosphorylated-mTOR

The phosphorylated-mTOR in the hippocampus was slightly decreased in group ST and group XT at day 3 compared with that of their own control groups.Similar results were also found in the cortex:the phosphorylatedmTOR level in both group ST and group XT was significantlyreduced at day 3. At day7， the phosphorylated-mTOR level in the cortex was still lower than group XC,whereas no difference was found in the hippocampus (Fig.7).

# DISCUSSION

Despite a rapid growing awareness of the importance of POCD as a major complication in aged patients after anesthesia and surgery,specific reasons for this kind of cognitive impairment remain unclear.Many studies aimed to determine the pathogenesis of POCD in surgical patients. However， evidenceshowednosignificant difference in the incidence of POCD between general anesthesia，abdominal surgery or general anesthesia plus abdominal surgery,and no study had ever reported the effect of psychological or psychological stress followed by surgical stress on cognitive function.We therefore established a pre-clinical model in aged C57BL/6 mice and aimed to explore the surgical stress andpsychological stress on learning and memory function and the possible roles of the AKT/mTOR pathway.We found that peripheral abdominal surgical stress caused suppression of phosphorylated-AKT level, suppression of phosphorylated-mTOR level，increased levels of phosphorylated-PKC $\mathfrak { a }$ in the brain，and increased TNF- $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { a } }$ in the plasma.Cognitive impairment in aged mice was caused by abdominal surgical stress but not psychological stress.Psychological stress alone did not impair cognitive function in aged mice,but could alter thelevel ofphosphorylated-PKC $\mathfrak { a }$ in the hippocampus and the cortex.The cognitive impairment of the aged miceseems not be deteriorated after the combination of surgical and psychological stress.

In the present study，we found that shortly after the peripheral abdominal surgery with local anesthesia,the mice started to develop cognitive dysfunction with impaired learning and memory ability in the MWM and

NOR task.The impairment of cognition lasted for at least 7 days after the surgery. The mice with surgical procedures had an average escape latency and Dl of $90 \%$ longerand $40 \%$ lower，respectively，when compared to the control and psychological stress mice. The effect of surgical stress on cognition function is in accordance with the result of the studies from $\mathsf { x } \mathsf { u }$ et al. (2014).They demonstrated that peripheral surgery was ableto inducecognitive impairment independent of general anesthesia in 18-month-old mice,and the impairment of cognitionwas causedbythe brain $\mathsf { A } \beta$ accumulation.In another study，Hovens et al. found that hippocampal dependent learning and memory were vulnerable to impairmentasaconsequenceofabdominalsurgery-induced neuroinflammation,and the changes in exploratory behavior were correlated to plasma IL-6 concentrations at $2 4 \mathsf { h }$ after surgery (Hovens et al., 2014)． Moreover， Rosczyk et al． and Fidalgo et al. reportedthatperipheralsurgerycoulddisrupt hippocampal-dependent learning and memory due to the increase of $\vert L - 1 \\beta$ level in the brain of aged animals (Rosczyk et al.， 2008； Fidalgo et al.， 2011). Thus，we can infer that the impairment of cognitive function in aged miceafter peripheral surgery may be due to a series of complex biochemical changes in the brain，which are related to both neuroinflammation and neuron apoptosis.

However,in those mice receiving psychological stress from the communication box，no signs of cognitive impairment were identified using the MWM and NOR task.Only a slight increase，not statistically significant, in the preference for the far distance zone in the open field test was observed in the psychological stress model mice.The psychological stress model, induced by the communication box,did not alter the cognitive status of surgical stress mice.Our study is the first to test the learning and memory function instead of corticosterone levels in rodents following psychological stress induced bya communication box (lshikawa et al.，1992； Endo et al.，2001)． The possible explanation for this phenomenon is that (l) although aged mice are more sensitive to both the cognitive and inflammatory effects of mild stress than are adult mice (Buchanan et al.， 2oo8)，the intensity of psychological stress in this study may not reachthe thresholdof alteringcognitive functioninaged mice (Lupien and McEwen，1997); (Il) female mice have aquickerabilitytorecoverfromcognitive impairmentafter chronic stress (Conrad et al., 2003).

To investigate the potential mechanisms of how surgical and psychological stress affect the learning and memory，expressed as the results of MWM and NOR task，wefocused ourbiochemical analyseson the AKT/mTOR pathway inthe hippocampus andthe cortex. We chose to analyze the protein expression in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex because they governcognitiveandbehavioralfunctioninthe mammalian brain (Atallah et al.，20o4).Many recent reports observed that the change of protein expression in the brain led to change in cognitive and behavioral function (Rosczyk et al.， 2008; Wan et al.， 2010; Xu et al., 2014).In our study，various degrees of decreases in phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in the hippocampus were observed at day 1 and day 3 in both of the groups undergoingabdominal surgery.These results agree with the previous experimental study performed by Gong etal.， whichsuggestedthatdown-regulationof phosphorylated-AKT may contribute to the impairments of learning and memory functions in stroked mice (Gong et al.，2012).While in the cortex，we observeda short-termelevationofphosphorylated-AKTafter abdominal surgery，which may be explained by the loss of temporal regulation oraberrant control of AKT in the neurons (Griffin et al., 2005).

Thesuppressionoftheexpressionofboth phosphorylated-AKT and phosphorylated-mTOR in the hippocampus is concomitant with a cognitive decline in miceunderwent abdominal surgery， measuredby behavior tests.The consistency between the behavior andbiochemicalanalysisdemonstratedthatthe impairment of cognitive function of aged mice after abdominalsurgery，intheabsenceofgeneral anesthetics， isrelatedtothe suppression ofthe AKT/mTOR pathway.Asreportedpreviously， the activation of AKT through the phosphorylation of several effectors in the hippocampus following the stimulating of injury factors is mainly considered in the context of limiting apoptosis of the neurons (Wang et al.，2014), and the mTOR,which is the downstream substrate of PKB/AKT signaling，was also reported to regulate many majorcellularprocessandpathologicalconditions includingneurodegeneration (neuronal apoptosis) (Laplante and Sabatini， 2012). Regulated AKT/mTOR signaling is critical for synapticplasticitymechanisms， andthe inhibition of AKT/mTOR in neurons might impair synaptic protein synthesis needed for normal learning and memory (Graber et al.，2013).Therefore，from a neuron-centric view，the continuous suppression of the AKT/mTOR pathway at day 1 and day 3 after abdominal surgery mightbe expectedto havea certain extent of neuron dysfunction,apoptosis and even death,which led to the cognitive impairment observed by NOR test at day 7.

We identified several weaknesses in our study. First, all the mice were observed and tested only for 7 days aftersurgery;thelong-termeffect ofperipheral abdominalsurgeryoncognitivefunctionremains unknown． Second，no method of rescuing cognitive impairments(i.e.usingcorrespondingdrugsor antibodies to reduce the neuron apoptosis）was tested in this study.Third,only female mice were used in this experimental study.Finally,animal models used in this study cannot completely reproduce the clinical situation of POCD and its complexity.

# CONCLUSION

The results of this study indicate that surgical stress (under local anesthesia)played an important role in postoperative cognitive impairments in aged mice and that the AKT/mTOR pathway is likely a part of the underlyingmechanismsofthisprocess. The psychological stress，generated by the communication box，isnot a constitutive factor ofpost-operative cognitiveimpairment followingabdominalsurgeryin aged mice.Furtherstudiesareneeded to comprehensivelyexamine theunderlyingmechanisms of neuronal apoptosis followed by surgical stress and the potential therapeutic methods of rescuing the cell death and cognitive impairment.
