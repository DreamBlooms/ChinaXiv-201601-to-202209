Abstract Dianmeisaurus gracilis is restudied on the basis of a new specimen.It provides some new information,especially that on the skull roof,to the species.The most striking of those new characters include the snout (preorbital region） shorter than the orbit,the interorbital septum extremely narrow,the frontal with a sharp process at both ends,and the posterior margin of the skull roof deeply V-shaped.A phylogenetic analysis with new information confirms that Dianmeisaurus is the sister group of Diandongosaurus and that these two genera, together with those Chinese taxa (Majiashanosaurus,Dianopachysaurus, Keichousaurus,and Dawazisaurus), form a monophyletic clade which is more closely related to the Nothosauroidea than to a clade formed by the European pachypleurosaurs.

# 1 Introduction

Dianmeisaurus gracilis is a small-sized eosauropterygian (Shang and Li,2O15). The holotype of the taxon was collected from Member I (Anisian) of the Guanling Formation in Luoping County of Yunnan Province, China. The previous work suggested that Dianmeisaurus was closely related to Diandongosaurus from the same stratum of Luoping (Shang and Li,2015). Together with Dianopachysaurus dingi (Liu et al., 2011),Diandongosaurus acutidentatus (Shang et al.,2011),and Dawazisaurus brevis (Cheng et al.,2016), four smal-sized eosauropterygians have been reported so far from Member I of the Guanling Formation in Luoping.

Unfortunately, the holotype of Dianmeisaurus lacks information on the dorsal side of the skeleton owing to only the ventral side of the skeleton visible.Here we report a new specimen of Dianmeisaurus gracilis from its type locality, which is nearly complete and preserved in dorsal view.Thus additional osteological features from the dorsal side of the skeleton can be observed. With new information, the new specimen enriches our knowledge of Dianmeisaurus,helps to clarify its phylogeny based on the holotype,and tests the existing hypotheses on phylogenetic relationships among the European pachypleurosaurs (including the Neusticosaurus, Serpianosaurus,Dactylosaurus and Anarosaurus), Nothosauroidea, and the Chinese pachypleurosaur-like forms (sensu Cheng et al., 2016).

# 2 Description

The new specimen (IVPP V 17054) is fully articulated and preserved in dorsal view (Fig. 1). It isnearly complete,with alength of $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ，and slightly smaller than the holotype,which has total length of $3 1 5 \mathrm { m m }$

The following description on the dorsal side of the species is based on the new specimen. We also give some description on the ventral side of the species based on the holotype to compare.

Skull The length of the skull (from the tip of the snout to the occipital condyle) is 18.5 mm in the new specimen (Fig.2),slightly shorter than that of the holotype ( $2 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ).The snout (preorbital region) is very short and even shorter than the orbit in length,which is comparable to the condition of Keichousaurus hui among known eosauropterygians (Holmes et al., 2008). It is round anteriorly and lacks rostral constriction.

The oval-shaped external naris is very small and sitting anteriorly, closer to the snout end than to the orbit, which is in contrast to that seen in Dianopachysaurus dingi (Liu et al.,2011) and Dawazisaurus brevis (Cheng et al., 2016) where the opposite is true.

The orbit is large, slightly longer than wide. Its longitudinal length is slightly less than twice length of the supratemporal fenestra. The supratemporal fenestra is elongated elliptic in outline as in Dianopachysaurus and Dawazisaurus but differs from the oval-shaped of Diandongosaurus (Shang et al.,2011). The infratemporal fenestra is large and opens ventrally as in the aforementioned taxa. The oval pineal foramen is positioned anteriorly, setting at a level about the anterior margin of the supratemporal fenestra.

As in Dianopachysaurus and Dawazisaurus,the preorbital region is shorter than the postorbital portion (to the posterolateral end of the squamosal). Dianmeisaurus differs from them in that the interorbital septum is extremely narrow,less than 1/3 of the interfenestral region of skull table in width. The occipital edge of the skull roof is deeply concave as in Dawazisaurus.

The large,paired premaxillae form most of the snout. It embraces the external naris and shapes the anterior and lateral margin of the external naris. Its maxillary process extends posteriorly and contacts the maxilla posteriorly and the nasal posteromedially at the level behind the posterior margin of the external naris.Its nasal process is elongate and extends further posteriorly between the nasals to a level far behind the posterior margin of the external naris.The palatal portion of the premaxilla is largely covered by the mandible in the holotype, but it is clear that the bone meets its counterpart along the ventral midline and forms the entire anterior margin of the internal choana.Posteriorly, the premaxilla contacts the maxilla laterally and the vomer medially. This situation is same as the European pachypleurosaurs and Keichousaurus (Sander,1989; Carroll and Gaskill,1985; Holmes et al.,2008),but differs from the Diandongosaurus (Sato et al.,2014) and Nothosaurus (Rieppel,2000: figs. 55B,58B,59B,

60B)in which the premaxillais excluded from the internal naris.

The nasals meet each other posteriorly along the midline.Anteriorly, they have a slender premaxillary process,which extends anteriorly into the external naris and further lines the medial margin of the naris against the nasal process of the premaxilla.In other words, the premaxillary process of the nasal and the nasal process of the premaxilla together form the internarial septum.Posteriorly, the nasals taper off and end between the anterior processes of the frontals at a level shortly behind the anterior margin of the orbit.Laterally,the nasal forms the posterior margin of the external naris and meets the maxillary process of the premaxilla, which excludes the maxilla from the naris.

The dorsal exposure of the prefrontal is broad. Its anterior process inserts between the nasal and maxilla, approaching the sutural joint of the premaxilla, nasal and maxilla. Sutures with the nasal and maxilla are zig-zagged and the prefrontal-frontal suture is deeply interdigitated.

The paired frontals form the dorsal margins of the orbits.The interorbital septum is extremely narrow in the new specimen as shown in the holotype where a wide split along the ventral midline exposed the ventral surface of the frontals (see Shang and Li, 2015: fig. 2). The anterior end of the frontal tapers into a sharp process,which embraces, together with its counterpart from the other side,the nasals anteriorly,and laterally, the sharp process is forked to receive the prefrontal. Posteriorly, the frontal also tapers into a sharp process to embrace,together with its counterpart of the other side,the parietal and approaches the supratemporal fossa posteriorly as in many other Chinese pachypleurosaur-like forms such as Dianopachysaurus (Liu et al., 2011), Diandongosaurus (Shang et al.,2011),and Dawazisaurus (Cheng et al.,2016). The frontal-postfrontal suture is slightly convex laterally, while the frontal-parietal suture is deeply interdigitated.

As in Dianopachysaurus, Dawazisaurus and Diandongosaurus, the postfrontal broadly lines the posteromedial margin of the orbit anterolaterally and enters anteromedial margin of the supratemporal fenestra posterolaterally. Sutures with the parietal and postorbital are interdigitated.

The maxilla does not take part in the formation of the ventral margin of external naris. It meets the premaxilla at a level behind the posterior margin of the external naris.The ascending process of the maxilla is not well-developed. Posteriorly, the maxilla forms the entire ventral margin of the orbit and overlapped by the jugal at the level of the posteroventral corner of the orbit.

The jugal is a small, lunate-like bone. It forms the posteroventral margin of the orbit, ending anteriorly at a level just posterior to the midpoint of the ventral orbital margin. Posteriorly, the jugal forms the anterior margin of the infratemporal fenestra but is excluded from the upper temporal arch.

The postorbital is a triradiate element.Anteriorly, it defines the posterior border of the orbit.Its anteromedial ramus forms most of the orbital-supratemporal septum. Its posterior ramus extends caudally to a level slightly anterior to the midpoint of the supratemporal arch.

[ts suture with the jugal is lineal while its suture with the squamosal is deeply interdigitated.

The parietals are fully fused in new specimen, but their anterior portions anterior to the parietal foreman are sutured in ventral view in the larger holotype,which may indicate a variation in Dianmeisaurus.The parietal is extremely broad and flat between the supratemporal fenestrae and lacks a constriction at the posterior-most portion, which is seen in Dianopachysaurus,Dawazisaurus and Keichousaurus. Starting from the parietal foreman, the parietal narrows as a process inserting between the posterolateral processes of the frontals.The parietal broadens posterolaterally and meets the squamosal in an oblique but lineal suture,and posteriorly, its occipital margin is very concave as in Dawazisaurus.

The squamosal is a large and stout element. Anteriorly, it forms the posterior half of the supratemporal arch and medially, it forms, together with the parietal, the posteromedial margin of the supratemporal fenestra.The occipital portion of the squamosal is flange-like and meets the supraoccipital medially and the exoccipital-opisthotic complex ventrally. Laterally, the descending process of the squamosal extends downwards to the quadrate condyle.

The presence of the quadratojugal is uncertain

The quadrate is of limited exposure.Its posterior surface is concave.The lateral portion of the condyle appears slightly larger than the medial portion.

The occiput is closed and plate-like, typical to eosauropterygians (Rieppel, 2000). No distinct occipital crest present.The surface of the supraoccipital is flat, without a medial ridge. No sutures between the braincase bones are clearly recognized owing to poor preservation on the new specimen. Both the holotype and new specimen show the occipital condyle locating at the same level as the mandibular condyles of the quadrate.

The paired vomers are elongated and bar-like. They form the medial margins of the internal choanae anterolaterally and contact the palatines posterolaterally.They extend posteriorly and suture with the pterygoids at a level nearly below the anterior margins of the orbits.

The palatine is a broad plate and extends substantially parallel to the direction of the dentary. Its anterior part forms the posterior margin of the internal choana.Though there are some cracks, its suture with the pterygoid is clear, being lineal and oblique in direction.

The ectopterygoid lies posterior to the palatine and point to the infratemporal fenestra. It meets the anterolateral side of the transverse process of the pterygoid medially. The ectopterygoid is also present in Diandongosaurus (Sato et al.,2014),but not in other Chinese pachypleurosaur-like forms such as Dianopachysaurus (Liu et al.,2011), Dawazisaurus (Cheng et al.,2016) and Keichousaurus (Holmes et al., 2008).

The pterygoids form most of the palate.Anteriorly, more than three-quarters of the pterygoids are widely spaced along the midline,but the posterior quarter meets on the midline with unclear suture (Shang and Li, 2O15: fig. 2). The anteriorly narrow end of the pterygoid meets the vomer. The quadrate ramus extends posterolaterally,and broadly contacts the pterygoid ramus of the quadrate at the position lateral to the occipital region.

Two hyobranchia are preserved on the ventral surface of the pterygoids.They are thin, sticklike, with an anterior portion slightly thicker than the posterior portion as in those of some other eosauropterygians, such as the European pachypleurosaurs (Carrolland Gaskill, 1985; Sander, 1989),Keichousaurus (Holmes et al.,2oo8),and some nothosaurs (Li and Rieppel, 2004).

MandibleThe mandibular symphysis is short, comparable with that of Keichousaurus (Lin and Rieppel,1998; Holmes et al.,2008),and much shorter than Diandongosaurus (Sato etal.,2014).

The dentary extends posteriorly to a level exceeding the half way of the mandibular ramus.Posteroventrally, it overlaps the angular and tapers into a pointed end.Posterolaterally and posterodorsally, it meets the angular and surangular with interdigital sutures.

Only the anterior portion of the splenial is exposed in the holotype. It takes part in the forming of the mandibular symphysis as in Diandongosaurus (Sato et al.,2014).

The surangular forms the dorsal half of the posterior portion of the mandible and the dorsolateral edge of the retroarticular process. The angular is longer than the surangular and forms the posteroventral half of the mandible and the ventrolateral edge of the retroarticular process. Anteromedial to the angular, a triangular prominent projecting dorsally indicates the presence of the coronoid process.

The anterior portion of the articular is broad and forms most of the articular fossa. The latter is divided into two parts,matching the divisions of the quadrate condyle. The retroarticular process is well-developed, slightly longer than the length of the supratemporal fenestra.The dorsomedial surface of the retroarticular process is concave and its posterior end is truncated.

Dentition There are five premaxillary teeth,of which the anterior four are enlarged and fang-like, but not as large as the king-sized premaxillary teeth of the Diandongosaurus (Shang et al.,2011) and the fifth is possibly smaller as Nothosaurus (Rieppel,2000).

The third maxillary tooth is fang-like which is as large as the premaxillary teeth. The maxillary teeth anterior and posterior to this fang-like tooth are much smaller and of similar size.The maxillary tooth row extends posteriorly almost to the level of the posterior end of the orbit. It is difficult to know the exact number of the maxillary teeth due to the occlusion of the jaws.Based on the preserved teeth and their spaces in both the holotype and the new specimen the maxilla possibly bears 15 teeth.

It is evident that four fang-like teeth are present within the symphyseal region of the mandible.It is uncertain if the fifth dentary tooth is also fang-like.It is impossble to establish an exact tooth count behind the symphyseal fangs owing to the tight occlusion of the lower jaw with the upper jaw.

All the exposed teeth are sub-conical and curve medially and slightly posteriorly, with fine striations on the crown surface.

Axial skeletonThe last cervical or the first dorsal vertebra cannot be determined due to the poor preservation of ribs in the shoulder girdle region in the new specimen,although the count of 45 pre-caudal vertebrae is the same as in the holotype (Shang and Li,2O15). The presence of four vertebrae was inferred in the sacral region of the holotype, but the number of four sacral vertebrae can be confirmed in the new specimen. In this case, it is most likely that the new specimen also had 23 cervical,18 dorsal,and four sacral vertebrae as in the holotype. For the tail, 36 caudal vertebrae are preserved in the holotype (Shang and Li,2O15), while 41 caudals are preserved in the new specimen (Fig. 1). The zygapophyseal pachyostosis is not evident in the exposed sections of the vertebral column and allribs clearly lack such a swelling in both the holotype and the new specimen.

The atlas is represented by a small stumpy atlantal centrum and two relatively large irregular arched atlantal neural arches in the holotype.The small axial odontoid process is also well exposed in the holotype.It is multi-prism-shaped and shorter than the atlantal centrum.A very similar bone was illustrated for Neusticosaurus pussilus (Sander,1989: fig.14).

As the following cervical vertebrae, the axial centrum is cylinder-shaped and its ventral surface is concave.It is slightly shorter than that of cervical 3 in the holotype. The preserved post-zygapophyses of the axis are flat and broad.

In the holotype, the anterior cervical centra are slightly increases in length/width ratio, which is about 2.5 in the anterior cervical vertebrae (from the third to $1 1 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ ),but the ratio decreases dramatically from the $1 2 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ ，and it diminishes to 1.7 for the $2 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ cervical. The ventral surface of the centrum is smooth, without longitudinal keel and subcentral foramina.The new specimen shows that the cervical neural arch possibly bears a wide neural spine.

Axial rib is not preserved in both the holotype and the new specimen.

From the $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ to ${ 1 1 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ cervical vertebrae, the associated ribs are nearly constant in size and similar in shape.They developed a distinct anterior process close to the articular heads, which is longer than the shaft. From the $1 2 ^ { \mathrm { { t h } } }$ cervical, rib gradually increases in length but its anterior process gradually decreases in length. The anterior process entirely disappears from the $1 8 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ rib.The rib distal ends are tapered till the $2 3 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ ：

The size and shape of the dorsal vertebrae are not distinctly different from the cervicals in the pectoral region.

Most of the dorsal vertebrae are covered by the elements of the gastralia,and the exposed ones show a distinctly constricted centrum. The posterior dorsal vertebrae are slightly longer than the anterior ones in the holotype.

The shape of the dorsal neural arches of the new specimen is obscured because of the poor preservation, but it is clear that the postzygapophyses are broad and flat, the transverse processes are short, and the zygosphene-zygantrum articulation is present.

All18 pairs of the dorsal ribs are exposed in both the holotype and the new specimen (Fig. 3). The first dorsal rib of the holotype clearly shows a truncated distal end, with a shoulder section slightly wider than its distal end.In the middle part of the trunk,the ribs are of nearly constant size,whereas the last three (from the $1 6 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ to $1 { 8 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ ） dorsal ribs decrease in size again as they approach the sacrum.

Four sacral vertebrae identified in the new specimen.There is no significant difference between the sacral and dorsal vertebrae in outline.Among the four sacral ribs of the new specimen, the first and second are incomplete,whereas the third is as long as the fourth ( $5 \mathrm { m m }$ in length). The sacral ribs are bar-shaped and slightly expanded at their distal end.

A total of 36 caudal vertebrae are preserved in articulation in the holotype and 41 in the new specimen. The last of the preserved caudal vertebra is less than $2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in length in the holotype, which suggests that the missing tip of the tail may have only contained the last few caudals in the holotype.The last caudal vertebra of the complete tail of the new specimen is less than $1 \mathrm { m m }$

The caudal vertebrae gradually decrease in size caudally. The caudal centra are cylindrical and constricted medially. The neural spines are low and strongly oblique posteriorly.

The first five caudal vertebrae bear long and slender, laterally directed transverse processes, which are gradually shortened in length posteriorly and are followed by four caudals with very short and triangle-shaped transverse processes.

Each gastral set consists of five elements as in other eosauropterygians. The angle degree of the V-shape median elements increases caudally. The lateral elements bear a pointed distal end, which differs from the broadened end of the elements in Diandongosaurus (Sato et al.,2014).

Appendicular skeleton The pectoral girdle is fully exposed in the holotype (Fig. 4A). The narrow medial portion of the clavicle meets its counterpart to exclude the interclavicle from the anterior edge of the pectoral girdle; the wide lateral portion of the clavicle developed a sharply triangle-shaped anterior process at its anterolateral corner. This anterior process is placed at the same position as that in Diandongosaurus but it is much stouter and blunter distally. Such an anterior process was considered as a diagnostic character for Dianmeisaurus gracilis by Shang and Li (2015) and unequivocally present in the new specimen (Fig. 4B). The posterolateral process of the clavicle overlaps the anteromedial dorsal aspect of the scapula, showing a typical pattern of sauropterygians.

The interclavicle is rhomboidal and lacks a posterior process.

The scapula has a constriction separating a ventral glenoidal portion from a posteriorly directed dorsal wing. The scapula dorsal process is rod liked and tapers to a blunt tip,with a rod length as long as the glenoidal portion.

The coracoid shows a rounded proximal head and a strongly concave anterior margin opposing the less distinctly concave posterior margin. The coracoids of both sides meet ventrally in a well-defined suture.

Of the pelvic girdle, the ilium is not preserved in the holotype,but it is well exposed in dorsal view in the new specimen (Fig. 3B). It develops a short and tapering posterior process and the broadened ventral portion to contribute the formation of the acetabulum.

The two ischia and two pubes are preserved in articulation in the holotype (Shang and Li, 2015: fig. 3B). Their morphology conforms to the general pattern of nothosaurs (Romer,1956; Rieppel, 2000).

The pubis shows weakly concave anterior and posterior margins. The obturator foramen is not closed, with an open slit at their sutures with the ischia near the acetabular margin of the bones (see Shang and Li, 2015: fig. 3B).

The ischium shows a narrow acetabular portion, a weakly concave anterior margin, a strongly concave posterior margin,and a widely expanded medial portion with a convex medial margin (see Shang and Li, 2015: fig. 3B).

There are no notable differences in the limb morphology between the holotype and the new specimen (Figs. 5,6).The limbs are long and slender, with the forelimb slightly shorter than thehindlimb.

The humerus is shorter than the femur but relatively stouter than thelatter.It shows a concave medial (preaxial) margin,a broadly expanded distal portion, and a weakly sigmoidal appearance.The entepicondylar foramen is well setofffrom the distal articular facet and a distinct ectepicondylar groove is present.

The ulna is as long as the radius, but stouter than the later. The proximal head of the ulna is more expanded than the distal end. The proximal end of the radius is slightly wider than the distal end.

In the holotype,the carpus comprises three ossified rounded elements,i.e.,the intermedium,the ulnare,and the fourth distal carpal, in the right forelimb,but only two ossified carpal elements,i.e., the intermedium and the ulnare,are preserved in the left forelimb,with the fourth distal carpal missing in this forelimb.The fourth distal carpal is not observed on both left and right forelimbs in the new specimen.

The $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ metacarpal is much shorter and slightly broader than the others. The $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ metacarpal is as long as the $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ metacarpal in the holotype, but is the longest in the new specimen, which suggests an asymmetrical development of the two metacarpals given the fact of the size difference between the two specimens.

The phalangeal elements are completely preserved in digitals 1 to 3 and 5, but missing the ungual in the fourth digit in the right manus of the holotype.The complete fourth digit of the left manus in the new specimen bears five phalangeal elements.In this case, the phalangeal formula of the forelimb counts for 2-3-5-5-3 in D. gracilis.All preserved ungual phalanges in the forelimbs show no distinct expansion that is seen in Diandongosaurus (Shang et al., 2011).

The femur is slender and sigmoidal in outline (Fig. 6). The femoral shaft is straight and biconcave. The proximal head is expanded and slightly wider than the distal head.A very shallow intertrochanteric fossa appears present.

Of the two lower limb elements, the fibula and tibia are approximately of same length, and the tibia is wider than the fibula.The fibula is slender and strongly curved,which contracts with the rather straight tibia.

In both the holotype and new specimen, two tarsal elements are ossified,i.e., the rounded astragalus and calcaneum.The latter is smaller than the former and lies between the distal end of the fibula and metatarsal 5.

The $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ metatarsal is distinctly shorter and broader than all the others.Its proximal head is markedly expanded. The $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ metatarsal is the longest in the metatarsal series. The phalangeal elements are cylindrical, slightly constricted at the mid shaft,and get shorter in length towards the tip of the digits. The ungual elements are well-developed in the1st to $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ digits of the new specimen. They are markedly expanded as in Diandongosaurus (Shang et al., 2011), with a size distinctly larger than their preceding phalanges.

The phalangeal elements of the hindlimbs are completely preserved in the holotype, except for digit 4 where the ungual is missing.With the addition of the ungual to digit 4, the phalangeal formula of the hindlimb should have counted for 2-3-4-5-5 in $D$ gracilis.

# 3 Discussion

# 3.1 Evidences supporting the assignment of the new specimen to Dianmeisaurus gracilis

Although the holotype and new specimen are preserved in different views, the skulls of both specimens display a similar appearance.They are comparable in having moderately developed fang-like teeth in the premaxillary,maxilla,and the dentary,and a very anteriorly positioned naris. The distinctly narrow interorbital septum of the holotype is clearly true in the new specimen. In the holotype,we estimated that the narrow interorbital septum was half the width of the intersupratemporal region in terms of its ventral exposure.The new specimen shows an even narrower interorbital septum,less than 1/3 of the width of the intersupratemporal region. This is unique among known Chinese pachypleurosaur-like forms. In addition, in both the holotype and the new specimen the broad intersupratemporal region is morphologically comparable to that of Keichousaurus but differs from the latter in that there is no constriction at the posterior end of the region.

The new specimen is also identical to the holotype in the postcranial region. It has 41 presacral vertebrae, in contrast to 39 in Dianopachysaurus,38 in Diandongosaurus,and 36 in Dawazisaurus; its ribs are not pachyostotic; the first five caudal ribs are elongate and blunt distally; and the clavicle possesses a stout anterolateral process,differing from that of Diandongosaurus in which the process is slender and shaper.In addition, the new specimen also shares the following limb characteristics with the holotype: the long and slender profile, the presence of the entepicondylar foramen, the proximal head of the ulna expanded and wider than the distal end, the presence of two ossified tarsals and the rounded astragalus,the broadened $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ metatarsal. The only distinct difference is the number of the ossified carpals: three in the holotype and two in the new specimen.This may have reflected an ontogenetic variation,i.e, the fourth distal carpals had not started to co-ossify yet in the smaller new specimen which is $6 5 \mathrm { m m }$ shorter than the holotype in total length.Therefore,it is most probable that the number difference of the carpals between the holotype and the new specimen does not represent a true fact.

The data matrix used here is derived from that of Shang and Li (2015). In our analysis,Dawazisaurus (Cheng et al., 2O16) was also included and the character scores of Dianmeisaurus were modified based on new specimen (Appendix 1). With the addition of Dawazisaurus,the data matrix has 42 taxa and 139 characters.

The data matrix was analyzed using PAUP\* (version 4.0b10; Swofford,2002). Multistate characters were treated as unordered and all characters were equally weighted.A heuristic search of all 42 taxa yielded 207 most parsimonious trees (MPTs) with 750 steps,a CI of 0.4840, and a RI of 0.6318.Different from the results of Sato et al. (2014) and Shang and Li (2015),the strict consensus of the 2O7 MPTs indicated that the branching paterns changed drastically and the relationships among the Chinese pachypleurosaur-like taxa, the European pachypleurosaurs and the members of Nothosauroidea were all unsolved.

To test if the fragmentary taxa (Kwangsisaurus, Chinchenia and Sanchiaosaurus) would have influenced the results or not, we did a second analysis with the three fragmentary taxa excluded.A heuristic search of the removal of the three taxa yielded 8 shortest trees, with 706 steps,a CI of O.5142,and a RI of O.6676.The result of this analysis is largely comparable to that of the second analysis of Shang and Li (2O15), supporting the sister-taxon relationship between Dianmeisaurus and Diandongosaurus (Fig. 7). The Chinese pachypleurosaur-like Dianmeisaurus, Diandongosaurus, Majiashanosaurus, Dianopachysaurus, Keichousaurus, and Dawazisaurus formed a monophyletic clade and more closely related to the Nothosauroidea than to the European pachypleurosaurs. Qianxisaurus,Wumengosaurus, and Hanosaurus formed a set of successive sister-groups towards a clade containing the European pachypleurosaurs, the Nothosauroidea and the aforementioned six Chinese pachypleurosaurlike forms. The differences between Shang and Li (2O15) and the current study are that Keichousaurus is more basal in position than Dianopachysaurus within the Chinese clade and Hanosaurus is more remotely related to the Nothosauria than any of other Chinese pachypleurosaur-like forms.

The sister-group relationship between Dianmeisaurus and Diandongosaurus is supported by three unequivocal characters under ACCTRAN optimization, i.e.,the absence of pachyostosis in the dorsal ribs [72(O)], the presence of an anterolateral process in the clavicles [80(2)],and three carpal ossifications [137(1)].

The three fragmentary taxa from China (Chinchenia, Kwangsisaurus,and

Sanchiaosaurus) have different phylogenetic positions and are never grouped together in previous studies (Rieppel, 1999; Holmes et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2014; Shang and Li, 2015; Cheng et al.,2Ol6).As tested in the two analysis of this study,here is the case again that the poorly preserved taxa are largely influenced the internal branching patterns of the European pachypleurosaurs,Nothosauroidea,and Chinese pachypleurosaur-like forms.

# 3.3Morphological comparisons of the small sized eosauropterygians from the Luoping Fauna

Up to now, four smal-sized eosauropterygian taxa have been described from early Middle Triassic of Luoping. They are Diandongosaurus, Dianopachysaurus, Dianmeisaurus, and Dawazisaurus.All of them have an adult body length shorter than $5 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ and share the characters below: a slender body with litte specialized limbs,a skull with a large orbit and a small supratemporal fenestra, as well as a relatively elongate neck and tail.

Among these small eosauropterygians, the holotype of Dianopachysaurus dingi should be a juvenile,as indicated by the unfinished ends of the limb bones and the weak ossification of the skull bones.As preserved, the snout-pelvis (pre-caudal) length is about $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m m } }$ and the skull is $2 3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ long in the holotype of $D$ 、dingi(Liu et al., 2O11). The corresponding lengths reach separately to 194, $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in the holotype of Diandongosaurus acutidentatus (IVPP V 17761), 176 and $2 2 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in the holotype of Dianmeisaurus gracilis (V 18630),and 236 and $3 6 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in the holotype of Dawazisaurus brevis (Cheng et al., 2016).Although $D$ .dingiis based on a juvenile skeleton,its holotype is distinct in several diagnostic features, such as the broad parietal with a weak constriction at the posterior end,the presence of at least four carpal ossifications (Liu et al., 2O11). The holotype and the new specimen of $D$ gracilis are larger than the holotype of $D$ ，dingi but the carpals of the latter have fewer ossified elements, indicating that they could not be adults of Dianopachysaurus.In addition,as shown in the new specimen, the broad intersupratemporal region does not have a constriction at the posterior end in $D$ gracilis.The relatively long snout, the lack of the anterolateral process of the clavicle and the pachyostotic ribs further distinguish Dianopachysaurus from Dianmeisaurus.

D. brevis (Cheng et al.,2016) has a short trunk (16 dorsal vertebrae), very smal pre- and postzygapophyses and five ossified distal carpals. It is also distinct from $D$ . gracilis.

Although Dianmeisaurus is phylogenetically close to Diandongosaurus, the latter has the following autapomorphies which are demonstrably absent in the former: the nasals reduced and separated from one another by the premaxillae,the large nasal processes of the premaxillae extending backwards to insert into the frontal, the frontal excluded by the prefrontal-postfrontal contact from the dorsal margin of the orbit, the parietal skull table weakly constricted, the mandibular articulation displaced to a level distinctly behind the occipital condyle, the premaxilla excluded from the margin of the internal choana,and the intertrochanteric fossa distinct but reduced. The Dianmeisaurus differs from Diandongosaurus in the following autapomorphies: the frontals are paired, the coronoid process of lower jaw is distinct, the cervical centra are rounded, there are four sacral ribs,the clavicles and interclavicle are in a simple overlapping contact, and the external naris is retracted,with a longitudinal diameter distinctly less than half the longitudinal diameter of the orbit. In addition,the premaxillary fangs are not king-sized,the supratemporal fenestra is elongated elliptic, the interorbital septum extremely narrow, and the anterolateral process of the clavicle is much stouter.

摘要：根据一件产自云南罗平中三叠世关岭组I段的新标本并结合产自相同地点和地层中的模式标本对纤细滇美龙(Dianmeisaurus gracilis Shang&Li,2015)进行了详细研究。原模式标本暴露其腹面，而新标本暴露其背面，两者互相补充提供了更完整、精确的纤细滇美龙解剖学信息。新材料揭示该种具有非常短小的吻部，眶前区的长度不仅短于眶后区长度，甚至短于眼眶的长度；外鼻孔小且位置靠前，即鼻孔前区的长度短于鼻孔后缘与眼眶前缘之间的距离；由两额骨构成的眼眶间隔非常狭窄，宽度小于顶骨平台宽度的1/3;额骨前后两端均具渐尖的突起；顶骨后部不收缩，顶骨平台后缘呈深V型。补充了新信息和包含更多属种(如Dawazisaurus)后的系统发育学分析支持了之前滇美龙和滇东龙互为姊妹群的结论，同时它们和马家山龙、滇肿龙、贵州龙和大洼子龙一起构成了一个仅由中国的属种组成的单系类群。与欧洲肿肋龙类群(Dactylosaurus,Anarosaurus,Serpianosaurus和Neusticosaurus)相比，这一单系类群与幻龙类有更近的亲缘关系。
