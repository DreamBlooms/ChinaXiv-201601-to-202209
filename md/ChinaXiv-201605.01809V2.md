# Introduction

Stem cell fate determination is critical for embryonic development,and tissue homeostasis (Julian etal.,20l3).Perturbation of the proliferation or differentiation process results ina reduced or excessive number of neurons,which leads to cortical malfunctions (Fang etal.,2O13).Identifying mechanisms of neural stem cell (NSC) regulation will have important clinical implications.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have emerged as critical regulators of NSC self-renewal and maintenance.BMP pathway components are highly expressed in both embryonic and adult neurogenic niches (Morrison and Spradling, 2oo8; Mira et al.,201O).NSC populations can be expanded by blocking BMP signaling (Bonaguidi et al.,2oo8).Moreover,accumulating evidence has implicated BMP signaling in the cognitive decline associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases (Limke and Rao,2002; Chen et al.,2003). Increased BMP signaling results in cognitive impairments,whereas decreased BMP signaling improves cognition (Doetsch,2003; Gobeske et al.,2009). For example,the overexpression of BMPs has been associated with decreased neurogenesis in mouse models of AD(Lim et al.,2000; Crews and Masliah,201O).Additionally,BMP gain of function causes a reduction in neurogenesis that can be blocked by noggin overexpression (Tang etal.,2009).

Yes-associated protein(YAP）is involved in the BMPsuppressed differentiation of embryonic NSCs through a direct interactionwith Smad1(Alarcón etal.,2oo9).Inaddition,several lines of evidence suggest that YAP participates in regulating NSC behavior (Cao etal.,2008; Fernandez et al.,2009; Gee et al.,2011). Interestingly, theDrosophila gene Yorkie,the homologof YAP, maintains neuroepithelial cells in an undifferentiated state (Zhang etal.,2O11).TEA domain(TEAD) family members are key target transcription factors that mediate YAP function (Zhao et al.,2oo8),and YAP-TEAD transcriptional activity is involved in stem cell proliferation (Lian et al.,201O; Ramos and Camargo, 2012).Additionally,Dpp, the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian BMP family,controls tissue growth by regulating the transcriptionof Bantam (Zhang etal.,2O13).Because Bantam is the downstream target of the Hippo-Yki/Sd pathway, this work established an important link between Dpp and Hippo/Yki signaling,although the ability of this cross talk to regulate the proliferation ofNSCs in mammals remains to be explored.Above all, both BMP2 signaling and the Hippo pathway play indispensable roles in governing NSC proliferation and differentiation.However,how these two pathways regulate the behavior of embryonic NSCs remains unclear.

In our study,loss-of-function experiments reveal that YAP mediates the BMP2-induced inhibition of embryonic NSC proliferation.Moreover,we show thatBMP2- triggered Smadl nuclear translocation competes with YAP for the interaction with TEAD,resulting in the downregulation of target genes,and we identify ccnd1 asa critical target that regulates in this process. Our findings suggest a new molecular mechanism for the connection of the Hippo/YAP and BMP2 pathways in the regulation of embryonic NSC proliferation,in whichBMP2 stimulation inhibits the transcriptional activityofYAP-TEAD, reducing cell cycle ccndl expression and thus decreasing NSC proliferation.

# MaterialsandMethods

Cultures ofNSCs.NSC cultures were generated as described previously(Azari etal.,2Ol1).The female mouse El4 ganglionic eminence was dissected and mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension with a fire-polished Pasteurpipette. Cells were seeded in noncoated T-25 culture flasks in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) containing $2 \%$ B27 (Invitrogen), $2 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ epidermal growth factor (ProSpec),and $2 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ basic fibroblast growth factor(ProSpec） at a density of $\mathrm { 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 ~ c e l l s / m l }$ Primary neurospheres were dissociated by incubation with Accutase (Millipore) and reseeded in fresh media at $\mathrm { 5 0 , 0 0 0 ~ c e l l s / m l }$ until secondary spheres were generated.All spheres used for experiments were passaged at least once.BMP2 (R&D),Noggin (ProSpec),MG132(Sigma), and CHX(Sigma) were used at the indicated concentrations.

Infection.Neurospheres were gently dissociated by Accutase (Millipore） treatment,and $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ cells/well were plated in 12-well tissueculture plates.Virus was then added for $_ { 4 - 6 \mathrm { h } }$ .Cells were transferred to $1 0 \mathrm { c m }$ tissue-culture dishes with $8 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of fresh medium and cultured for $5 \mathrm { d }$ to medium-sized neurospheres.Neurospheres infected with retrovirus were selected by culturing in medium containing puromycin for $3 \mathrm { d }$ ， and surviving cells were used in experiments.

Expression constructs. 3xFlag-tagged Smad1 construct was in the pCMV10 expression vector.YAP1-28(Gaffney etal.,2012; Sudol,2013) coding sequence was subcloned into the pCMV-Myc or pCMV10-3xFlag expression vector.HA-TEADl construct was in the pCDNA3.1-HA expression vector. YAP-WT and YAP-WW constructs were in the retroviral pQCXIH expression vector.

# BMP2 represses embryonic NSC proliferation and self-renewal

BMP2 is a multifunctional growth factor and a highly expressed BMP family member in adult mouse NSCs (Chen et al., 2004)，suggesting a significant role for BMP2 in this cell type.Previous studies have suggested that BMP signaling plays an important role in maintaining NSC quiescence in the adult brain (Johnston and Lim,201O).Noggin,a BMP antagonist, can block its activation.

We first explored whether BMP2 activation impacts the self-renewal and proliferation of mouse embryonic NSCs by performing the in vitro neurosphere assay (Vanderluit et al.，2004).Neurosphere size and the number of multipotent neurospheres generated during passaging reflect the growth and self-renewal activity of mouse NSCs (Ahmed et al.,2009). Mouse NSCs cultured in the proliferating condition in vitro treated with BMP2 produced fewer neurospheres with smaller size than the controls (Fig. 1A,B),suggesting that BMP2 activation inhibited the self-renewal and proliferation of NSCs.To confirm these results,we quantified the number of proliferating NSCs by performing the BrdU incorporation （S phase)analysis.BMP2 treatment resulted in an average $2 0 \%$ decrease in the size of the BrdU-positive population (Fig. $_ { 1 C , D }$ ), and the decrease in proliferation was not due to differentiation because the NSC marker Nestin was expressed in the cultured neurospheres (Fig.1C).In addition, we found that mouse NSCs exposed to BMP2 exhibited a $1 5 \%$ reduction in the $\mathrm { S } / \mathrm { G } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { M }$ phase and a $1 5 \%$ increase in the $\mathrm { G } _ { 0 } / \mathrm { G } _ { 1 }$ phase by flow cytometry analysis (Fig.1E).Consistent with the increased proportion of cells in $\mathrm { G } _ { 0 } / \mathrm { G } _ { 1 }$ ,the population of Ki67-positive cells was significantly reduced ( $2 5 \%$ decrease in BMP2-treated NSCs compared with the untreated cells; Fig. $1 F$ ). Noggin (the BMP antagonist) treatment partially rescued the proliferation inhibition induced by BMP2 signaling(Fig.1).BMP2 activation represses mouse embryonic NSC self-renewal and proliferation.

# YAP is required for BMP2-induced proliferation inhibition in embryonic NSCs

Previous studies in chick neural tube and Xenopuslaevis embryosrevealed that the proliferation of neuroepithelial cells is strongly influenced by YAP activity（Hiemer and Varelas,2013). To investigate whetherYAPwasessentialfor thereduced proliferation of embryonic NSCs induced by BMP2,we performed loss-of-function studies.Mouse NSCs were infected with a bicistronic retrovirus-expressing GFP and short hairpins for YAP (shYAP)or scrambled control sequence (Fig. 2A). Knockdownof YAP reduced the diameters and numbers of neurospheres (Fig. $2 B , C )$ ， and YAP deficiency abrogated the BMP2- mediated repression ofNSC proliferation, indicating that BMP2 represses mouse NSC self-renewal through the YAP protein.Further,BrdU incorporation,Ki67 staining,and cell cycle analysis showed that YAP was the target of BMP2 signaling in regulating proliferation of NSCs （Fig. $2 D { - } F$ ).YAP is required for the BMP2- induced proliferation inhibition of mouse embryonic NSCs.

# BMP2 represses YAP-TEAD transcriptional activity in embryonic NSCs

Previous studies have suggested thatYAPTEAD can induce the expansion of neural progenitors during neural tube development (Hiemer and Varelas,20l3).Here, we performed the 3xSD-luc reporter assay (Wang et al.,2011) to examine the effect ofBMP2 on YAP-TEAD-mediated transcriptional activity.We observed that BMP2 treatment decreased YAP-TEAD transcriptional activity,and noggin pretreatment could reverse the inhibition of BMP2 (Fig. 3A). The coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that YAP formed a physical complex with TEAD1 (Fig. ${ } _ { 3 B , C ) }$ ,and the interaction between YAP and TEAD1 was reduced by BMP2 treatment (Fig. ${ } _ { 3 B , C ) }$ .Consistently,the colocalization of YAP-TEAD1 in nucleus is decreased with BMP2 treatment (Fig. $\left. 3 D \right.$ ).As a transcriptional cofactor,the nuclear translocation of YAP is tightly regu lated by the upstream kinases MST/LAST (Zhang etal.,20o8).We then investigated the subcellular localization of YAP during BMP2 treatment.We found that YAP was predominantly found in the nuclei of untreated cells,while BMP2 treatment increased the cytosolic levels of YAP and decreased its nuclear localization (Fig. 3E).These data suggest that BMP2 signaling reduces YAP-TEAD1-mediated transactivation through the regulation of the colocalization of YAP-TEAD1.

BMP2 treatment increases the Smad1/4-YAP interaction In our experiments,we observed that BMP2 treatment induced the activation ofthe Smad-mediated transcription (BRE-luciferase reporter),while reducing the YAP-TEAD-mediated transactivation (3xSD-luciferase reporter; Fig.4A). The YAP-TEAD reporter activity was gradually restored after BMP2 washout (Fig. 4B).As the major downstream effectors of BMP2,Smadl,Smad5,and Smad8 become phosphorylated and form a complex with Smad4 upon BMP2 treatment, followed by their nuclear translocation (Chen et al.,2004).Previous studies have shown that YAP interacts with endogenous Smad1 (Alarc6n et al.,2009). In our experiments,we confirmed that YAP interacts with Smadl,and also found that the interaction between YAP and Smad1 is reduced when the WW motifs are mutated (Bork and Sudol, 1994; Sudol, 1994; Chen and Sudol, 1995),which indicates that YAP interacts with Smadl via the WW domain (Fig. 4C).We consistently found that BMP2 treatment increased the endogenous interaction of YAP and Smadl or Smad4 (Fig. 4D). It has been reported that YAP could interact with the protein,which has the $\mathrm { P P x Y }$ motif (Chen et al.,1997).We constructed the mutant plasmid Smad1 Y227A,which is speculated to be unable to interact with YAP (Bork and Sudol, 1994; Sudol, 1994; Chen and Sudol,1995). Western blot analysis confirmed that YAP WW mutant could not interact with Smadl,whereas there is still a weak interaction between Smad1 Y227A and YAP.And there is no interaction between YAP WW and Smad1 Y227A (Fig. 4E). To investigate whether YAP WW was involved in YAP-TEAD transactivation response to BMP2,we performed 3xSD-luc reporter assay. BMP2 treatment reduces WT,but not WW domainmutated, YAP-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig.4F).Furthermore,we certified YAP WW function in the neurosphere assay.Mouse embryonic NSCs infected with retroviral YAP WT or YAP WW formed neurospheres at a higher frequency and with a larger size than control,indicating an increase of proliferation.Meanwhile,YAP WW overexpression,not the YAP WT overexpression,could block the BMP2-induced proliferation decrease(Fig.4G-I),indicating that BMP2's inhibitory function is dependent on the WW domain of YAP. Our findings suggest that BMP2 treatment increases YAP interaction with Smad1/4 via WW domain and reduces the YAP-TEAD1 transactivation in regulating mouse NSC proliferation.

Given that Smad4 forms a physical complex with phosphorylated Smad1 and is responsible for transporting phosphorylated Smadl into the nucleus upon BMP2 treatment,we asked whether the ablation of Smad4 could result in the increased proliferation of NSCs in the presence of BMP2.RT-PCR analysis confirmed that Smad4 shRNAhad a $4 0 \%$ knockdown efficiency (Fig. 5A).Embryonic NSCs infected with Smad4 shRNA retrovirus showed increased proliferation,forming neurospheres ata higher frequency with a larger size(Fig.5B-D) in the presence of BMP2.Consistent with the above findings,Smad4 knockdown increased YAPmediated transcription(Fig. 5E) and the interaction of YAP and TEAD1 (Fig.5F). In addition,we observed that there were more nuclear locations of YAP in Smad4- knockdown murine NSCs (Fig. $5 G , H$ ） Thus,the decreased interaction between YAP and TEAD in response to the activated BMP2 signals could be explained by Smadl/4 competitively binding to YAP. This effect reveals a novel mechanism for the regulation of BMP2-induced inhibitionofNSCproliferation， possibly through YAP/TEAD,the core components of the Hippo pathway.

# Ccnd1 is a target of YAP-TEAD signaling in theBMP2-induced inhibition ofNSC proliferation

To identify target genes involved in YAPTEAD-regulated NSC proliferation，we performed RT-PCR on three independent samples.We observed that ccndl expression had a $4 0 \%$ reduction by either BMP2 treatment(Fig.6A) orknockdown of YAP or TEAD1(Fig. $6 B , C )$ ，indicating that ccnd1 is a potential target of YAP/TEAD1 in the proliferation of mouse NSCs.Previous studies have shown that ccndl affects cell growth and that elevated ccnd1 expression levels accelerate cell cycle progression (Kim and Diehl,2009).To deter

or knockdown of ccnd1 in NSCs decreases the diameters (E) and the number of neurospheres (F).Mouse NSCs were infected with control, ccnd1,and shRNA retrovirus.Neurospheres were grown for7d after infection $\begin{array} { r } { ( \mathsf { A N O V A } ; n \geq 3 , } \end{array}$ （204号 $p < 0 . 0 1 \$ .G,Mouse NSCs were infected with control,YAPWT, and YAPWW retrovirus.Total RNA was isolated from infected NSCs.The expression of ccnd1 was determined by ${ \mathfrak { q } } { \mathsf { P } } { \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { R } }$ and normalized to GAPDH.YAP WW overexpression blocks the ccnd1 decrease induced by BMP2.H,ChlP analysis showed that YAP WW blocked the reduced expression of ccnd1 induced by BMP2 treatment.

mine whether YAP directly regulates the transcription of ccnd1 in NSCs,we performed a ChIP assay.We found that the occupancy of YAP on the promoter region of the ccndl gene was decreased $\sim 5 0 \%$ in response to BMP2 treatment (Fig.6D). To further determine the importance of ccndl in murine NSC proliferation，we performed a neurosphere assay in vitro using retroviral ccnd1- shRNA.As expected,ccnd1 knockdown significantly reduced NSC growth by $4 0 \%$ (Fig.6E)and self-renewal capacity by ${ \sim } 4 0 \%$ (Fig.6F).Inaddition,we observed thatBMP2 treatment failed to furtherreduce the proliferation of NSCs upon ccnd1 knockdown compared with the control (Fig. $\phantom { 0 } { 6 E , F }$ ).Our gain-of-function studies showed thatYAPWTor YAP WW overexpression could elevate twofold ccndlmRNAlevel,whereasYAPWW,not YAP WT,could block the BMP2-induced inhibition of ccnd1 expression (Fig. 6G). Consistently,we found that the occupancy ofoverexpressed YAPWT or YAP WW on the promoter region of the ccnd1 gene was increased ${ \sim } 3 5 \%$ (Fig. $6 H$ ） However,the expression ofYAPWW mutant blocked the BMP2-induced occupancy reduction in response to BMP2 treatment (Fig. 6H). Our data strongly suggest that ccndl is a direct target of the YAPTEAD1 transcriptional complex in the process of BMP2-inhibited mouse embryonic NSC proliferation

# Discussion

This study presents three key discoveries.First,we showed that BMP2 signaling represses murine embryonic NSC proliferation through YAP,the core downstream effector of the Hippo pathway.Second,BMP2 inhibits the pro-proliferation function of YAP by increasing the interaction between Smadl/4and YAP and decreasing YAP-TEAD1 interaction.Third,we revealed a transcriptional mechanismby which YAP/TEAD regulates ccndl expression in response to BMP2 signaling in regulating murine embryonic NSC proliferation. The working model is illustrated in Figure 7.

# YAP is required for the BMP2-induced suppression of murine embryonic NSC proliferation

BMPs elicit several different responses in mouse embryonic NSCs,including withdrawal from the cell cycle;differentiation into astrocytes,neurons, or neural crest-like cells; and apoptosis (Lim et al.,200o; Bonaguidi et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2009). These various responses depend on the BMP and BMP receptors involved and the presence of other signaling.We found that embryonic NSCs cultured in vitro with BMP2 treatment arrested more in the $\mathrm { G } _ { 0 } / \mathrm { G } _ { 1 }$ phase while retaining NSC marker expression and the capacity to proliferate.This finding is consistent with the fact that BMP2 reduces mouse embryonic NSC proliferation while mostof the cells are undifferentiated (Alarcón etal.,2009). As the key downstream mediator of the Hippo pathway,YAP controls the balance of stem cell self-renewal,proliferation,and differentiation (Ramos and Camargo,20l2).However, there is little mechanistic insight into how YAP regulates stem cell properties.A recent study by Lian et al. (20l0) suggests that in murine embryonic stem cells,YAP directly binds to the pro moters of genes that enhance pluripotency,which suggests that YAP may be a key component of the core pluripotency machinery.We observed that YAP knockdown blocked BMP2-induced inhibition of mouse embryonic NSC proliferation in vitro (Fig.2).Alarcón et al. (2009)reported that YAP increases Smad1-dependent transcription and is required for BMP suppression of neural differentiation of mouse embry onic stem cells.Our experiments showed that YAP WW could not interact with Smadl and blocked the proliferation inhibition induced by BMP2 treatment. Our data suggest that YAP is involved in the BMP2-induced suppression of mouse embryonic NSC proliferation.

Figure7．Working model: BMP2-SMAD signaling represss theproliferationofmurineembryonicNSCs throughYAP.A,Inthe absence ofBMP2,Smadand Smad4 remaininthecytoplasm,andYAP/TEAD1transcriptionallyupregulatesccnd1 expresion leading to the increased proliferationofmouse NSCs.B,Upon BMP2treatment,the Smad1/4complexis transported into the nucleusandcompeteswithTEAD1forbinding toYAP,thusrepressingccnd1 expressionandresultingintherepressionofmouse NSC proliferation.This fine-tuning signaling maintains the proper expansion of the mouse NSC pool.

TAZ is a paralog of YAP and both YAP and TAZ share significant sequence similarity and redundant functions.Moreover, the regulatory mechanism of transcriptional activation is similar between YAP and TAZ(Kanai et al.,20oo).However, recent studies suggested thatYAP might functiondifferentially from TAZ in stem cell biology.For example,YAP is identified as transcriptional coactivator in stem cell proliferation whereas TAZ has been shown to function as a transcriptional coactivator implicated in modulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (Hong and Guan,2012).We observed that YAP knockdown does not affect the TAZ expression,indicating that the YAPknockdown phenotype is independent on TAZ.It is still interesting to further investigate the functional interaction of YAP and TAZ in stem cells.

# BMP2 enhances the YAP-Smad1/4 interactionand decreases YAP/TEAD transcriptional activity

Based on our findings,we present a model showing how YAP mediates the BMP2-induced modulation of embryonic NSC proliferation (Fig.7).BMP2 increases the YAP-Smadl/4 interaction that promotes YAP's cytoplasmic translocation and thus inhibits thephysical interactionbetween YAPand TEAD.Thedissociation of YAP and TEAD results in the cell cycle exit of mouse embryonic NSCs.YAP-TEAD transcriptional activity was consistently increased, concurrent with the increased interaction of YAP and TEAD upon Smad4knockdown (Fig.5F).Meanwhile, we observed that mouse embryonic NSCs produced more neurospheres withlarger sizes in the absence of Smad4 under BMP2 treatment (Fig. $^ { 5 C , D }$ ).We also found that YAP accumulated more in the nucleus following Smad4 knockdown in response to BMP2.We propose that the following two possibilities may underlie theBMP2-mediated inhibitionofYAPnuclearaccumulation and the YAP-TEAD transactivation in mouse NSCs.One possibility is that,upon BMP2 treatment,Smadl/4 proteins transport YAP out of the nucleus,resulting in the reduction of YAP-TEAD binding; another possibility is that the nuclear Smadl/4 competes with TEADs for the binding of YAP,which might release YAP from the YAP/TEAD complex followed by YAP transport out of the nucleus.The exact mechanism whereby Smads regulate YAP translocation and activation needs to be further investigated.

# Ccnd1 is the direct target of YAP/TEAD in response to BMP2activation

We screened candidate YAP-TEAD target genes in the BMP2 modulation of mouse NSC proliferation,especially focusing on genes regulating the $\mathbf { G } _ { 1 }$ -S phase transition.p21,one known $\mathrm { G } _ { 1 } { - } S$ phase regulator,is previously reported involved in the cell cycle arrest of mouse NSCs.However,we found that p21 was not the direct target of YAP-TEAD in mouse NSCs.Consistent with our findings,cell cycle withdrawal of mouse NSCs is not fully abolished in p21-deficient mice,suggesting that another signaling pathway is also involved (Mathieu etal.,20o8).Another cell cycle factor ccndl was reported as a potential YAP-TEAD target gene (Mizuno etal.,2Ol2).We found that both the transactivation of YAP/TEAD and expression of ccnd1 decreased in the presence of BMP2 treatment in mouse NSC,indicating that ccndl might be one of the major downstream targets of mouse NSC proliferation.Further,we confirmed ccnd1 involved in BMP2-induced mouse NSC proliferation inhibition (Fig.6E,F).Finally,our ChIP data (Fig. $6 D$ )indicate that ccndl is the direct target gene of YAP/TEAD in response to BMP2.

In summary,we conclude that YAP/TEAD is involved in the BMP2-induced inhibition of embryonic NSC proliferation,and we investigate the molecular mechanism,in which Smadl/4 inhibits YAP transactivation by competing with TEAD binding.We also discovered that ccndl is the major transcriptional target of YAP in BMP2-mediated proliferation repression in mouse NSCs. This proposed model for the cross talk of BMP signaling and the Hippo pathway in mouse embryonic NSC proliferation will greatly advance our understanding of mouse NSC physiology. Furthermore,the cross talk between BMP and Hippo-YAP pathway in mouse NSCs could be exploited as a target of drugs that could help to control neurodegenerative diseases.
