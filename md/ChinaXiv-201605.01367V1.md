Herewe reporttatinmice symbiotic bacteriadirectedselectivecargosorting inPanethcels topromote symbiosis through Nod2,acytosolicbacterialsensor,andthe multifunctionalprotein kinaseLRRK2,bothencodedbyinflammatoryboweldisease (IBD)-associatedgenes.Commensals recruitedNod2onto lysozyme-containingdensecore vesicles (DCVs),whichwasrequired for DCVlocalizationofLRRK2andasmall GTPase,Rab2a.Deficiencyof Nod2,LRRK2orRab2aordepletionofcommensals resultedinlysosomaldegradationof lysozyme.Thus,commensalbacteriaandhostfactorsorchestrate the lysozyme-sorting process to protect the host from enteric infection,implicating Paneth celldysfunction in IBD pathogenesis.

Intestinal homeostasis depends on proper interactions between the mucosal immune system and intestinal microbiota.The complex nature of the symbiotic interactions between the host and microbes is beginning to be explored.Commensals can alter gene transcription, induce epigenetic modification and promote the differentiation of specific cell lineagesl-3.However,many other possible mechanisms of symbiotic interactions remain to be explored.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a clinical manifestation of disturbed intestinal homeostasis arising from the interaction between environmental and genetic factors.IBD includes two main forms: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Three major NOD2 mutations have been associated with Crohn'sdisease4,5.NOD2 encodes a cytosolic bacterial sensor that induces the expression of cytokines and antimicrobial peptide genes in response to the bacterial peptidoglycan muramyl dipeptide (MDP). $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice have been widely used to investigate the function of Nod2 in mucosal immunity and intestinal inflammation. $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice have an altered composition of commensal bacteria and increased susceptibility to enteric infection and piroxicam-induced ileitis6-8.However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the intestinal abnormalities in $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice remain to be further investigated.LRRK2,originally identified as the gene mutated in familial Parkinson's disease,was found to be a major susceptibility gene for $\mathrm { I B D } ^ { 9 - 1 3 }$ . LRRK2 encodes a large cytosolic protein kinase whose function in mucosal immunity is not fully understood14,15.

Paneth cells,a group of secretory cells located at the bottom of small intestinal crypts,have a vital role in maintaining the function of the epithelial barrier by secretinga range ofantimicrobial peptides (AMPs) into the intestinal lumen.The AMPs secreted by Paneth cells include cryptdin, ${ \mathrm { R e g 3 } } \gamma ,$ lysozyme and others16.Depleting Paneth cells in mice results ina compromised intestinal barrier and enhanced translocation and dissemination of pathogens17.Several IBD-associated genes affect the function of Paneth cell6,18-24, which suggests that dysfunctional Paneth cells might underlie the pathogenesis of IBD. Currently,many important cellular processes in Paneth cells,such as intracellular trafficking of AMPs,are not fully understood.

Within Paneth cells,the various AMPs are sorted after synthesis into specialized secretory granules called dense core vesicles (DCVs). Not much is known about the mechanisms by which cargos are selectively sorted and transported into DCVs after they exit the trans-Golgi network.A sorting-by-retention mechanism has been suggested by a study in C.elegans showing that loss of Rab2a function leads to specific lysosomal degradation ofa neuropeptide²5.Whether such a mechanism exists in mammalian cells remains unknown.

Here we investigated the function of LRRK2 in mucosal immunity,which ledus to the discovery that symbiotic bacteria direct a DCV cargo-sorting process to promote symbiosis.We found high expression of LRRK2 in Paneth cells,and LRRK2 deficiency caused a specific deprivation of lysozyme in Paneth cells,which rendered $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice more susceptible to intestinal but not systemic Listeria monocytogenes infection. The lysozyme defect in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells was due to failed recruitment of Rab2a onto the DCV surface. In addition, the presence of luminal biota was required forDCV sorting of lysozyme.In germ-free (GF) mice lysozyme was targeted for lysosomal degradation rather than secretion in Paneth cells.Finally, we determined that Nod2 was responsible for sensing commensal bacteria to direct lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells.Collectively, our data demonstrate that commensal bacteria direct lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells through a Nod2-LRRK2-Rab2a axis,which in turn is important in controlling intestinal infection.

# RESULTS

Enhanced susceptibility of $L r r k 2 ^ { - 1 - }$ mice to intestinal infection To determine the physiological function of LRRK2,we carried out immunofluorescence staining of mouse ileal sections.We noted high expression of LRRK2 in lysozyme-positive Paneth cells (Fig.la,b), as well as in myeloid cells in the lamina propria (data not shown),as previously reported15.We confirmed the specificity of LRRK2 immunostaining by simultaneously immunostaining ileal sections from $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice as controls (Supplementary Fig.la).Immunoblotting analysis also indicated the expression of LRRK2 in sorted $\mathrm { C D } 2 4 ^ { + }$ Paneth cells (Supplementary Fig.1b,c).LRRK2 was concentrated on the surface of DCVs,as identified by lysozyme staining or granule structures in differential interference contrast images (Fig.1b).To determine whether LRRK2 was required for the bactericidal function of Paneth cells,we orally infected wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice with the Gram-positive intracellular bacterium L.monocytogenes,as the bactericidal activity ofPaneth cells is required for effective clearance of this pathogen6,20.Bacterial loads were significantly increased in fecal samples and liver from infected $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice compared with those from wild-type mice (Fig.1c).We noticed a similar trend in the spleen,but the difference was not significant (Fig.lc).We observed no difference between wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice in the number of bacteria recovered from liver and spleen 24 or $^ { 4 8 \mathrm { h } }$ after infection by intravenous injection of L. monocytogenes (Supplementary Fig.1d), which indicated that LRRK2 deficiency leads to a specific defect in controlling intestinal infection.

Because Paneth cells can modulate intestinal microbiota,we investigated whether changes in intestinal flora in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice could influence their susceptibility to intestinal $L$ monocytogenes infectionl6.We deep sequenced 16s rRNA genes of intestinal microbes from wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice. Taxonomy-based analysis did not show any broad alterations in the phylum or family composition of bacterial commensals in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice compared with that in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig.le,f).However, some changes were observed for several minor families (Supplementary Table 1). For example,the relative abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae in the Firmicute phylum was higher in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice than in wild-type mice 0 $0 . 5 8 \%$ in wild-type mice versus $3 . 1 \%$ in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice, $P < 0 . 0 1$ ） Principal-component analysis showed differential clustering patterns of intestinal microbiota communities between wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice (Supplementary Fig.lg).These results indicate thatLRRK2 deficiency leads to alternations in microbial composition.However, further investigations that carefully consider the effects of the housing facility,caging and maternal transmission on the variation of microbial communities are required for more conclusive conclusions regarding the effect of Lrrk2 deletion on microbiota composition.For the purpose of this study,to determine whether the altered microbiota in the $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice affected their susceptibility to $L$ .monocytogenes infection,we transferred stool samples from wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice to GF mice and orally infected the recipient mice with L.monocytogenes 2 weeks later.We did not observe significant differences in the L.monocytogenes burden between the two groups of recipient mice (Fig.1d),which indicated that the alterations in the intestinal flora in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice did not affect their susceptibility to intestinal Listeria infection.These results suggest that LRRK2 deficiencyleads toa defectin the control of intestinal infection and that this defect is independent of altered microbiota in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice.

LRRK2 deficiency leads to lysozyme deficiency in Paneth cells We asked how LRRK2 deficiency might affect the bactericidal activity of Paneth cells.Periodic acid-Schiff staining did not reveal any apparent morphological difference between Paneth cells from wildtype and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice (Supplementary Fig.2a).However, electron microscopy analysis showed an increased percentage of DCVs with enlarged halo regions in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells compared with wild-type

Paneth cells,which suggested defects during DCV maturation (SupplementaryFig.2b,c).We investigatedwhether the composition of AMPs was altered in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells.Immunostaining showed an almost complete absence of lysozyme in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells (Fig.2a,b). Of note,in DCVs localized away from the apical side of Paneth cells,referred to here as subapical DCVs,lysozyme staining was similar in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ and wild-type Paneth cells (Fig.2a). The expression of other AMPs in DCVs such as precursors of cryptdin (procryptdin） and $\mathrm { R e g } 3 \gamma$ was similar in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ and wild-type Paneth cells (Fig.2c and Supplementary Fig.2d),which suggested that the lack of lysozyme in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells was not due to a generaldefectinDCV formation.Panethcells secreteDCV-derivedAMPs when exposed to bacterial antigens or bacteria in vitro26.Supernatants and celllysates from isolated crypts from $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice were devoid of lysozyme (Fig.2d) and showed significantly decreased bactericidal activityagainst L.monocytogenes (Fig.2e) compared with those from wild-type mice.Lectin-Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) staining of whole mounts of ileum showed colocalization of lysozyme with mucus in the intestinal lumens of wild-type mice;however, there was a lack of lysozyme staining in the mucus of $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice (Fig.2f).In contrast,procryptdin staining in the intestinal lumen was similar between wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice (Supplementary Fig.2e),indicating normal DCV exocytosis in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells. Thus,Lrrk2 deficiency leads to a specific impairment in the expression of lysozyme,but not of other cargos such as procryptdin,in Paneth cells.

To determine whether decreased lysozyme secretion was responsible for the impaired clearance of intestinal L.monocytogenes in

$L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice,we supplemented wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice with recombinant lysozyme or PBS(vehicle) by oral gavage fora week before orally infecting them with $L$ 、monocytogenes (Supplementary Fig.2f).Lysozyme supplementation markedly reduced the bacterial burden of $L$ .monocytogenes in feces and liver in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice compared with vehicle-treated $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice (Fig. 2g),but it had no effect on wild-type mice (Fig.2g).These results suggest that $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice have deficient lysozyme expression in Paneth cells and that this is the major cause of their increased susceptibility to intestinal L.monocytogenes infection.

# Lysozyme in $L r r k 2 ^ { - 1 - }$ Paneth cells is degraded in lysosomes

To uncover the molecular mechanism underlying lysozyme deficiency in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells,we cultured crypt organoids,which contain authentic Paneth cells²7,from mouse ileal sections.Unlike wild-type Paneth cells (Supplementary Fig.3a),cultured $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells did not contain detectable lysozyme protein (Fig.3a), whereas lysozyme mRNA expression was comparable between isolated wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ crypts (Fig.3b). These data suggest that the lack of lysozyme in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells is due to a posttranscriptional defect. Treatment with leupeptin,a lysosomal inhibitor,orBrefeldinA,an inhibitorof protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus,effectively restored lysozyme protein in cultured $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells as determined by immunostaining and immunoblotting (Fig. $_ { 3 \mathbf { a } , \mathbf { c } }$ and Supplementary Fig.3b).In contrast,knockdown of Rab27a,a small GTPase essential for DCV exocytosis,by transfection of the cultured organoids

with a Rab27a-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA）oligo failed to restore lysozyme in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells compared with expression in organoids transfected with control siRNA,as determined by immunostaining (Supplementary Fig.3c).These data collectively indicate thatLrrk2 deficiency leads to the degradation of lysozyme in lysosomes.

# LRRK2 recruits Rab2a onto DCVs for lysozyme sorting

DCV cargo sorting begins in the trans-Golgi network and persists throughout DCV maturation,during which factors not destined for DCVs are directed to the endosomal-lysosomal route28,29. During maturation,DCVs in Paneth cells are transported toward the apical side.On the basis of our observation that lysosome inhibition restored lysozyme in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells,we tested whether LRRK2 deficiency altered the intracellular trafficking of DCV cargos. We employed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify LRRK2-interaction partners potentially implicated in DCV biogenesis and maturation (Supplementary Table 2). Two DCVlocalized GTPases，Rab2a and Rabl0,interacted with LRRK2 (Fig.4a).Rab2ais required forDCV cargo sorting in C.elegans, and loss of Rab2a results in lysosomal degradation of a mis-sorted neuropeptide25,30. C. elegans Rab10 mutants have severely defective DCV secretion31.We stained procryptdin to visualize DCVs in both wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells （Fig. $\mathbf { 4 b , c }$ ).Rab10localization was similar in wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells (Fig.4b). In contrast,Rab2a was largely undetectable in DCVs in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells,except fora few subapical DCVs (Fig.4c,d),whereas Rab2a was localized to DCVs in wild-type Paneth cells (Fig. 4c,d). Coimmunoprecipitation revealed interaction between LRRK2 and Rab2a when the proteins were overexpressed in HEK293T cells and between the endogenous proteins in isolated crypts (Fig.4e-g). These observations suggest that LRRK2 might physically recruit Rab2a onto the DCV surface.

To determine whether Rab2a is required for lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells,we transfected cultured organoids with two different Rab2a-specific siRNA oligos or control siRNA.Transfection with Rab2a-specific oligos effectively reduced the amounts of Rab2a in cultured organoids relative to the amounts observed after transfection with control siRNA (Supplementary Fig.3d).Rab2a knockdown did not affect amounts of LRRK2 (Supplementary Fig.3d),but it led to the disappearance of lysozyme in Rab2a-specific siRNA-transfected Paneth cells compared with Paneth cells transfected with control siRNA(Fig.4h).Furthermore,lysozyme in Paneth cells transfected with Rab2a siRNA was restored by lysosomal inhibition with leupeptin treatment as determined by immunostaining (SupplementaryFig.3e). These results suggest that Rab2a deficiency leads to lysosomal degradation of lysozyme.Thus,our data support a role of the LRRK2-Rab2a axis in controlling specific cargo sorting in DCVs.

Commensal bacteria are required for lysozyme sorting in GF mice We next asked whether commensal bacteria might regulate the lysozyme-sorting process. Whole-mount staining showed an absence of lysozyme in the intestinal lumens of GF mice,whereas the expression of procryptdin was similar between GF and specificpathogen-free(SPF) mice(Fig.5a,b).However,amounts of lysozyme mRNA and protein detected by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining of ileal sections were similar between GF and SPF mice (Supplementary Fig.4a,b),consistent with previous reports32,33.We next used immunofluorescence staining to analyze the distribution of lysozyme in Paneth cells in more detail.In ileal sections from GF mice,DCVs in Paneth cells showed a heterogeneous lysozyme-stainingpattern,with apicalDCVs having diminished lysozyme staining,compared with DCVs in Paneth cells from SPF mice (Fig.5c,d and SupplementaryFig.4c).In contrast to the heterogeneity of lysozyme staining in DCVs in GF mice,immunostaining revealed that procryptdin was more homogeneously distributed among DCVs throughout Paneth cells in GF mice (Fig.5c).The protein amount of lysozyme was greatly reduced in crypts isolated from GF mice compared with crypts from SPF mice (Supplementary Fig.4d). Inhibiting lysosomes with leupeptin restored the protein amounts of lysozyme in crypt organoids derived from GF mice as determined byimmunostaining and immunoblotting(Supplementary Fig.4e,f), which suggests that lysozyme is degraded in lysosomes in Paneth cells in GF mice.Because these observations were similar to the degradation of lysozyme in lysosomes in the $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells,we examined the cellularlocalization ofLRRK2,Rab2aandRab10 in Paneth cells from GF mice.LRRK2 and Rab2a proteins were almost completely absent from more mature,apical DCVs in Paneth cells in GF mice compared with those in SPF mice (Fig. $\mathbf { 5 e - g }$ and Supplementary Fig.5a,b).However,quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA and immunoblotting analysis of protein showed that amounts of LRRK2 and Rab2a mRNA and protein were not reduced in isolated crypts from GF mice compared with crypts from SPF mice (Supplementary Fig.5c,d),which suggested that the loss of lysozyme in GF mice was due not to the loss of expression of LRRK2 and Rab2a but to the lack of DCVlocalization of LRRK2 and Rab2a.Furthermore,immunostaining and whole-mount staining showed that lysozyme sorting and secretion were restored in conventionalized GF mice compared with GF mice (Fig.5a,c),which suggested that the presence of symbiotic bacteria was required to directlysozyme sorting during DCV maturation.In addition,conventionalization of GF mice restored the cellular localization oflysozyme,LRRK2 and Rab2ain Paneth cells compared with that in GF mice (Fig.5e,f),which indicated that the presence of commensals is required for lysozyme sorting.

# Nod2 senses commensal bacteria to direct lysozyme sorting

Plasma membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs)and the cytoplasmic receptor Nod2 have been reported to sense bacterial products in Paneth cells6,17.To determine which of these is responsible for commensal-directed lysozyme sorting,we examined lysozyme distribution in Paneth cells from $M y d 8 8 ^ { - / - }$ mice (Myd88 encodes a downstream adaptor of TLRs) and $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice.Approximately $78 \%$ of DCVs in $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells were devoid of lysozyme,compared with approximately $1 8 \%$ in wild-type Paneth cells (Fig.6a,b),whereas the lysozyme distribution was normal in $M y d 8 8 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells (Fig.6a). Because the loss of lysozyme in Paneth cell DCVs in $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice might have been influenced by genetic background and intestinal microbiota composition34,we used siRNA to silence Nod2 in cultured organoids.Immunostaining showed a marked decrease in amounts of lysozyme protein in cultured organoids transfected with a Nod2- specific siRNA oligo compared with organoids transfected with control siRNA(Supplementary Fig.6a,b).Previous studies using colorimetric immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed normal lysozyme staining in $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells34.We also found similar lysozyme staining between wild-type and $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells by colorimetric IHC (Supplementary Fig.6c).We suggest that because of the nature of the colorimetric reactions,chromogen-based IHC is not suitable for studying a gradual cellular process such as cargo sorting. Whole-mount staining showed deficient lysozyme expression in the intestinal lumens of $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 6c). $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice were more susceptible to intestinal Listeria infection even after being housed with wild-type mice for2 weeks (Supplementary Fig.6d),which indicated an effect independent of intestinal microbiota.Furthermore,immunostaining showed that lysosome inhibition by leupeptin treatment restored lysozyme in cultured $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells compared with amounts in mocktreated cells (Supplementary Fig.6e,f).Thus,Nod2 is required for the sorting of lysozyme into DCVs,and Nod2 deficiency leads to lysosomal degradation of lysozyme.

In SPF wild-type mice,Nod2 was localized on the surface of DCVs (Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Fig. ${ \bf 6 g , h }$ ),consistentwitha previous study of human Paneth cells35.Immunoblotting also detected the expression of Nod2 in sorted $\mathrm { C D } 2 4 ^ { + }$ Paneth cells (Supplementary Fig.6i).Nod2 could not be detected on the surface of DCVs in GF mice (Fig.6d,e),but its localization was restored in conventionalized GF mice (Fig.6d),which indicated that the presence of commensals was necessary for Nod2 to localize to DCVs in Paneth cells.We next examined the localization of LRRK2 and Rab2a in $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells.Similar to our observations in Paneth cells from GF mice, theDCVlocalization of Rab2 andLRRK2 in $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells was greatly reduced compared with that in wild-type Paneth cells (Fig.6f-h).Coimmunoprecipitation revealed interaction between LRRK2 and Nod2 when overexpressed in HEK293T cells and between the endogenous proteins in isolated crypts (Fig.6i-k).Thus,Nod2 on DCVs might physically recruit LRRK2 for lysozyme sorting. These results indicate that Nod2 mediates the microbial signal to direct cargo sorting in DCVs.

# Bacterial ligands restore lysozyme sorting

Next we asked whether binding of Nod2 by its ligands is suficient for lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells from GF mice.We first treated cultured organoids derived from GF mice with the Nod2 cognate ligand MDP,a bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan.This treatment restored lysozyme staining in GF-derived Paneth cells in cultured organoids (Fig.7a). Treatment of GF mice with MDP via oral gavage restored lysozyme staining in mature DCVs in Paneth cells compared with DCVs from mock-treated GF mice (Fig. 7b,c). This treatment also restored lysozyme in the intestinal lumens of GF mice in comparison with those of mock-treated GF mice,as detected by whole-mount staining against lysozyme (Fig.7d),whereas procryptdin was unaffected (Fig.7e).To determine whether other bacterial ligands might also restore lysozyme in GF mice,we treated cultured organoids derived from GF mice with a range of Nodl and TLR agonists.In addition to MDP,lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment also restored lysozyme in vitro and in vivo (SupplementaryFig.7a-c). Lysozyme staining was similar between wild-type and $T l r { 4 ^ { - / - } }$ crypts, used as a control (Supplementary Fig.7d),which suggested that TLR4 signaling is not involved in lysozyme sorting.In contrast, LPS treatment in GF mice restored the DCV localization of LRRK2 and Rab2a,but not Nod2 (Supplementary Fig.7e-g),which indicated that LPS may engage in crosstalk with LRRK2 and Rab2a through some unknown mechanism(s).Thus,specific commensal bacterial ligands are sufficient for directing lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells in germ-free conditions.Our genetic and functional analyses demonstrate that symbiotic bacteria direct lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells through a molecular pathway including Nod2,LRRK2 and Rab2a (Supplementary Fig.8).

# DISCUSSION

Here we have described a specific lysozyme defect in $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells and used small intestinal crypt organoid cultures to investigate the molecular basis of this defect.Biochemical analysis showed that $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ Paneth cells lacked lysozyme because of a post-translational defect.Yeast two-hybrid screeningidentified Rab2a,which regulates DCV cargo trafficking in C.elegans25,as a binding partner ofLRRK2. Knockdown in crypt organoids indicated that Rab2a was required for lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells.Thus,our study describes a conserved Rab2a-dependent sorting-by-retention mechanism in mammalian cells and suggests that LRRK2 is required for the DCV localization ofRab2ain Paneth cells.

The presence of commensal microbes was required for lysozyme sorting promoting the DCV localization of Nod2.Consistent with this,bacterial ligands restored lysozyme sorting in Paneth cells in GF mice.It was previously reported that commensals promote DCV secretion26.Notably, in DCV-mediated exocytosis,selective cargo sorting occurs at a stage that precedes the final secretion step. Thus, two different steps,selective cargo sorting and final secretion, are separately regulated by commensals.

Our study shows that Nod2 and LRRK2 regulated the selective sorting of lysozyme,but not other proteins such as Reg3y and procryptdin,by recruiting Rab2a onto the DCV surface.How Rab2a controls such selective sorting remains to be explored.In fact,little is known about how specific DCV protein cargos are successully sorted inside DCVs while others are directed to the endosomal-lysosomal route during DCV maturation. Cargo receptors or chaperones may exist either in the lumen or on the DCV surface29.Members of the Rab family of small GTPase proteins are regulators of intracellular vesicle trafficking and havea key rolein controlling the cellular fate of membrane receptors36,37.Therefore,a possible scenario is that Rab2a controls the cellular fate of certain cargo receptors on DCVs.Loss of Rab2a may cause the receptors,and consequently lysozyme, to be sent to lysosomes for degradation.Other cargos,such as Reg3y and procryptdin,may have different receptors and therefore be unaffected by the loss of Rab2a from the surface ofDCVs.

At the junction of commensals and mucosal immunity, Paneth cells havea key role in intestinal homeostasis.Abnormalities in vesicle traffickingin Paneth cells,characterized bydiminished amounts of lysozyme-positive DCVs,have been noted in people with Crohn's disease24,38. Notably, in Paneth cells with defects in autophagy genes, intracellular vesicle trafficking is impaired,as shown bya diffuse lysozyme staining pattern and decreased secretion of lysozyme24,39. Such defects are dependent on persistent intestinal infection with murine norovirus40.The defects we observed in Paneth cells from $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ 0 $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ and GF mice were different.First,the defects did not depend on norovirus infection,which was constantly monitored in our animal facility. Second,instead of displayinga diffuse staining pattern in autophagy-gene-defective Paneth cells,the lysozyme content was selectively and progressivelydiminished in more mature apical DCVs in Paneth cells from $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ and GF mice, which indicated a cargo-sorting defect during DCV maturation. Despite these minor differences in mechanism,studies by us and others clearly highlight the role of dysregulated membrane traficking in Paneth cells in IBD pathogenesis.

In our study, MDP and LPS,but not other tested agonists,promoted lysozyme sorting in GF mice,which suggests a relatively specific requirement for bacterial ligands in the lysozyme-sorting process.Other factors,such as autophagy,may also affect lysozyme sorting,but this remains to be explored.LRRK2 is involved in the endosomal-autophagic pathway41,and Nod2, IRGM and ATG16L1 form a protein complex to modulate autophagosome formation42-44. Autophagyis not required for lysozyme trafficking under steady-state conditions40. However, whether autophagy regulates lysozyme sorting under stress conditions,such as infection or starvation,remains to be determined.It will be interesting to determine whether other factors,such as autophagy,crosstalk with Nod2 and LRRK2 to modulate lysozyme sorting.

Our data showed that LRRK2 participates in cargo sorting by recruiting Rab2a onto DCVs.A few members of the Rab small GTPase family have been found to associate with LRRK2,including Rab5b,Rab7L1 and Rab32(refs.45-47).Therefore,itis likely that LRRK2 regulates intracellular membrane trafficking in a cell-contextdependent manner. DCVs in neurons are responsible for the storage and secretion of important neurotropic factors.As a step toward clarifying the genetic involvement of LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease,it would be worthwhile to examine whetherLRRK2 similarly regulates Rab2ain neurons.

In summary,our study unravels a new mechanism by which symbiotic bacteria direct a cargo-sorting event to promote host defense against pathogens. Our study also provides an example of how molecular studies on IBD-susceptibility genes can provide insights into the complex nature of the reciprocal regulation between host and microbial organisms.

Statistical analysis.Statistical analyses were done with assistance from GraphPad Prism software.The results are expressed as the mean and s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated.

Mice. $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ and $M y d 8 8 ^ { - / - }$ mice on a C57BL/6J background were from Jax. $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice (RIKEN),which have been described previously48,were originally ona C57BL/6J congenic background and were backcrossed with wild-type C57BL/6J mice for two more generations after arriving in our facility. All SPF mice,including wild-type C57BL/J6,were bred and housed in a barrierfacilityaccredited by the Association for AssessmentandAccreditation ofLaboratory Animal Care International for SPF mice (Laboratory Animal Facility of Tsinghua University).The facility was routinelychecked for the absence of specific infectious agents,including murine novovirus and Helicobacter.All procedures were done with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of Tsinghua University.

GF C57BL/6J mice were maintained in GF conditions in vinyl isolators in the animal facility in Third Military Medical University and were used according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Third MilitaryMedical University.Mice were euthanized immediately after being taken out of the isolators.

Cell culture and reagents.HEK293T cells (CRL-3216,ATCC) were verified with tests recommended by ATCC,including a morphology check by microscopy and growth curve analysis.The cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination by Hoechst 33258 staining as recommended by ATCC and were found to be free of contamination.The cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with $1 0 \%$ FBS (Hyclone)and $1 \%$ Pen-Strep (Invitrogen） in a $5 \%$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ atmosphere.All chemical reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise mentioned.Ultrapure LPS,Pam3CSK4,iE-DAP,and poly(dA:dT) were from Invivogen.

Antibodies.The following primary antibodies were used:anti-LRRK2 (Epitomics,MJFF2 c41-2),anti-lysozyme (Abcam,ab36362),anti-Rab2a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-28567),anti-Rab10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-6564),anti-Reg3y (Abgent,AP5606c),anti-Myc (Roche,clone 9E10, 11667149001),anti-GFP (Roche,11814460001),anti-Nod2 (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-30199),and anti-actin (Sigma,AC15,A5441).A rabbit antibody to procryptdin was generated as described49.The prosegment (DPIQNTDEETKTEEQPGEDDQAVSVSFGDP EGTSLQEES),which is conserved in all mouse procryptdin,was conjugated to KLH and used to immunize rabbits in complete Freund's adjuvant.Immunization was boosted twice,and the antiserum titer was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Anti-procryptdin was further purified ona ProteinA-agarose column (Sigma).Some of the rabbit anti-procryptdin was further conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 with a conjugation kit (Invitrogen,A20187) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol.Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were all from Invitrogen.

Plasmids.pCMV-2xMyc-LRRK2 wasa kind gift from Dr.M.Cookson (National Institutes of Health).The human Nod2 cDNA was cloned into the pEGFP vector from a human Nod2-expressing plasmid that was a kind gift from Dr.T.Kufer(Universität Hohenheim).Human and mouse Rab2a cDNA were reverse-transcribed from mRNA prepared from HEK293T cells and mouse brain,respectively,and cloned into the pEGFP vector. Sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Bacterial infection. Sex-and age-matched (6-8 weeks old) wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ littermates were used for all the infection experiments,which were performed under BL2 conditions.Sex-and age-matched(6-8 weeks old) wildtype and $N o d 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice were housed together 2 weeks before infection.For intestinal infection experiments,mice were infected by gastric gavage with $1 0 ^ { 9 } L$ monocytogenes strain l0403s per mouse.Bacterial burden, measured in CFU,was assayed as described20.Feces were collected under sterile conditions $^ { 1 0 \mathrm { h } }$ after infection,and bacterial burden was determined as CFU per gram dry weight.Spleen and liver tissues were collected under sterile conditions after mice were euthanized $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ after infection,and bacterial burden was determined as CFU per organ.For systemic infection,mice were infected with $1 0 ^ { 4 } L$ monocytogenes per mouse by intravenous tail vein injection.Mice were euthanized $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ and $4 8 \mathrm { h }$ afterinfection.Bacterial burden in spleen and liver tissues was measured as described above.

Recombinant lysozyme supplementation.Sex- and age-matched (6-8 weeks old）wild-type and $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ littermates received $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / k g } }$ recombinant lysozyme (Sigma,Ll667) or PBS by gastric gavage every $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ for 7 consecutive days. $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ after the final treatment,mice were infected with $1 0 ^ { 9 } L$ monocytogenes bygastric gavage.Bacterial burden was measured as described above.

Microbiota DNA extraction and analysis.DNA from intestinal microbiota was isolated with the Qiagen stool isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.DNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop,and molecular size was estimated byagarose gel electrophoresis. Universal primers 338F and 806R were used for PCR amplification of the V3-V4hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes (338F $5 ^ { \prime }$ -ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA $3 ^ { \prime }$ $8 0 6 \mathrm { R }$ $5 ^ { \prime }$ -GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3') and contained Illumina $3 ^ { \prime }$ adaptor sequences as well as a l2-bp barcode.Sequencing was done on an Illumina MiSeq PE30o.A total of 504,002 sequences were included in the study. The average number of sequences per specimen was 31,5oo,with a minimum of 22,773 and a maximum of 39,647. The average sequence length was 432 bases.Raw sequencing reads were de-noised,filtered according to barcode and primer sequences,and classified with Mothur.Chimeric sequences identified byMothur and nonreplicated sequences were removed.The high-quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by Mothur.The OTUs that reached a nucleotide-similaritylevel of $9 7 \%$ were used foralpha diversity (Shannon),richness (ACE and Chaol),Good's coverage,and rarefaction curve analysis with Mothur.Phylogenetic beta diversity measures such as unweighted UniFrac distance metrics analysis and principal-component analysis were done with OTUs for each sample with the Mothur program.

For taxonomy-based analyses,we determined a representative sequence for each OTU by selecting the most abundant sequences in that OTU.These representative sequences were classified and assigned to a taxonomic string with theRibosomalDatabase Project Classifier

Fecal microbiota transplantation.For bacterial-transplantation experiments, fecal microbiota from wild-type or $L r r k 2 ^ { - / - }$ mice housed in separate cages were administered to 8-week-old GF wild-type mice by gastric gavage.Recipient mice were housed in separate isolators and euthanized or orally infected with Listeria as described above at day14 after transplantation.Cecum contents from the conventionalized GF mice were collected for microbiota analysis to confirm the bacterial colonization.

In vivo MDP and LPS treatment in GF mice.GF mice in vinyl isolators received MDP $( 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m o u s e } )$ in $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ endotoxin-free PBS,LPS $5 0 0 \mu \mathrm { g / }$ mouse) in $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ endotoxin-free PBS,or PBS (mock treatment) twice by mouth,with treatments $1 2 \mathrm { h }$ apart.Four hours after the second treatment, mice were killed and intestinal tissues were processed as described above.

Intestinal organoid culture.Intestinal organoids were cultured according to a published method,with minor changes in crypt isolation27,50.After fat and connective tissues had been removed,a 5-cm-long section of distal ileum was opened longitudinally and rinsed with cold PBS.The tissue was then washed vigorously in $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ cold PBS in a $5 0 \mathrm { - m l }$ tube for 1 min and rinsed again in cold PBS.The tissue was then chopped into pieces smaller than $3 { - } 4 \mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ and incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ with $2 \bmod { 0 . 1 \% }$ collagenase solution.Tissue sections were pipetted up and down every $7 \mathrm { m i n }$ during the incubation.Tissue sections were then transferred to another $2 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of fresh collagenase solution for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ,during which the digestion reaction was pipetted up and down every $7 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ and monitored for the release of crypts. Digestion was stopped by dilution with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ cold PBS when around $7 0 \%$ of the crypts had been released,and the digests were filtered through a $7 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ cell strainer.The released crypts were pelleted by centrifugation at $1 0 0 g$ for $5 \mathrm { m i n }$ .Pelleted crypts $( \sim 5 0 0 )$ were then mixed with $5 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ Matrigel (Invitrogen) and plated on glass coverslips ( $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ in diameter) in 24-well plates.After Matrigel polymerization, $5 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ growth medium was added to each well.

Growth medium was changed every 3or $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 4 d }$ Everyweek,organoidswere retrieved from the Matrigel,mechanically dissociated,and plated into fresh Matrigel. Culture medium contained Advanced DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with L-glutamine (Invitrogen), $1 \%$ Pen-Strep (Invitrogen), $1 0 \mu \mathrm { M }$ Hepes (Invitrogen),N2 supplement 1:1oo (Invitrogen),B27 supplement 1:50 (Invitrogen), $5 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ epidermal growth factor (Peprotech), $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ R-spondin 1(R&D Systems), $1 0 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ Noggin (R&D Systems),and $1 0 \mathrm { n g / m l }$ Wnt-3a (Peprotech).

Isolation of $\mathbf { C D 2 4 ^ { + } }$ Panethcells.Crypts from small intestine were isolated as described above.Isolated crypts were digested into single-cell suspension by 30 min of incubation at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in TrypLE Express supplemented with $2 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { U / m l }$ DNase I. Single cells were incubated on ice for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ with $_ \mathrm { P e r C P - C y } 5 . 5 -$ conjugated anti-CD24(Ebiosciences,45-0242-80) in PBS with $2 \%$ FBS,washed three times with PBS with $2 \%$ FBS,and subsequently sorted on an AriaIII. Both $\mathrm { C D } 2 4 ^ { - }$ and $\mathrm { C D } 2 4 ^ { + }$ cells were collected and used for immunoblotting analysis.Lysozyme staining was done after cells had been stained with CD24, fixed with $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde (PFA) for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,and treated with $1 \times$ permeabilization buffer (Ebiosciences,00-8333-56) for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ . Cells were then incubated with anti-lysozyme and subsequently with allophycocyaninconjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G2a (Ebiosciences,17-4210-80) and analyzed ona FACScalibur.

L $6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ in thickness) were mounted on positively charged glass and dewaxed. Antigen retrieval was achieved by incubation in $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { M }$ sodium citrate buffer $\left( \mathrm { p H } 6 . 0 \right)$ for $2 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ in a boiling steamer. Slides were then blocked with PBS supplemented with normal goat serum blocking reagent (Wuhan Boster, China) for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and subjected to sequential incubation with primary antibodies at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ .Whenapplicable,slides were further incubated with fluorophore-conjugated anti-procryptdin at $4 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight.Between each incubation step,slides were washed with PBS three times for $5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ $1 0 \%$ goat serum was present throughout all antibody incubation steps.Slides were then counterstained with ToPro3 and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech).Confocal images were obtained with an Olympus TM FluoView 1200 or Zeiss LSM710 imaging system under a $6 3 \times$ oil-immersion objective.For direct comparisons between wild-type and different knockout mice or between mock-treated and treated mice,we performed the whole procedure side by side for the relevant mice from the point of tissue harvesting.

Image-based quantification of positively stained DCVs.Quantification ofDCVs was done bya blinded investigator.DCVs in 30 Paneth cells from each animal were quantified for positive staining for the specified proteins. Data were averaged and plotted with GraphPad Prism software.The RGB tool in Image Jwas used for categorization of lysozyme-containing DCVs in GF and SPF mice.

Immunofluorescence staining of cultured organoids.Organoids grown on glass coverslips were washed once with ice-cold PBS and fixed with ice-cold $4 \%$ PFA in PBS for $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ .Organoids on coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and blocked with antibody dilution buffer(PBS supplemented with $1 0 \%$ goat serum and $0 . 1 \%$ saponin）for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .Organoids on coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight and then with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ Samples were washed in PBS containing $0 . 1 \%$ Tween-20 three times for each step.Antibody dilution buffer was used throughout for antibody incubation steps.Coverslips were then counterstained and mounted on slides in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech).Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 710 imaging system under a $6 3 \times$ oil-immersion objective.For imaging comparisons between organoids that had undergone various treatments, samples were processed side by side for the whole procedure.

Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining.Ileal sections were opened longitudinally after the adipose tissues had been stripped off.Tissues were fixed in $4 \%$ PFA for1h before being rinsed three times for $5 \mathrm { m i n }$ in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ at room temperature.After PBS washes,tissues were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled $H$ pomatia lectin (Invitrogen,L1l271) for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ at room temperature.Tissues were mounted on glass slides and examined under a Nikon Eclipse 90i or Ti-s automated fluorescence microscope with a $1 0 \times$ objective.

Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections.Tissue slices ( $6 \mu \mathrm { m }$ in thickness) fromPFA-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were mounted on positively charged glass and dewaxed.We retrieved antigen by boiling the slides in $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ sodium citrate buffer $\left( \mathrm { p H } 6 . 0 \right)$ for $2 5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The slideswere washed with PBS,afterwhich IHC was done with an UltraSensitive TM S-P Kit (Maixin Bio,China).The slides were first treated with hydrogen peroxide for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ to block endogenous peroxidase and then incubated with a blocking serum for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at room temperature.The slides were then sequentially incubated with mouse anti-lysozyme overnight at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ biotinylated secondary goat anti-mouse for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at room temperature,and streptavidin-peroxidase foranother $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at room temperature.Between each incubation step,slides were washed with PBS three times for $5 \mathrm { m i n }$ .Immunoreactivity was detected with diaminobenzidine.The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted,and observed with a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse 90i).

Yeast two-hybrid screening.Yeast two-hybrid screening was done according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Clontech).LRRK2 was cloned into pGBKT7 and transformed into yeast AH1o9.A mouse 7.5-d embryo library in pACT2 was screened for potential interacting partners in the yeast strain Y187. After the two yeast strains had been mated,zygotic cells were plated on quadruple dropout medium (QDO)-X-α-galactosidase to select for putative positive two-hybrid interactions for further analysis.The pACT2AD plasmids of the selected colonies were recovered in E.coli and identified by sequencing. In order to confirm the protein-protein interactions of interest,we transformed the target plasmid combinations into yeast AHlo9 and confirmed on QDO-X $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { d } $ -galactosidase plates.

Immunoprecipitation. $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ transfected HEK293T cells or $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ isolated crypts were collected,washed with $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ cold PBS,and lysed in $4 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ cold immunoprecipitation buffer ( $\mathrm { ~ \ ~ } 5 0 \mathrm { ~ m M }$ Tris, $1 5 0 \mathrm { \ m M \ N a C l }$ ， $2 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ EDTA, $1 \%$ NP-40, $0 . 5 \mathrm { m M }$ PMSF,protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche) on ice for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .Cell nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at $1 0 , 0 0 0 g$ for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .10 ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf \vec { \mu } } |$ samples of supernatants were saved for input.The rest of the supernatants were precleared with $1 5 \mu \mathrm { l }$ protein G-conjugated DYNAbeads (Invitrogen) for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Immunoprecipitation antibody $( 1 - 2 \mu \mathrm { g } )$ was added to supernatants for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before $1 5 \mu \mathrm { l }$ DYNAbeads were added to pull down protein-antibody complexes for1h.The antibody complexbound to DYNAbeads was washed three times with $4 0 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ immunoprecipitation buffer before being eluted with $3 0 \mu \mathrm { l }$ SDS sample buffer $( 1 \times )$ .Both inputs and eluents underwent immunoblotting analysis.
