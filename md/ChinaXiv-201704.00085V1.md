An improved concentration of phosphorescent dopant for highly-efficient hybrid white organic lightemitting diodes based on a high radiative exciton ratio $( 8 0 \% )$ deep-blue emitter has been developed.The highradiative exciton ratio for the deep-blue emitter wasfoundto be the transfer from the higher triplet $( \mathsf { T } _ { 5 } )$ to the lowest singlet state $( \mathsf { S } _ { 1 } )$ by a “hot-exciton" process.Notably,when the concentration of Ir(2- $\mathsf { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ is up to $0 . 9 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,the OLED still exhibited white emission with a maximum total EQE,CE and PE of $2 2 . 3 \%$ 53.7 cd $\mathsf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $6 0 . 2 ~ \mathsf { l m } ~ \mathsf { W } ^ { - 1 } .$ ：respectively.The exciton transfer mechanism in a high concentration of phosphorescent dopant was also discussed.The studies provide a way to obtain high performance F/P hybrid WOLEDs with a simple architecture and improved doping concentration.

# 1.Introduction

White organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs） have been attracting great attention due to their favorable properties of good color rendering,flexibility,and homogenous large-area emission for lighting sources and full color OLEDs.1-4 In the past two decades,some effective approaches have been used to achieve WOLEDs including full fluorescent,’ phosphorescent6 and hybrid WOLEDs. Generally，for the full fluorescent WOLEDs,they have been demonstrated with excellent stability. However, these devices show low efficiencies owing to the limit of exciton statistics.' So,in order to obtain high efficiencies, the researchers begin to focus on the full phosphorescent WOLEDs, which have been reported with high efficiencies up to $1 0 0 \%$ internal quantum efficiency.Unfortunately,these devices are not stable enough to ensure a long device life-time as the limit of the availability of high performance blue hosts/emitters.9 Moreover,an intrinsic exchange energy loss arising from energy transfer from the host's singlets to the phosphorescent guest's triplets cannotbe prevented fully.In view of this,the develop ment of fluorescence (F) and phosphorescence (P) hybrid

WOLEDs is considered to be an ideal solution to approach highefficiency and long life-time WOLEDs.

Commonly, the hybrid WOLEDs can be constructed using two architectures，including multi-emissive-layers(multiEML),ora single-emissive-layer (single-EML） with different color emitting dopants. The multi-EML structure usually requires complexity of device fabrication with an interlayer between the fluorophore and phosphor to prevent mutual exciton transfer and quenching processes,which decrease the reproducibility and raise the fabrication cost.Furthermore, the complicated multilayer structure is also difficult to be achieved by solution processing.Compared to the multi-EML counterpart,the single-EML can be avoided effectively the accumulation of charges and the generation of a higher electric field at the interfaces,especially for the single-dopant single-EML WOLEDs.Therefore，the single-dopant singleEML structure is thought to be a potential strategy to fabricatehybrid WOLEDswith high efficiencies.

In the early work,Leo et al. demonstrated one kind of singledopant single-EML $\mathbf { F } / \mathbf { P }$ hybrid WOLEDs by doping a yellow phosphor $( \mathrm { I r } ( \mathrm { M D Q } ) _ { 2 } ( \mathrm { a c a c } ) )$ into a blue fluorescent host (4P-NPD).10 Their exhibited external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) ata practical brightness of 1000 cd $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ are much lower than the theoretically maximum EQE $\mathrm { ( E Q E _ { \mathrm { { m a x } } } ) }$ of $2 0 \%$ ,which can be attributed to the unipolar of 4P-NPD.And the corresponding power efficiencies are not yet high enough for practical applications.In the meantime Ma et al.reported one of bipolar derivatives containing triphenylamine and oxadiazole units for single-dopant single-EML WOLEDs.11 A maximum current efficiency (CE) of 7.9 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ (a corresponding EQE of $5 . 2 \%$ )wasachieved.Mostrecently,higher performance with maximum total EQE of $2 6 . 6 \%$ ，total efficiencies of 53.5 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $6 7 . 2 \ln \mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }$ has been obtained by Zhang's group based on a blue fluorophor (DADBT) and orange phosphors $\left( \operatorname { I r } ( 2 { \cdot } \operatorname { p h q } ) _ { 3 } \right)$ hybrid single-dopant singleEML.1² Nevertheless, the dopant concentration of phosphors in these WOLEDs with single-dopant single-EML structure was very low $\left( 0 . 1 \% \right)$ ,which was difficult to be controlled by vacuum deposition. Moreover，the color was very sensitive to the dopant concentration of phosphors.A small variation in the dopant concentration would result in a pronounced change in the energy transfer between the emitting dopants.Therefore, developments of improving dopant concentration design strategies for flexible manipulation have been considered as the current key challenges for progressing single-dopant single-EML $\mathbf { F } / \mathbf { P }$ hybrid WOLEDs.

In this work,we demonstrated the first time with improved dopant concentration by design and synthesis of an ideal saturated deep-bluefluorophor， N,N-diphenyl- $4 ^ { \prime \prime }$ (1,4,5-triphenyl- $1 H \cdot$ -imidazol-2-yl) $\cdot [ 1 , 1 ^ { \prime } { : } 4 ^ { \prime } , 1 ^ { \prime \prime }$ -terphenyl]-4-amine (DPTPA), which exhibits high radiative exciton ratio and deep-blue emission.The single-dopant single-EML $\mathbf { F } / \mathbf { P }$ hybrid WOLED has been fabricated with improved dopant concentration to $0 . 9 \%$ ,which dose not follow the conventional principle of the doping concentration regulation.The device still shows white emission and excellent electroluminescence (EL) performance with a low turn-on voltage of $2 . 6 \mathrm { V }$ ,maximum total EQE,CE and PE of $2 2 . 3 \%$ ,53.7 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $6 0 . 2 \mathrm { ~ l m ~ W ^ { - 1 } }$ ,respectively.

# 2. Results and discussion

# 2.1Synthesis and crystal structure

For the synthesis of DPTPA (Fig.1),the important intermediate was $4 ^ { \prime \prime }$ -(diphenyl-amino) $_ { \cdot \lbrack { 1 , 1 ^ { \prime } : 4 ^ { \prime } , 1 ^ { \prime \prime } } }$ -terphenyl]-4-carbaldehyde (3),which was synthesized by Suzuki couplings of $4 ^ { \prime }$ -bromo $^ { N , N }$ diphenyl- $[ 1 , 1 ^ { \prime }$ -biphenyl]-4-amine (2) and (4-formyl-phenyl) boronic acid using $\mathrm { P d } ( \mathrm { P P h } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } \mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ as catalysis. While the compound 2 can be prepared by mixing (4-(diphenylamino) phenyl)boronic acid (1)and 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene in the presence of $\mathrm { P d } ( \mathrm { P P h } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } \mathrm { C l } _ { 2 } .$ ， $\mathbf { K } _ { 2 } \mathbf { C O } _ { 3 }$ and toluene.Finally，the condensation of compound 3 and benzil resulted in the target compound DPTPA with high yield.Single-crystal of DPTPA†was obtained from a layering of ethanol onto a mixed solution of dichloromethane and $n$ -hexane.As shown in the crystal structure,the highly twisted geometry is found in the DPTPA to contain $N \mathrm { . }$ -substituted benzene ring with imidazole plane and triphenylamine (TPA) moiety in DPTPA with the imidazole plane,and the dihedral angles are $9 7 . 6 ^ { \circ }$ and $2 3 . 3 ^ { \circ }$ ,respectively.

# 2.2Electrochemical and thermal and properties

The electrochemical behavior of DPTPA was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV).The HOMO level ofDPTPA was determined from the onset potential of the first oxidation relative to ferro cene (Fig. 2a),and the LUMO level was calculated by adding the optical band gap to the HOMO levels.The results are summarizedin Table1.The first oxidation eventis observedat O.86 (vs. $\mathrm { F c / F c ^ { + } } )$ .The potentials can be translated to HOMO level of $5 . 2 6 \ \mathrm { e V }$ ，The thermal properties of DPTPA were investigated with TGA and DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere as shown in Fig.2b,and their thermal dataare summarized in Table1.The TGA measurement shows that DPTPA possesses high thermal stabilities of more than $4 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 、Aweight loss of $5 \%$ $\left( T _ { \mathrm { d } } \right)$ is observed at $4 6 9 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 、The value is more than $1 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ above the sublimation temperatures and therefore proves the high thermal stability.The DSC curve shows the glass-transition temperatures $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \right)$ is found to be $1 5 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ：

# 2.3 Theoretical calculation

The geometry and electronic structures of DPTPA were obtained using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the Gaussian O3 program.13 The calculated dihedral angles between imidazole and $N \cdot$ substituted benzene ring and triphenylamine moieties are $8 7 . 8 ^ { \circ }$ and $4 1 . 5 ^ { \circ }$ ,respectively. The large twisted geometry configuration might prevent intramolecular extending of $\pi$ -electron and suppress molecular packing in the solid state effectively,which is agreement with the results of the crystal structure.The electron dentistry of DPTPA was shown in Fig. 3. The HOMO orbit of DPTPA mainly populate on the whole molecule,while the corresponding LUMO orbit mainly locate on the linkerand imidazole moieties. A large overlapping was found in the molecule,which would be benefit to balance the carriers.The values of HOMO and LUMO levels are $4 . 9 \ \mathrm { e V }$ and $2 . 2 4 \ \mathrm { ~ e V }$ ，respectively.In contrast，the absolute values of the frontier orbital energies have a $0 . 3 6 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical data.As DFT-calculations were performed in gas-phase only，solvent effects occurring during experimental characterization were not taken into account.Additionally，time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations were used to predict the lowest and higher exited states (triplets and singlets),two degenerate triplet levels $\left( \mathbf { T } _ { 3 } \right.$ and $\bf { T _ { 4 } }$ of $3 . 0 0 7 \mathrm { e V }$ ,which is lower than the value of the $\mathbf { S _ { 1 } }$ level $\left( 3 . 2 6 7 ~ \mathrm { e V } \right)$ .And the lower triplet states ( $\mathrm { \tilde { T } _ { 1 } }$ and ${ \bf T } _ { 2 } ^ { \phantom { \dagger } }$ are $2 . 6 1 4 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ and $2 . 8 4 8 \ \mathrm { \ e V }$ ，respectively.All of these low triplet states are ascribed to the transition from HOMO-1 to LUMO and from HOMO-2 to LUMO $+ 1$ ,both located on the same imidazole unit. The transitions between spatially non-overlapped HOMO-2 and LUMO orbitals are ascribed to $\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ and $\mathrm { T } _ { 5 }$ ,and their energy difference is zero. HOMO-2 and $\mathbf { L U M O } { + } 2$ also do not overlap, and the transitions between them are ascribed to $\mathbf { S } _ { 2 }$ and ${ \bf T } _ { 9 } \mathrm { { ; } }$ their energy difference is also zero.These zero gaps between the exited singlet $( S _ { \mathrm { n } } \geq 1 \big )$ andtriplet $\mathrm { \Delta } T _ { \mathrm { m } } \geq 3 ]$ state may offer some advantage with respect to increasing the radiative singlet-state population from the nonradiative high triplet state,generated by the “hot-exciton”process from the $\mathrm { T } _ { 5 }$ to $\mathbf { S _ { 1 } }$ states.

# 2.4Absorption and photoluminescent properties

The absorption and photoluminescent (PL) spectra in film and solution are shown in Fig.4.The absorption spectra in solution and filmare nearly identical,implying small dipolar changesat the ground state in different surroundings.The absorptive spectra is characterized by an absorption maximum at $\lambda _ { \mathrm { m a x , a b s } }$ $= 3 5 1 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ,while the onsetisdetermined at $\lambda = 3 9 7 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ .Itcan be attributed to be the transition of $\pi \ \to \ \pi ^ { * }$ .14 Weaker absorption band is observed at $\lambda = 3 0 5 \mathrm { n m }$ ,which is assigned to be the transition of $\delta \to \pi$ .15Asmall bathochromic shift occurs in the solid state.The PL spectra in solution features the similar profiles with that of in film.The peak is located at ${ \sim } 4 3 5 \mathrm { n m }$ and the FWHM of $5 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ in solution and $4 6 \mathrm { n m }$ in film, respectively. Moreover，the compound of DPTPA exhibits a pronounced

The electroluminescent (EL） spectra，current densityvoltage-luminance $\left( J - V - L \right)$ characteristics，and CE-current density-PE plots of the device based on DPTPA are shown in Fig.6,and the key performance parameters of the device are summarized in Table 2.The device shows a saturated deepblue emission solely from DPTPA (peaked at $4 3 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ）and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.15,0.09).The EL spectra show little changes as the brightness increases from 10 to $1 0 \ 0 0 0 \ c d \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ .Furthermore,a low turn-on voltages (voltage required to give 1 cd $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ )of $2 . 8 \mathrm { V }$ was observed.The low turn-on voltages are mainly attributed to charge injection and balanced charge recombination in the emitter layer.For the EL efficiencies，the device exhibits impressive maximum EQE,CE and PE of $3 . 8 1 \%$ ，3.45 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $3 . 5 2 \ln \mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively,and these effciencies remain to be $3 . 7 8 \%$ ，3.43 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $3 . 1 2 \ \mathrm { l m } \ \mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }$ at a brightness of 100 cd $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，even at the brightness of 1000 cd $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，these efficiencies still remain to be $3 . 4 0 \%$ ，3.07 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $1 . 8 8 \ \mathrm { l m } \ \mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }$ . Considering the low fluorescent quantum yield $\left( 2 3 . 8 \% \right)$ and high device external quantum effciency $\left( 3 . 8 1 \% \right)$ ， the performances are among the best for saturated deep-blue fluorescent OLEDs.2o The corresponding theoretical value of the radiative exciton ratio was calculated by the following equation: $\eta _ { \mathrm { e x t } } = \gamma \eta _ { \mathrm { r } } \eta _ { \mathrm { P L } } \eta _ { \mathrm { o u t } } ,$ in which $\eta _ { \mathrm { r } }$ is the radiative exciton ratio, $\eta _ { \mathrm { e x t } }$ is the external quantum efficiency, $\eta _ { \mathrm { o u t } }$ is the light out-coupling efficiency $( c a . \ 2 0 \% )$ ， $\eta _ { \mathrm { P L } }$ is the intrinsic photoluminescence efficiency $( c a . \ 2 3 . 8 \% )$ ，and $\gamma$ is the recombina tion efficiency of injected holesand electrons,whichis ideally $1 0 0 \%$ only if holes and electrons are fully balanced and completely recombined to form excitons.Thus, the $\eta _ { \mathrm { r } }$ value of the DPTPA device was calculated to be $8 0 \%$ ，whichbreaks through the limit of the radiative exciton ratio of $2 5 \%$ for conventional FOLEDs.Since no delayed fluorescence was observed from transient PL,and the luminance of EL displayed a linear increase with increasing current density, the high radiative exciton ratio does not seem to be in accordance with some mainstream views,such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA).21,22

The hybrid WOLED with the architecture of single-EML was fabricated with the same construction as the previous DPTPAbased device with the only difference that the DPTPA layer contains different concentration of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 - \mathrm { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ from 0.1 to $0 . 9 \mathrm { \ w t \% }$ .As shown in Fig.7a,all of devices with different concentration of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 - \mathrm { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ are showing extremely low turn-on voltage of $2 . 6 { \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ ,and low driving voltages of $4 . 2 \ \mathrm { e V }$ （204 $\left( 0 . 1 ~ \mathrm { w t \% } \right)$ ， $3 . 8 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ （204号 $\left( 0 . 3 ~ \mathrm { w t \% } \right)$ ,and $3 . 5 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ (0.65 and $0 . 9 \ \mathrm { w t \% } \cdot$ ）at a practical brightness of 1000 cd $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ .The EL efficiencies are illustrated in Fig.7b and c and listed in Table 2.When the concentration of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 \mathrm { - p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ is ${ \sim } 0 . 9 \%$ ,the hybrid WOLED exhibitsmaximum total EQE,CE and PE of $2 2 . 3 \%$ ,53.7 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $6 0 . 2 \mathrm { ~ l m ~ W ^ { - 1 } }$ respectively.As decrease of the concentration of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 \mathrm { - p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ ,the efficiencies reduce gradually.When the concentration of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 { \cdot } \operatorname { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ is down to $0 . 1 \%$ ,the efficiencies are declined to be $1 3 . 2 \%$ ,25.8 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $2 9 . 1 \ \mathrm { l m \ W ^ { - 1 } }$ ,respectively, indicating thatabout $5 0 \%$ IQE could be harvested in this concentration. In Fig.7d,a warm white light emission can be realized when the concentration of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 { \cdot } \operatorname { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ is up to $0 . 9 \ \mathrm { w t \% }$ .The corresponding CIE coordinates show a moderate blue shift from (0.51,0.41) to (0.43,0.34) when the brightness increases from 10 to $1 0 \ 0 0 0$ cd $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ .While the doped concentration was decreased to $0 . 6 \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,the CIE coordinateschanged from(0.49, 0.40) to (0.39,O.31), the present white emission is near to the standard white light at high brightness (ESI, $\mathbf { S 1 \dag }$ ).When the concentration was down to $0 . 3 5 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ，the CIE coordinates changed from (0.45,0.36) to (0.29,0.22),Thus,a cold white light can be obtained at high luminance (ESI, $^ { S 2 \dagger } ,$ .Asthe concentration is changed to be $0 . 1 \%$ ，whichis following the conventional principle of the doping concentration regulation,the present spectra cannot be found enough the emission from the phosphorescence even at the high luminance (ESI, $^ { S 2 \dagger } .$ ）

# 2.6Discussion about exciton transfer mechanism in the high concentration of phosphorescent dopant

To clearly demonstrate the exciton transfer mechanism in the high concentration of phosphorescent dopant WOLEDs,we combined the results of theoretical calculations， monochromatic light devices and WOLEDs. Considering the improved dopant concentration in the single-EML-SD $\mathbf { F } / \mathbf { P }$ hybrid WOLEDs,it is suspected that the current relatively high doping concentration should be resulted from the blue emitters with HLCT characters and thus “hot exciton”energy transfer from $\mathrm { T } _ { 5 }$ to $\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ .Due to the part transfer from the triplet excited states to the singlet excited states of the blue emitter, the phosphorescent dopant cannot obtain sufficient energy to emit orange-red light of the traditional devices with the same doping concentration as shown in Fig.8.At the $0 . 9 \mathrm { \ w t \% }$ doping concentration, the fluorescence emission utilize about ${ \sim } 6 0 . 8 \%$ excitons,and about $5 5 \%$ excitons are from the triplet state $\mathrm { T } _ { 5 }$ byhot-excitons process,while the excitons transferred from singlets of the fluorescent to phosphorescent emitters can be calculated the ratio of their fluorescent lifetimes $\big ( L _ { \mathrm { F } } / L _ { \mathrm { P } } \ : = \ : \big ( \tau _ { \mathrm { F } } / \tau _ { \mathrm { P } } \big ) ^ { 0 . 5 } \big ) ^ { 2 3 }$ in the mixed film,and the value from singlets of the fluorescent to phosphorescent emitters is $1 9 . 2 \%$ .The energy transfer from the triplet excited states of DPTPA to those of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 - \mathrm { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ is found to be only $2 0 \%$ Accordingly，a more than $5 5 \%$ of triplet excitons cannot transfer from DPTPA to $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 { \cdot } \operatorname { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ .It means that the insufficient energy can be transferred to the orange-red dopant,and the doping concentration should be improved to a high level. Furthermore,the present results can not only make the future mass production much easier to control accurately,but also a great breakthrough in the device mechanism,and then the design strategy.

# 3． Conclusions

In summary,we have presented a novel imidazole based emitter material forhigh-efficient fluorescent OLED and single-EML $\mathbf { F } / \mathbf { P }$ hybrid WOLED devices.It is notable that the WOLED still exhibited white emission with a maximum total EQE,CE and PE of $2 2 . 3 \%$ ，53.7 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $6 0 . 2 \mathrm { ~ l m ~ W } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively, when the concentration of $\operatorname { I r } ( 2 - \mathrm { p h q } ) _ { 3 }$ is up to $0 . 9 \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,which is not following the conventional principle of the doping concentration regulation. The exciton transfer mechanism in the high concentration of phosphorescent dopant isalso discussed.Meanwhile,the devices also showed low roll of with the efficiencies of $1 6 . 9 \%$ ,38.3 cd $\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ and $3 3 . 2 \ln \mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }$ at 1000 cd $\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ ,it is among the best results for

EML-simplifiedF/P-WOLEDs.The studiesprovideawayto obtain high performance $\mathbf { F } / \mathbf { P }$ hybrid WOLEDs with a simple architecture and high doping concentration for easily manipulation.

# 4.2Devices fabrication and measurement

The EL devices were fabricated by vacuum deposition of the materials at $5 \times { 1 0 } ^ { - 4 }$ Pa or below onto ITO glass with a sheet resistance of $2 0 \Omega$ per square.Before the fabrication of devices, the emitters of PhBPI and BBPI were purified deeply by sublimation.All of the organic layers were deposited at a rate of $1 . 0 \AA ^ { - }$ $2 . 0 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ } \mathbf { s } ^ { - 1 }$ . The cathode was deposited with LiF $( 1 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ ata deposition rate of $0 . 1 \mathring { \textbf { A } } \mathtt { s } ^ { - 1 }$ and then capping with Al metal $\left( 1 0 0 \mathrm { n m } \right)$ through thermal evaporation at a rate of $4 . 0 \mathring \mathrm { A } \ s ^ { - 1 }$ . The electroluminescence (EL） spectra were measured by a PR705 spectra scan spectrometer.The luminance-current density and voltage characteristics were recorded simultaneously with the measurement of Commission Internationale De L'Eclairage (CIE)coordination of these devices by combining the spectrometer CS200 with a Keithley model 2420 programmable voltage-current source.All measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions.
