Zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) which is a dimorphic(cubic or rhombohedral) Prussian blue analogue and can be intercalated by both monovalent and divalent ions,is a promising cathode materialfor rechargeable aqueous metal-ion batteries.ln this paper,a simple co-precipitation methodis developed to tune the particle morphology of ZnHCF by adjusting the dropping speed at room temperature.Three polyhedral ZnHCF particles,with cubooctahedral,truncated octahedral or octahedral shapes,are obtained at room temperature.Structuraltransformation from cubic phase of as-prepared ZnHCF to rhombohedral phase is observed by further dehydration of the sample at $7 0 ^ { \circ } C ,$ whereas the dehydrated ZnHCF crystals still hold the identical polyhedralshape as that of the cubic phase particles.Then the influence of shape and facets on electrochemical performance is studied for polyhedral ZnHCF with rhombohedral structure (RZnHCF). RZnHCF sample with cubooctahedral shape possesses the best rate capability and cyclic stability comparing with RZnHCF particles having truncated octahedral or octahedral shapes.Furthermore, the structure of cuboctahedron RZnHCF particles during electrochemical cycling has been monitored with ex situX-ray difraction to demonstrate the reversible zinc-ion intercalation mechanism.

Dueto the advantages oflowcost,environmental benignnessand high ionic conductivity,rechargeable aqueous metal-ion batteries (RAMB)have a giant application potential in large-scale energy storage.“Rocking-chair" RAMB based on monovalent ions $( \mathrm { L i ^ { + } }$ $\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ or $\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ )have been investigated extensively,but most of them show the shortage of low energy density due to the low operating voltage $( < 1 . { \bar { 5 } } \mathrm { V } ) ^ { 1 - 1 5 }$ . Multivalent metal-ion $( \mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } }$ $Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ 0 $\mathbb { A } ^ { 3 + }$ ,etc.) RAMB are attracting more and more attention because of their potentially higher energy. But only few systems regarding multivalent ions intercalation chemistry have been reported16-18,ascribing to the limits of electrode materials.

In recent years,Prusian blue analogues (PBAs)are widely studied in the energy storage systems as the electrode materials19-23. Among PBAs, metal hexacyanoferrates(MeHCFs) with open-framework structures can not only be inserted by monovalent alkaline cations24 such as $\mathrm { L i ^ { + } }$ $\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ or $\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ ,but can also behave as hosts for divalent or trivalent cations25-27 including $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { g } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\mathrm { A l } ^ { 3 + }$ . Among the reported RAMB with MeHCFs as electrode materials14,26,28,29, most MeHCFs such as CuHCF, NiHCFor CoCuHCF have cubic structure,and the voltages of thebatteries are generally lower than $1 . 5 \mathrm { V }$ due to the relatively high potential of applicable anode materials.Comparing with most reported anode materials in RAMB,metal zinc shows apparently lower potential of $- 0 . 7 8 \mathrm { V }$ vs. standard hydrogen electrodepotential.Moreover,theelectricaldeposition/dissolutionofzincis highlyreversible.Therefore,it provides a viable strategytoachieve highoperating voltage inRAMB basedon zincions.Butthelack ofcathode materials allowing reversible insertion/extraction of divalent $Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ in aqueous electrolytes greatly hinders the development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries.To the best of our knowledge,among the known cathode materials onlyan $\mathrm  \alpha \mathrm  \alpha \mathrm  \alpha \mathrm  \alpha \mathrm  \alpha \mathrm  \alpha \mathrm

intercalation of divalent $Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ in aqueous electrolytes16.Fortunately the structural diversityofMeHCFs makes it posible to design new high-performance divalent metal-ion RAMB, including aqueous zinc-ion batery.Recently, we reported theuse of ZnHCFasa novel cathode materialin RAMB based on zinc ions for the first time30.Combining with $Z \mathrm { n }$ as the anode,the $Z { \mathrm { { n } / Z { \mathrm { { n H C F } } } } }$ system can exhibit a high operating voltage of $1 . 7 \mathrm { V } ,$ giving rise to a high energy density of $1 0 0 \mathrm { W h } \mathrm { k g

Compared to most of MeHCFs with cubic structure,ZnHCFs exhibit the rhombohedral structure in which the $\mathrm { Z n N _ { 4 } }$ tetrahedras are linked to ${ \mathrm { F e C } } _ { 6 }$ octahedras via CN ligands to forma porous three-dimensional framework with large open sites where metal ions such as $\mathrm { { N a ^ { + } } }$ 0 $\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ and ${ \dot { \mathrm { C } } } s ^ { + }$ and water molecules are located.Such a framework endows ZnHCFs withthe posibilityofactingas intercalation hosts for various cations.The structural difference between ZnHCFs and common MeHCFs will undoubtedly lead to different intercalation mechanisms of metal ions.Theions intercalationmechanisms inthecubic MeHCFs havebeenstudiedintensively12,28-29.Thefeasibility of ZnHCFs as intercalation host for $\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ has also been demonstrated by Chio and coworkers23.However, the ions intercalation mechanismof divalent metalions,such as zinc ions in ZnHCFremains to befurther studied.This is the first study on the intercalation mechanism for divalent $\scriptstyle { Z \ n ^ { 2 + } }$ in ZnHCF.Moreover, the effect of the shape and facets of the ZnHCF particles on their electrochemical performance was also systematically investigated in this work.The morphologyand crystal-facet-controlled synthesis of cathode materials have recently attracted considerable attention $\cdot ^ { 3 1 - 3 \overline { { 3 } } }$ and a number of shape-controlled PBAs can be synthesized34-37. For example, Guo's group38 found that high-quality Prussan blue crystals inthe form of nanocubes showed a better electrochemical performance than low-qualitycrystals with a granular morphology.By controlling the reaction conditions,uniform ZnHCF particles witha series ofregular morphologies were successfully prepared,and their relationship between exposed facets and electrochemical performance was proposed, which willgive new insights into the design of high-performance RAMB based on PBAs.

# Results

Shape-controlled Synthesis.In our previous work, the $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { n H C F }$ was synthesized by aconventional co-precipitation reaction between 0.1M $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ and $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { M }$ （204号 $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { F e ( C N ) } _ { 6 }$ aqueous solutions and irregular particles were obtained (Fig. S1a)30.In this work, by reducing the concentrations of aqueous $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ and $\bar { \mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { F e ( C N ) } _ { 6 } }$ solutions to $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { M }$ and adjusting the dropping speed of the reactant solutions,uniform ZnHCF particles with a series of polyhedral shapes canbe prepared atroom temperature,as shown inFig.1.When the aqueous solutionof 0.01M $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ and aqueous solution of 0.01M $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { F e ( C N ) } _ { 6 }$ were poured simultaneously into one beaker, $Z { \mathrm { n H C F } }$ particles with cuboctahedron shape were obtained (Fig.la).Ifthe reactant solutions were mixed slowly by using dropping pipetes in approx.20 minutes,the shape of ZnHCF particles changedto be truncated octahedron (Fig.1b).If the mixing processof the reactant solutions was further elongated to 2hours by using peristaltic pump,the shape of ZnHCF crystals became octahedron (Fig.lc).Figure ld-f displaythe overallmorphology of shape-controlled ZnHCF particles inalargerdomain,whichverifies good homogeneityinboth shapeand sizeofZnHCF particles in each sample.The size distribution of ZnHCF particles is statisticall ploted inFig.1g-i.The particle sizes of all three samples are distributed within a narrow range of $1 { - } 5 { \mu } \mathrm { m }$ .The mean dimension,however,varies slightly between polyhedral particles with diferent shapes.The cuboctahedron ZnHCF(named as C-ZnHCF hereafter) particles possess the smallest mean size of ${ \sim } 1 . 7 \mu \mathrm { m } .$ ,and the truncated octahedron ZnHCF (named as T-ZnHCF hereafter) particles have the largest mean size of ${ \sim } 3 . 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,whereas the average size of octahedron ZnHCF (named as O-ZnHCF hereafter) lies in between $( \sim 2 . 6 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ ：

Figure 2.XRD patterns of cubic phase ZnHCF with cubooctahedral (red),truncated octahedral (green) and octahedral (blue) shapes obtained at room temperature.

XRD analysis (Fig.2)of all three morphology-controlled ZnHCF samples dried at room temperature shows identical diffraction patterns of cubic phase $\mathrm { Z n } _ { 3 } \mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 } \bullet x H _ { 2 } O }$ (PDF#38-0687).So it is easy to deduce that all three polyhedral ZnHCF particlesarebound byentirely $\left\{ 1 0 0 \right\}$ and/or $\{ 1 1 1 \}$ facets of the fcc crystal symmetry. The C-ZnHCF is bound by {11l} and $\left\{ 1 0 0 \right\}$ planes,and the ratio between surface area of $\{ 1 1 1 \}$ facets (S11l) to that of $\left\{ 1 0 0 \right\}$ facets (S100) is estimated tobe 0.6.TheT-ZnHCFhasahigher S111/S100 ratio of ca.1.2,and theO-ZnHCF particles are almost entirely capped by {111} facets.

The morphologyof $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { Z n H C F } }$ crystals is strongly dependent on the concentration of the reactants.The SEM images of $\mathrm { Z n H C F }$ particles synthesized at different concentrations are shown in Fig.S2.At either higher or lower concentrations than $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { M }$ ,irregular particles with no characteristic morphologies were obtained.The concentration of $0 . 0 1 \mathrm { M }$ was found to be the optimal condition to obtain uniform $Z { \mathrm { n H C F } }$ particles with regular morphologies.When $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ and $\mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { F e ( C N ) } _ { 6 }$ aqueous solutions were quickly poured into the beaker, the orange-red precipitate was obtained immediately,indicating fast nucleation.Asseen in the SEMimage (Fig.S3),the uniform $\mathrm { Z n H C F }$ crystals were immediately formed in the solution without the process of agitation and age.What's more, the dropping speed ofreactants which affects the growth of crystals also plays a crucial role in determining the polyhedral shape of theproducts.The formation mechanism of $Z { \mathrm { n H C F } }$ crystals with controlled morphology is illustrated in Fig.3,which can be atributed to the homogeneous nucleationand growth of the crystals.Wang's group9 has previously observed thatthe formation ofvarious diffrent shapes ofan fcc nanocrystal depended on the ratio (R) of the growth rate along $< 1 0 0 >$ to that along ${ < } 1 1 1 { > }$ ,and geometrical shapes of cubooctahedral nanocrystals as a function ofthe ratio R wereillustrated accordingly. According to Wang's theorythe dropping speed of the reactants may affect the R values to determine the shape of ZnHCF crystals in this work and the R valuesof cuboctahedron,truncated octahedronandoctahedron ZnHCF shouldbe 0.87,1.0and1.73,respectively. Above all,we propose in this paper a simple co-precipation method to prepare shape-controlled $Z { \mathrm { n H C F } }$ samples.Althoughsomeshape-controlled Prussanblueanditsanalogues3437 suchas $\begin{array} { r } { \mathrm { M n } _ { 3 } [ \mathrm { C o } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 } } \end{array}$ 1 $\mathrm { C o } _ { 3 } [ \mathrm { C o } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 }$ and $Z { \mathrm { n } } _ { 3 } [ \mathrm { C o } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 }$ have been previously observed,surfactants or hydrothermal process were required in those reports.In our work, ZnHCF particles with diferent regular morphologies could be obtained by controllng the concentrations and adjusting the dropping speed ofreactants in the absenceofsurfactants atambient conditions. Furthermore,this simple reaction procedure can also be applied as a general method to synthesize other PBAs with regular shapes,such as manganese hexcyanoferrate (MnHCF),cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF)and silver hexacyanofarrate (AgHCF), whose SEM images and XRD diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. S4.

Structure Transformation.As mentioned in some works41,42 $\mathrm { Z n } _ { 3 } \mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 } \bullet x H _ { 2 } O }$ with cubic structure is not stable.The water molecules are very easy to escape by heat treatment,transforming its structure to be rhombohedral,which also occurred in our research.Taking $\dot { \mathrm { \mathbf { C } } } – \mathrm { Z n H C F }$ as an example,when it was further dried at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for l2 hours,the sample was dehydrated and transformed to be rhombohedral structure $( Z \mathrm { n } _ { 3 } [ \mathrm { F e } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 } .$ 号 PDF#38-0688),as reflectedbytheXRDpatern shown inFig.4.However,the cubooctahedralshapeofC-ZnHCF is well preserved after the structural transformation.The same phenomenon was also observed in $\mathrm { T } { \cdot } \mathrm { Z n H C F }$ and O-ZnHCF when heated at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for l2 hours,as shown in Fig.S5.The chemical formula of rhombohedral phase ZnHCF (RZnHCF) with cuboctahedron,truncated octahedron and octahedron shapes was found to be $\mathrm { K _ { 0 . 0 7 } Z n [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 0 . 6 9 } } ;$ （204号 $\mathrm { K _ { 0 . 0 8 } Z n [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 0 . 6 7 } }$ and $\mathrm { K _ { 0 . 0 7 } Z n [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 0 . 6 8 } }$ respectively, by inductively coupled plasma optical emision spectrometer (ICP-OES).By thermal gravimetric analysis (Fig.S6),the curves of three RZnHCF samples with diferent shapes were almost overlapped and the mass of water in RZnHCF was negligible. An intriguing effctof shape on the colorofRZnHCF powders was found.Irregular RZnHCFis bright yellow, whereas shape-controlled RZnHCFs show green yellow color.Their UV-Vis difuse reflectance spectra (Fig.S5b) reveals that the cuboctahedron RZnHCF(C-RZnHCF),truncated octahedron RZnHCF(T-RZnHCF)and octahedron RZnHCF(O-RZnHCF) can respectively absorb visible light with a wavelength at $5 6 1 \mathrm { n m }$ ， $5 5 9 \mathrm { n m }$ and $5 5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .For the irregular RZnHCF, the absorption edge is drastically shifted to $5 8 8 \mathrm { n m }$ ,implying that regular shape may affect the frequency of the stretching mode of the cyano anion in RZnHCF.

To clarifythe processof structure transformation from cubic to rhombohedral,itis important to recognize the diversity of the cubic structure of PBAs.The general formula of PBAs is $\mathrm { A _ { x } M [ P ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { y } \bullet n H _ { 2 } O , }$ in which A is alkali metals and $ { \mathrm { ~  ~ \cal ~ M ~ } } \&  { \mathrm { ~  ~ P ~ } }$ are transition metals.When the ratio of $\mathrm { { \vert M / P } }$ is l,there are no vacancies in the cubic structure. If the ratio of $\mathrm { M } / \mathrm { P }$ is not equal to 1, such as $\mathrm { F e _ { 4 } [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 3 } } ^ { 4 3 }$ or $\mathrm { C u } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 6 } { } ^ { 4 4 }$ ,the $\mathrm { [ P ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { z - } }$ vacancies will appear in the cubic structure.In the cubic phase $\mathrm { Z n } _ { 3 } \mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 } \bullet x H _ { 2 } O }$ we synthesized, the $\mathrm { { \mathbf { M } } / \mathrm { { P } } }$ ratio is $3 / 2$ 2 similar to that of $\mathrm { C u } _ { 3 } [ \mathrm { C o } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 2 } ^ { 4 5 }$ ,so the $\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ vacancies are presented as shown in Fig.S7a. According to previous study46,only 2/3 of the $\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ atomic sites are occupied to achieve the electroneutrality with the face-centered cubic framework of $Z \mathrm { n }$ atoms.1/3 of the $\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ atomic sites are left as vacancies in the crystal structure,which are nominally occupied by water molecules to pair with the uncoordinated $Z \mathrm { n }$ atoms.The other uncoordinated water molecules arelocted in thecages ofcubic structure,asseeninFig.S7b.However,removalof allthese water molecules from cubic phase $Z { \mathrm { n H C F } }$ will lead to the instability of the crystal structure, giving rise to a structural transformationas observed inour experiments.This structuraltransformation processis illustrated in Fig.5a,b.Only partof the unit cellis presented in the figures for clarity.After drying of the $\mathrm { Z n } _ { 3 } \mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) } _ { 6 } \mathrm {] } _ { 2 } \bullet \mathrm { x H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ sample at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ ,coordinated water in the crystal is removed,resulting in the transformation of octahedrally coordinated $\mathrm { Z n N } _ { 4 } ( \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } )$ (Fig.5a) to be tetrahedrally coordinated $\mathrm { Z n N _ { 4 } }$ (Fig. 5b).Thus,the N-Zn-N bond in the dehydrated $\mathrm { Z n H C F }$ can no longer sustain its original linearity state in cubic phase $Z { \mathrm { n H C F } } ,$ but formsa bond angle of ${ \sim } 1 0 8 ^ { \circ }$ ,typical of tetrahedral coordination.The $\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] }$ units,however,still approximately preserve their original geometry. Consequently,thechangeofthecoordination conditionof Znleads to the transformationfrom the cubic phase to the rhombohedral phase as shown in Fig.S8.This coordination configuration in $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { R Z n H C F } }$ results in the formation oflarge elipsoidal cavities (Fig.S9),in which the inserted zinc ions can occupy. This structure transformation canbe consideredas adistortion rather than reconstruction ofthe internal atoms, therefore the original morphologies of $Z { \mathrm { n H C F } }$ particles which are typical of cubic symmetry are still preserved in RZnHCF samples.Nevertheless,the structural distortion changes the atomic arrangements on the surfaces of the polyhedral particles.For convenience,the orientations of dehydrated RZnHCF crystals are namedF11l and F100 to correlate with the $\{ 1 1 1 \}$ and $\left\{ 1 0 0 \right\}$ surfaces on fcc polyhedrons whose morphologies are preserved after structure transformation,while their structures demonstrated inFig.S10,are totalldifferent from {11l}and {100} crystal planes in cubic ZnHCF.

Morphology Effect on Electrochemical Performance.The electrochemical performance of the dehydrated RZnHCF samples with different shapes was then studied by three-electrode flooded cells.Figure S11 displays the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of shape-controlled RZnHCF at a scan rate of $2 \mathrm { m V } \mathrm { { s } ^ { - 1 } }$ in $3 \bar { \mathrm { M } } \mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ electrolytes over wide potential ranges,which indicates thatthe electrochemical reactions are thesame accounting for the $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + } / \mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ redox couple.Figure $6 \mathsf { a } - \mathsf { c }$ present the first discharge capacities of C-RZnHCF, T-RZnHCF and O-RZnHCF, respectively,at various discharge rates from $6 0 \mathrm { m A } { \bf \bar { g } } ^ { - 1 }$ to $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m A } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ . At $6 0 \mathrm { { m A } \ g ^ { - 1 } }$ rate C-RZnHCF, T-RZnHCF and O-RZnHCF deliver similar discharge capacities of 69.1,67.3 and $6 6 . 0 \mathrm { m A h } \ \mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ respectively.With the increaseof the dischargerate,the differenceofthe discharge capacitybetweenthreesamples becomes increasingly apparent.The C-RZnHCF exhibits discharge capacities of 68.9,67.4,65.5 and $6 0 . 5 \mathrm { m A h g ^ { - 1 } }$ at 300,600,1200 and $3 0 0 0 \mathrm { m A } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ rate,respectively, while the corresponding capacities of T-RZnHCF are only 66.4,60.2,59.0 and $5 0 . 3 \mathrm { m A h g ^ { - 1 } }$ ,respectively.The discharge values of O-RZnHCF at higher rates are even lower (51.1,47.7,41.3 and $3 6 . 0 \mathrm { m A h } \ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively).Therefore,C-RZnHCF performs the best rate capability among all three samples,and O-RZnHCFthe worst. Although the O-RZnHCF particles are smaller than T-RZnHCF particles,O-RZnHCF performs worse rate capability than T-RZnHCF,implying that the shape of $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { R Z n H C F } }$ compounds is more critical forthe rate performance than their dimensions.Cycling lives of shape-controlled RZnHCF is also evaluated at $3 0 0 \mathrm { m A } \ : \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ rate,and the results are shown in Fig. 6d.After 1O0 cycles,the capacity retention for C-RZnHCF, T-RZnHCF and O-RZnHCF was $9 3 . 0 \%$ $8 6 . 6 \%$ and $7 2 . 0 \%$ ,respectively. Again, C-RZnHCF excels other two samples in the term of cyclic stability.

As all three RZnHCF samples have the same composition and structure,theirdiffrenceon the electrochemical properties thus is ascribed to their diffrent particle shape.As mentioned above,the particles ofC-RZnHCF possess thelargest areal proportionofsurface F100,T-RZnHCF the second,andO-RZnHCF the smallest (capped all by F111).Comparing withthe electrochemical data,it is reasonable to deduce thatthecharge/discharge performance of RZnHCF is positively correlated with the area ofF10o.Figure S12 shows the atomic arrangements along the surface oreintations of polyhedral $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { R Z n H C F } }$ samples.Thus,it is anticipated that F1oo surfaces whose orientations are aligned to zinc ions diffusion channels facilitate high dischargerate capabilities,which is confirmed by impedence measurements (Fig.S13).The low frequency region in the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS, Fig.Sl3a)corresponds to the zinc-ion difusion processwithin the electrodes.Figure S13b shows the relationship between $Z _ { \mathrm { r e } }$ and $\omega ^ { - 1 / 2 }$ in the low frequency region, where $w$ is the angular frequecy $( \omega = 2 \pi \mathrm { f } )$ ). The low slope indicates good zinc-ion kinetics in the electrode materials.The C-RZnHCF shows the lowest slope among all three samples, suggesting best zinc-ion kinetics.It is anticipated that the lessdense atomic arrangements along theF111 directions are more liable to interact with the electrolyteand thus accelerate the sample dissolution.So the C-RZnHCF sample with less F11lorientations in the surface areas will presenta beter cycling performance. In conclusion,the shape of RZnHCF particles with more surface areas with F100 orientations willbe benficial to enhancethe electrochemical performance.The similarinfluenceofsurface orientations ontheions difusionand sample dissolution has been observed in other cathode materials3.

Zinc-ion Battery Properties.Because ofits beter electrochemical performance than other two RZnHCF samples, we chose C-RZnHCF as the cathode and zinc as the anode to manufacture theaqueous zinc-ion battery. The typical CV curves of two individual electrodes along with the full cell at a scan rate of $2 \mathrm { m } \mathrm { V } \mathrm { ~ s } ^ { - 1 }$ are displayed in Fig.7a.The deposition and dissolution of zinc at anode occurs at around oV vs. $Z { \mathrm { n } } / { \mathrm { Z n } } ^ { 2 + }$ .More details about the structure and morphology evolution during charge/discharge processes and electrochemical properties of zinc anode are exhibited in the supporting information (Fig.S14,S15,S16and S17).Allthe evidence confirms that zinc anode is stable during cycling in the zinc-ion batery.Meanwhile,the distinctive reversible redox peaks of cathode appears at ca. $1 . 7 7 \mathrm { V }$ and $1 . 9 7 \mathrm { V }$ vs. $Z _ { \mathrm { { n } } / Z \mathrm { { n } } ^ { 2 + } }$ .The full cell exhibits a similar pair of redox peaks as the cathode,appearing at ca. $1 . 6 8 \mathrm { V }$ and $2 . 0 0 \mathrm { V }$ vs. $Z \mathrm { n } / Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ . The galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of the full cell under a current density of $6 0 \mathrm { { m A } \ g ^ { - 1 } }$ between $0 . 8 \mathrm { V }$ and $2 . 0 \mathrm { V }$ are shown in Fig.7b. It delivers a discharge capacity of $6 6 . 5 \mathrm { m A h } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ based on the mass of active cathode materials $( 6 0 . 7 \mathrm { m A h } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ based on the total mass of active electrode materials).And it has a flat discharge voltage plateau at ca. $1 . 8 \mathrm { V }$ with an average operating voltage of ca. $1 . 7 3 \mathrm { V } ,$ delivering a specific energy density of $1 0 5 \mathrm { \bar { W h } \ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ based on the total mass of active electrode materials(seeFig.S18 for details).The discharging voltage profiles at various current densities are displayed in Fig.7c.Basedonthe mass ofactive cathode materials,itdelivers the discharge capacities of6.5,65.1,63.2,59.2, 50.8, 42.7 and $2 9 . 3 \mathrm { m A h } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at 60,120,180,300,600,900 and $1 2 0 0 \mathrm { m A } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ rate,respectively, showing good rate capability. The discharge capacity retains $8 0 \%$ of the maximum value after charged and discharged at $3 0 0 \mathrm { m A g ^ { - 1 } }$ in the 3M $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ aqueous electrolyte for 200 cycles (Fig.7d),indicating that the cellalso possesses excellent cyclic stability.After50 charge-discharge cycles in the 3M $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ electrolyte,the XRD pattern of C-RZnHCF electrode keeps the same with the original one (Fig.S19),further suggesting the electrochemical stabilityofC-RZnHCF.

Reversible Zinc-ion Intercalation.The investigation of the intercalation mechanism for divalent $Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ in RZnHCF was conducted in a three-electrode flooded cell with an C-RZnHCF working electrode,a Pt counter electrode and an $\mathrm { \ A g / A g C l }$ reference electrode,and ex situ XRD patterns (Fig.8a) of the C-RZnHCF electrode at different discharge/charge states of the first cycle in the aqueous 3 M $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ electrolyte along with corresponding discharge/charge curves (Fig.8b) were measured.Asterisks $( { ^ * } )$ in Fig.8a indicates the XRD peaks of the iron grid reference,which is used to calibrate lattice parameters of the same C-RZnHCF sample at diferent discharge/ charge states.During the $\scriptstyle { Z \ n ^ { 2 + } }$ insertion process,the position of the strongest XRD peak (113) shifts slightly toward higher angles. The (104)and (110) peaks disappear and one peak near (110) peak appears with discharging. The distinct variation of XRD patterns occurs at the (116) and (211) peaks around 2theta of $2 2 ^ { \circ }$ During discharging these two peaks split. (116) peak moves to lower angles and (211) peak moves to higher angles. In addition,the intensity of moved (116)peak increases with the insertion of zinc ions.At the end ofdischarging,its intensity is even higher than the strongest peak (113)ofthe pristine XRD pattern.During the charging process, the XRD pattern evolves in a reverse way comparing with that in the discharging process,and finally recovers to theoriginalstate beforedischarging,indicating thatthe structuralchange along with the insertion/extraction of $\scriptstyle { Z \ n ^ { 2 + } }$ is highly reversible.Figure S20 displays the ex situ XRD patterns measured in the second cycle,which is the same as those in the first one and further confirms reversible zinc-ion intercalation mechanism.

In Fig.8c,the value of the unit cell parameter,a,for the C-RZnHCF,determined from the XRD patterns in Fig.8a,is plotted vs.zinc-ion incorporation, $\mathbf { \delta X } ,$ in $\mathrm { Z n _ { x } Z n H C F e }$ .ZnHCFe represents the formula ofC-RZnHCF, $\mathrm { K _ { 0 . 0 7 } ^ { \mathrm { - } } Z n [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 0 . 6 9 } } ,$ determined by ICP and thermogravimetric analysis.Limited by the number of electrons available from $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + } / \mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ redox couple,the same absolute charge, i.e., $0 . 6 \mathrm { N a } ^ { + }$ or $\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ ,or $0 . 3 Z \mathrm { n } ^ { 2 + }$ is stored per formula unit of ZnHCFe.Thus the value of $\mathbf { x }$ can change from 0 to 0.3.The C-RZnHCF possesses a rhombohedral phase with space group of $R \mathrm { - } 3 c h$ ,so the lattice parameter was calculated by Bragg equation and lattice parameter caculation formula of hexagonal system based on(113) and (024) peaks,which always exist during $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { Z n } ^ { 2 + } }$ insertion/ extraction.The original XRD patern was refined by the Rietveld method in Maud software based on two peaks (113)and(024)(Fig.S21)to indentifythe lattice parameter,a,which was close toour calculation ofthe original one, $1 2 . 2 7 0 \mathring \mathrm { A }$ .The lattice parameter monotonically decreases from $1 2 . 2 7 0 \mathrm { \AA }$ （204 $( \mathbf { x } = 0 )$ to $1 2 . 0 1 7 \mathring \mathrm { A }$ 1 $\mathbf { \check { x } } = 0 . 1 6 )$ upon insertion of zinc ions and slightly increases to $1 2 . 0 \dot { 5 } 5 \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ at $\mathbf { x } = 0 . 1 7$ In the successive discharge process (extraction of zinc ions),the a value then monotonically increases back to $1 2 . 2 6 1 \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ when fully charged,almost the same as that in the original sample,which indicates high reversibility of $\mathrm { Z n } ^ { 2 + }$ intercalation in the RZnHCF framework. However,thedetailed investigationof structuraltransformation of RZnHCF during zinc-ion insertion/extraction needs more experimental evidence,which is currently underway in our lab.

# Discussion

To investigate the influence of morphology on the electrochemical performance,we demonstrate a facile and general procedure for preparation of single-crystalline ZnHCF polyhedrons by a simple co-precipitation method without capping agent.However,Three cubic phase ZnHCFsamples with cubooctahedral,truncated octahedral or octahedral shapes are obtained atroom temperature.Moreover,due to thelostofcoordinated water,the structural transformation from cubic phase to rhombohedral phase occurs when the ZnHCF samples are dried atelevated temperature,whereas the apparent polyhedral shapes are still well maintained.

(b)Typical discharge/charge profiles of C-RZnHCF electrodes obtained at corresponding discharge/charge stages captured for ex situ XRD measurement.For example,after the discharge stage of Dl,the electrode was characterized by XRD to get the D1 XRD pattern. (c) Changes of the value of lattice parameter (a) during $Z \mathrm { n }$ -ion insertion and extraction.

Meanwhile,we found thatthe electrochemical performance of RZnHCF is strongly dependenton their shapes. As aresult,RZnHCF with cuboctahedron morphology exhibits beter performance inthe terms ofrate capability and cyclicstabilitycomparing with other two samples,which implies thatthe diffusion ofzincionsanddissolution ofactive materials is closelycorrelative with the structure ofsurface orientations.While this study is devoted to cathodes based on ZnHCF,a kind of PBAs,with controlled morphology,it seems that the present findings can befurther generalized.Therefore,controlling the shape of PBAs with special facets exposed is believed to be an important means to improve their electrochemical performance.

Becuase of the significantly improved performance derived from the fast zinc-ion diffusion and limited dissolution ofsample,the C-RZnHCF was chosen as the cathode combined with zinc as the anode to manufacture the aqueous zinc-ion battery in 3M $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ electrolytes. Consequently, the battery delivers a high energy density of $1 0 \bar { 4 } \mathrm { W h } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }$ with an average operating voltage of ca.1.73 V. Finaly,ex situ X-raydiffraction techniqueprovides conclusive evidenceofthehighlyreversiblezinc-ionintercalation intherhombohedralframework,whichis helpful to understand the intercalation chemistry based on ZnHCFs.

# Methods

Synthesis of Polyhedral ZnHCF.Polyhedral $\boldsymbol { Z } \mathrm { n H C F }$ particles were obtained by a simple co-precipitation method at room temperature in the absence of surfactants.Typically, $2 \mathrm { m m o l }$ zinc sulfate $( Z \mathrm { n S O } _ { 4 } \bullet 7 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } ,$ Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd, Shanghai, China) was dissolved in $2 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ deionized water to obtain solution A,and 2 mmol potassium ferricyanide $\mathrm { { ' } K _ { 3 } F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } } .$ ，Aladdin Industrial Inc, Shanghai, China) was also dissolved in $2 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ deionized water to obtain solution B.Then,solution Aand solution B were simultaneously added into an emptybeaker under vigorous stirring at room temperature,and the addition time ofsolution Aand B was controlled.After stiring for 24hours atroom temperature,the suspensions were left to stand forl2hours.Then, the obtained solids were fltered,washed with deionized water,and dried at room temperature toobtain cubic ZnHCF.For preparing the cathode electrode,the as-synthesized ZnHCF solids were further dried at $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 12 hours.The shapes of the polyhedral ZnHCFcould be tuned by adjusting the addition time of solution A and B.When solution Aand B were poured into the beaker within a total addition time of several seconds,ZnHCF with cuboctahedron shape was obtained.If the reaction solutions were dropped by plastic pipetes within a time span of ${ \sim } 2 0$ minutes,truncated octahedral ZnHCF particles were prepared. And the octahedron shape particles could be formed by further elongating the addition time to ${ \sim } 2 \mathrm { h }$ , using a peristaltic pump. The synthesis method of irregular ZnHCF has been introduced in our previous work30.

Synthesis of MnHCF, CoHCF and AgHCF with Regular Shapes.2 mmol manganese sulfate, cobalt sulfate or silver nitrate $\mathrm { ( M n S O _ { 4 } \bullet H _ { 2 } O , }$ （204号 $\mathrm { C o } \bar { \mathrm { S } } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 } { \bullet } 7 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ or $\mathrm { A g N O } _ { 3 } .$ purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.or Aladdin Industrial Inc,Ltd, Shanghai, China) was dissolved in $2 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ deionized water to obtain solution A, and $2 \mathrm { m m o l }$ potassium ferricyanide $( \mathrm { K } _ { 3 } \mathrm { F e } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 6 } ,$ Aladdin Industrial Inc,Shanghai, China) was also dissolved in $2 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ deionized water to obtain solution B.Then,solution Aand B were poured into the beaker under vigorous stirring in several seconds.After agitation and aging for $1 2 \mathrm { h }$ ,the products were filtered and washed bydeionized water.Finally,itwasdriedat $7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Materials Characterization.Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were performed on an AXS D8 Advance diffractometer( $\mathrm { { C u K } \mathrm { { \alpha } } }$ radiation, $ \lambda = 1 . 5 4 0 6 \mathring \mathrm { A }$ ; receiving slit, $0 . 2 \mathrm { m m }$ ; scintillation counter, 40 mA; $4 0 \mathrm { k V }$ )from Bruker Inc. $E x$ -situ XRD diffraction patterns of cathode electrodes at various charge/discharge states were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer operating in Bragg-Brentano geometry with Cu $\operatorname { K } \alpha$ radiation. The morphologyof particles was observed bya Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning-electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of $8 \mathrm { k V . }$ The UV-Vis diffusivereflectancespectra were obtained by Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 spectrometer.Thermal gravimetric analysis was performed ona Pyris Diamond thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer(Perkin-Elmer)toanalyze the water content in three polyhedral ZnHCFs powders.The K: Zn:Fe ratios of shape-controlled RZnHCFs were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Optima 2100 DV).The chemical formulas of C-RZnHCF,T-RZnHCFand O-RZnHCF was found to be $\mathrm { K _ { 0 . 0 7 } Z n [ F e ( \bar { C } N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 0 . 6 9 } }$ $\mathrm { K _ { 0 . 0 8 } Z n [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 0 . 6 7 } }$ and $\mathrm { K _ { 0 . 0 7 } Z n [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] _ { 0 . 6 8 } }$ ,respectively.

Electrochemical Measurement. Electrochemical measurements were carried on Solartron 1470E multi-channelpotentiostats using eithera two-electrode ora three-electrodecellsetup.Composite electrodes were cast on steel iron grid.The slurries were prepared by mixing active materials $( 7 5 \mathrm { w t \% } )$ ,SuperP $( 1 5 \mathrm { w t \% } )$ ） and polyvinylidene fluoride $( 1 0 ~ \mathrm { w t \% } )$ in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone.Finally, electrodes were dried at $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 2 \mathrm { h }$ inair.Discs with diameter of $1 . 3 \mathrm { c m }$ were cut for electrochemical tests.Mass loadings for the electrodes were determined by comparing the massoftheelectrode with thatof the original blank one.Typical electrode active material loading was ca. $\mathrm { 8 } \mathrm { m g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ . The electrode for ex situ X-ray measurement was prepared by extracting the cathode from the three-electrode celland washing it with de-ionized wateranddrying at room temperature.For three-electrode setup,an $\mathrm { A g / A g C l }$ electrode and $\mathrm { P t }$ gauze were employed as reference and counter electrodes, respectively.For the two-electrode cell, the zinc anode was prepared by mixing $Z \mathrm { n }$ power, activated carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride to obtain the slurry at an appropriate viscosity, which was then coated on current collector, dried at $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ and punched into discs of $1 . 3 \mathrm { c m }$ in diameter.3Maqueous $\mathrm { Z n S O _ { 4 } }$ solution was used as the electrolytes.The mass ratio of active anode materials to active cathode materials $( 9 : 1 0 0 )$ can be referred to our previous work30.
