Abstract: Deserts are sensitive to environmental changes caused by human interference and are prone to degradation. Revegetation can promote the reversal of desertification and the subsequent formation of fixed sand.However, the effects of grazing, which can cause the ground-surface conditions of fixed sand to further deteriorate and result in re-desertification,on the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from soils remain unknown. Herein,we investigated GHG fluxes in the Hobq Desert, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China,at the mobile (desertified),fixed (vegetated),and grazed (re-desertified) sites from January 2018 to December 2019.We analyzed the response mechanism of GHG fluxes to micrometeorological factors and the variation in global warming potential (GWP). $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ was emitted at an average rate of 4.2, 3.7,and $1 . 1 \ \mathrm { m m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } h ) }$ and $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ was emitted at an average rate of O.19,O.15,and $0 . 0 9 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / ( m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { \cdot h } )$ at the grazed, fixed,and mobile sites, respectively. Mean $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ consumption was as follows: fixed site $( 2 . 9 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } \bullet h ) } ) >$ grazed site $( 2 . 7 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } h ) } ) >$ mobile site $( 1 . 1 \ \mathrm { \mu m o l / ( m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { \cdot h ) } )$ .GHG fluxes varied seasonally, and soil temperature $( 1 0 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ and soil water content $( 3 0 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ were the key micrometeorological factors affecting the fluxes. The changes in the plant and soil characteristics caused by grazing resulted in increased soil $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions and decreased $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ absorption. Grazing also significantly increased the GWP of the soil ${ ( P { < } 0 . 0 5 ) }$ . This study demonstrates that grazing on revegetated sandy soil can cause re-desertification and significantly increase soil carbon and nitrogen leakage. These findings could be used to formulate informed policies on the management and utilization of desert ecosystems.

# 1Introduction

Soil is a major source of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) in terrestrial ecosystems and can be either a source or a sink in the global carbon cycle (Mosier et al.,1998). Land desertification is a crucial ecological issue that threatens sustainable development. Approximately $2 5 \%$ of the Earth's total land area is affected by desertification.The fragile vegetation and soil systems in these regions affect the stability of the soil carbon pool,leading to the release of sequestered soil carbon, which increases total greenhouse gas (GHG） emissions，which are predominately emitted by industrial fossil fuels,and accelerates global warming (Poulter et al.,2O14). Several studies have focused on soil GHG fluxes in forests，wetlands,agricultural lands,and grassland ecosystems (Lohila et al.，2O03；Wu and Yao,2O1O). Scholars have realized the importance of desert ecosystems in the carbon cycle. In recent years,several studies were conducted on seasonal changes in GHG fluxes (Wang et al,202O), environmental and anthropogenic influences (Subke et al.,2003; Liu etal.,2015),and soil respiration components (Castillo-Monroy et al.,2011) in desert ecosystems. Human intervention can lead to complex changes in fragile sand,and scholars have mainly focused on the processes of desertification and vegetation restoration (Wang et al, 2021); however, the subsequent re-desertification of fixed sandy areas is not well understood.

The Hobq Desert is the seventh largest desert in China. The structure and function of the ecosystem in its eastern region have been severely damaged due to several years of cultivation, grazing,and other human intervention. Since the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century, forestry authorities have begun to restore the area via artificial vegetation，which has gradually fixed the mobile sand. In this process，regional microhabitats were developed to increase vegetation cover,resulting in the formation of ecosystems and community succession (Burquez et al.，2O1O).Furthermore,the soil-vegetation interactions can affect soil physical-chemical traits,root distribution,microbial colonization,and soil fauna activities, promote the development and succession of biological crusts (Hammad et al.,2O2O),and indirectly change the spatial and temporal paterns in soil GHG fluxes.It has been suggested that artificial vegetation substantially changed the soil-vegetation system and water and temperature equilibriums,leading to altered rates of GHG emissions from sandy soil (Song et al., 2O12; Zhang et al., 2013).

Grazing in fixed sandy areas with vegetation cover can yield favorable economic benefits. However, environmental heterogeneity, water shortage,and soil infertility are ongoing problems in newly fixed sandy areas.Therefore, the vegetation has limited resistance and resilience to disturbance and is vulnerable to degradation (Elena et al, 2O2O). Grazing on such fragile land could result in a sharp reduction in vegetation cover, fragmentation of surface biocrust,and reappearance of bare sand patches on the land surface,resulting in land re-desertification. In typical grasslands,grazing plays an important role in regulating GHG emission and absorption. Grazing changes the plant community composition (Mark, 2O2O),reduces the accumulation of litter and soil carbon storage,and alters the physical and chemical properties of plants and soils, thus afecting GHG emissons from the grassland ecosystem. However, unlike typical grasslands, it remains unknown how grazing and subsequent changes in the soil microenvironment affect soil GHG emission patterns in fixed sandy areas.

In this study, the effects of sandy soil alteration caused by vegetation restoration and grazing on desert ecosystems were investigated in a sand-binding area of the Hobq Desert.We selected three sites in the area, including mobile (desertified),fixed (vegetated),and grazed (re-desertified) sites. The grazed site had previously been mobile dune sand, which was then vegetated (fixed),but re-desertification occurred due to grazing. The background characteristics of landform and soil of the three sites were homologous,but they have been diferentiated due to the interference of human activities,resulting in different landscape features and vegetation types. We aimed to determine the effect of sandy soil changes caused by grazing or revegetation on GHG fluxes,identify the seasonal variations in GHG fluxes,and investigate the micrometeorological factors driving changes in GHG fluxes.The results of this study can provide scientific evidence for the rational utilization and management of desert ecosystems in the context of global climate change.

# 2.1Study area and experimental site

The study area is located in the southeast of the Hobq Desert, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, with a total area of approximately $1 . 0 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ \mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ and an elevation of $1 1 0 0 { - } 1 3 0 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ The study area has a temperate continental climate with substantial seasonal variation, characterized by hot rainy summers and cold dry winters. The annual average temperature is $8 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，and the frost-free time is approximately $1 3 5 { \mathrm { d } }$ . The average annual precipitation is $3 1 7 \mathrm { m m }$ ; rainfall mainly occurs from June to September, which accounts for $8 4 . 4 \%$ of the annual rainfall. The mean annual evaporation is $2 5 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ .The mean annual wind speed is $3 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ ,and there is strong wind erosion in this area.The soil types in the study area are mainly aeolian sandy soil formed by aeolian sand flow deposits. The vegetation is mainly composed of Salix cheilophila C.K. Schneid., Artemisia ordosica Krasch.,and Caragana korshinskii Kom.

Human intervention, such as revegetation and grazing,has resulted in dramatic sandy soil changes. Based on a combination of factors,for example,the degree of desertification, the stage of vegetation recovery, the status of surface biocrust development, and the degree of interference, we established the three sites: mobile,fixed,and grazed sites.The mobile site $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } 0 5 ^ { \prime } 4 6 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { N }$ $1 1 0 ^ { \circ } 5 3 ^ { \prime } 3 8 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ had mobile, bare sand with a low vegetation cover (only a few annual herbs), severe wind erosion, and no biocrust cover on the surface.At the fixed site $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } 0 5 ^ { \prime } 0 1 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { N }$ ， $1 1 0 ^ { \circ } 5 2 ^ { \prime } 4 9 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ ， artificial vegetation has been carried out since 2OO2 by belt cutting branches of S. cheilophila,and the planting specification was $2 \ \mathrm { m } { \times } 1 \ \mathrm { m }$ .Following natural sparsity and artificial rejuvenation, a stable S. cheilophila community formed,accompanied by A. ordosica,with a high vegetation cover, a thick layer of organic mater on the surface,and the formation of a lichen-moss biocrust with a thickness of $1 3 . 2 \ ( \pm 2 . 1 ) \ \mathrm { m m }$ ，At the grazed site $( 4 0 ^ { \circ } 0 4 ^ { \prime } 3 9 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { N } .$ ， $1 1 0 ^ { \circ } 5 3 ^ { \prime } 5 4 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ ， free grazing began in the spring of 2O15, with a grazing intensity of 1.5 sheep/hm². Under grazing disturbance, vegetation cover was significantly reduced and the surface biocrust was degraded, with a crust thickness of $8 . 5 \ ( \pm 1 . 7 ) \ \mathrm { \ m m }$ ， Scattered patches of bare sand began to appear on the surface, indicating that re-desertification was occurring.

# 2.2 Measurement of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes

2.2.1 Variation characteristics of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ ,and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ fluxes

Within each of the three sites,areas with flat terrain and relatively consistent habitats were selected for sampling,and five plots were established.A GHG flux test was conducted over 24 months from January 2018 to December 2O19.At each site,one sample was collcted at the beginning,middle,and end of each month, that is,for each sampling site,gas samples were collected 36O times during the test period. Soil was collected and the $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ， $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ ，and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ concentrations were determined using static black box-meteorological chromatography (Hangs et al.,2013). The static black box consisted of a cylindrical top box of $3 2 0 \ \mathrm { m m } { \times } 6 0 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ and a pedestal. The top wall was equipped with a stirring fan to evenly mix the gas in the box.The base was placed at the clearing, which was not covered by the S.cheilophila canopy,and was at least 1 m away from the base of the plant. We selected all sampling plots according to specific standards to ensure the consistency of basic meteorological elements and to eliminate systematic errors caused by varying distances from plants. The base was pre-embedded into the soil $( 2 0 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ for stability. For sampling,the box was placed in the pedestal groove and water was used to seal the box. Gas sampling was only performed on sunny days. If it was not sunny on a sampling day, sampling was delayed or advanced by one to three days. Sampling took $3 0 \ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ and was conducted between O9:00 and 12:00 (LST). Gas samples were taken three times,at 0,15,and 30 min. Because the sampling plots were scattered,we arranged regular personnel at each site in order to ensure the gas collection of the three sample sites can be carried out synchronously, eliminating the error caused by the time difference. The sampling container was a $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ syringe with a three-way valve. The gas was stored in an aluminum foil airbag for transportation to the laboratory where the gas concentration was determined within one week. Concentrations of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ ，and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ in the airbags were determined using an Agilent 489oD gas chromatograph (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

Diurnal variation in gas flux was observed 11 times in July and August of both 2O18 and 2019. Each diurnal change observation began at O6:Oo,and the gas was collected every $2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ until 04:00 the next day.A total of 12 gas samples were collected in a day.

We calculated the GHG fluxes based on the change in gas concentrations over time (Song et al., 2008). Positive values indicate the emission of GHGs from soil,and negative values represent that the soil absorbs GHGs from the atmosphere.We calculated the gas flux according to the following formula:

$$
F = \rho \times h \times \frac { d C } { d t } \times \frac { 2 7 3 } { 2 7 3 + \mathrm { T } } ,
$$

where $F$ represents the gas flux of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ $( \mathrm { m m o l } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { h } ) )$ ， $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ $( \mu \mathrm { m o l } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { h } ) )$ ,and $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ （204号 $( \mu \mathrm { m o l } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \cdot \mathrm { h } ) )$ $\rho$ is the gas density under standard conditions $( \mathrm { k g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } )$ ·， $h$ is the height of the closed static chamber $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ ； dC/dt is the rate of change in the GHG concentration during measurement; and $\mathrm { \Delta T }$ is the temperature inside the chamber ${ \mathrm { ( } } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { \mathrm { ) } }$

# 2.2.2 Global warming potential (GWP)

Global warming potential(GWP) is usually used to measure the contribution of different types of GHGs to global warming. GWP is calculated in terms of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ equivalent over a 100-a time scale, and the GWP of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ and ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ is 28 and 265 times that of $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ ,respectively, i.e., $1 \ \mathrm { g } \ C \mathrm { H } _ { 4 } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { = } 2 8 \ \mathrm { g }$ $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ and $1 \ { \mathrm { g } } \ { \mathrm { N } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { O } } / { \mathrm { m } } ^ { 2 } { = } 2 6 5 \ { \mathrm { g } } \ { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 2 } / { \mathrm { m } } ^ { 2 }$ (IPCC, 2014).

# 2.3 Micrometeorological factors

Micrometeorological factors at the mobile, fixed, and grazed sites were monitored continuously from January 2018 to December 2O19. Rainfall was recorded using a small automatic weather station (HOBO U3O-NRC，Onset，Bourne，USA）every $3 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ .Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured using a light sensor (HOBO LIA-MOO3, Onset, Bourne, USA) at a height of $3 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ above the ground.Wind speed was measured using a wind sensor (HOBO WSB-MOO3, Onset, Bourne, USA). Air temperature and humidity were measured using sensors (HOBO S-THB-M002, Onset and HOBO S-THB-M008, Onset, Bourne, USA) at heights of 2.5 and $0 . 1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ above the ground, respectively. Soil water content was measured using a soil moisture sensor(TDR1Oo, Campbell Scientific,Logan,Germany)，at depths of 10, 20,and $3 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ Soil temperature was measured using a temperature sensor (TCAV, Campbell Scientific, Logan, Germany),at depths of 10,20,and $3 0 \mathrm { c m }$

Biomass and soil properties of the three sites were investigated at the plot level in August 2018 (Table1).Three $1 0 \ \mathrm { m } { \times } 1 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ shrub plots were set up diagonally in each standard land,and five 1 $\mathrm { m } { \times } 1 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ herbaceous plots were randomly selected from each shrub plot to investigate vegetation community characteristics,e.g.， plant species, height, coverage, and density. The soil profile was collected by digging into the center of each shrub quadrat, and three soil samples were collected at a depth of $0 { - } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ and mixed to form a single composite sample. Samples were taken back to the laboratory for air drying,crushing,and sieving. The external potassium dichromate-sulfuric acid oxidation heating method was used to determine the soil organic carbon.The Kjeldahl method was used to determine soil total nitrogen content. Soil total phosphorus content were determined using an elemental analyzer (FP-LIBS,FELLES,Tianjin, China). The ring-knife method wasused to determine the soil bulk density. The quantity of soil microorganisms，including bacteria, actinobacteria,and fungi, was analyzed.An UltraClean DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Solana Beach, CA, USA） was used to extract total microorganism DNA,and a PCR instrument $\left( \mathbf { C } 1 0 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { r m } } } \right.$ Touch Thermal, Bio-Rad, CA, USA） was used for amplification. Finally, the quantity of microorganisms was estimated via fluorescence ration PCR (CFX96,Bio-Rad, CA, USA).

# 2.4 Statistical analysis

Excel and Origin were used for data processing and visualization,and SPSS 2O.O software was used for statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA） and least significant difference (LSD） test were used to determine differences in GHG fluxes among the mobile, fixed,and grazed sites $_ { ( P = 0 . 0 5 ) }$ . Two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was used to determine the effects of sandy soil changes and season on GHG fluxes. The effects of micrometeorological factors on GHG fluxes were investigated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Redundancy analysis (RDA） was used to analyze the main factors affecting GHG fluxes in the growing season (from May to October), non-growing season (from November to April of the following year),and the whole study period.A total of 1O8O samples of each gas flux were obtained from the three sites during the study period, with 540 each in both the growing season and non-growing season.

# 3.1 Environmental variables in the study area

The average air temperature in the study area in 2O18 and 2O19 was $8 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $8 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ respectively. Cumulative precipitation was $3 3 3 . 2 \ \mathrm { m m }$ in 2018 and $3 6 9 . 6 \ \mathrm { m m }$ in 2019.Soil temperature $( 0 { - } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } )$ in the study area was $0 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ lower in 2018 than in 2019,and soil water content was $5 . 7 \%$ higher in 2O18 than in 2O19 (Fig.1). Significant differences in soil temperature and soil water content were detected among the three sites. Soil temperature at the mobile site was higher than that at the fixed and grazed sites by $3 6 . 5 \%$ and $1 9 . 3 \%$ ,respectively. The mobile site also exhibited the highest soil water content,and was $1 7 . 8 \%$ and $2 7 . 3 \%$ higher than that of the fixed and grazed sites, respectively.

# 3.2Spatial and temporal variations in GHG fluxes

The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ ,and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ fluxes in 2018 and 2019 are shown in Figures 2 and 3.Emissions of $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ and ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ were detected from the mobile,fixed,and grazed sites,whereas $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ absorption occurred at all sites.However, GHG fluxes varied significantly among the sites. The $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emission flux followed the order of grazed site $( 4 . 2 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } h ) } ) { \succ }$ fixed site $( 3 . 7 ~ \mathrm { m m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } h ) } ) 5 !$ mobile site（1.1 $\mathrm { m m o l } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { h } ) )$ ； the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emission flux followed the order of grazed site $( 0 . 1 9 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } \cdot h ) } ) \div$ fixed site $( 0 . 1 5 \mu \mathrm { m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } \cdot h ) } ) >$ mobile site $( 0 . 0 9 \mathrm { \mu m o l / ( m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { \cdot h ) ) }$ ; and the $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ absorption flux followed the order of fixed site $( 2 . 9 \mu \mathrm { m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } h ) } ) >$ grazed site $( 2 . 7 \mu \mathrm { m o l / ( m ^ { 2 } { \cdot } h ) } ) >$ mobile site $( 1 . 1 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l / ( m } ^ { 2 } \cdot \mathrm { h ) ) }$ ： No significant differences were detected in GHG fluxes between 2O18 and 2O19,but significant seasonal variations were observed.At the three sites, $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions were the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. At the mobile site, $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ was briefly absorbed in the winter. Similar to the other two sites, ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions were greater in spring and summer, and more $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ was absorbed in spring and summer, but the absorption volume decreased significantly in autumn and winter.

$\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ fluxes exhibited daily variation patterns,and the fluxes were al greater in the daytime than in the nighttime (Fig. 4).For the mobile, fixed,and grazed sites, $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions were the highest between 10:0O and 12:00.The ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions were the highest from 14:00 to 16:00 at the mobile site,from 10:00 to 12:00 at the fixed site,and from 12:00 to 14:00 at the grazed site.The absorption of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ was the greatest from 16:0O to 18:0O at the mobile site,and from 12:00 to 14:00 at both the fixed and grazed sites.

Results of the two-way ANOVA revealed that sandy soil changes, season,and their interaction significantly affected $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ fluxes $( P { < } 0 . 0 1$ ； Table 2). The partial $\eta ^ { 2 }$ indicated that $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ flux was more affected by season than by sandy soil changes,whereas the effect of sandy soil changes on $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ flux was significantly greater than that of season. $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ flux was not affected by sandy soil changes; however, ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux exhibited seasonal variations.

# 3.3 Variations in soil GWP

There were significant differences in GHG fluxes among the mobile, fixed,and grazed sites.The grazed site exhibited the highest $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions,and the fixed site had the highest $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ absorption (Fig. 5). The grazed site had the highest GWP $( 1 5 9 7 . 7 ~ \mathrm { g } ~ \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { a } ) )$ , followed by the fixed site $( 1 4 0 1 . 6 ~ \mathrm { g } \mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { a } ) )$ and the mobile site ( $4 4 0 . 8 \ \mathrm { g } \ C \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } / ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathrm { a } ) )$ ：

# 3.4Correlations between micrometeorological factors and GHG fluxes

To determine the effects of micrometeorological factors on $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ， $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ ，and $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ fluxes,we performed the Pearson's linear regression analysis (Fig. 6) and redundancy analysis (Fig.7). The linear regression analysis showed that $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ flux at the mobile,fixed,and grazed sites had a significant positive correlation with atmospheric, surface,and soil temperatures at each depth. Soil water content, rainfall, and PAR were also significantly positively correlated with $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ flux. $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ flux at the grazed site was significantly positively correlated with rainfall， whereas it was not correlated with temperature. At the fixed site, ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux was significantly positively correlated with the surface soil water content $( 1 0 \ \mathrm { c m } )$ ,but not with any other variables (Fig.6). In contrast, ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux at the mobile site was significantly correlated with temperature,soil water content, and PAR. At the fixed and grazed sites, $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ flux was significantly negatively correlated with humidity and atmospheric,surface,and soil temperatures at each depth. $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ flux at the mobile site was significantly correlated with the deep soil water content $( 3 0 \mathrm { c m } )$ , but not with any other variables.

According to the results from Figure 7,during the growing season, the cumulative contribution of the first (soil water content at a depth of $3 0 \mathrm { c m }$ ,SWC-30) and second (surface soil temperature, T-10） principal components was $8 3 . 2 \%$ (Fig. 7a). The former explained $4 0 . 5 \%$ of the variation and the latter explained $2 4 . 5 \%$ of the variation. The mobile site was distinctly separated along RDA1,showing a positive relationship of fluxes with soil water content and soil moisture in the lower layer. During the non-growing season, the cumulative contribution of the first (SWC-30) and second (PAR) principal components was $8 7 . 6 \%$ (Fig.7b).The former explained $5 1 . 4 \%$ of the variation and the latter explained $1 3 . 1 \%$ of the variation. $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ flux was significantly and negatively correlated with SWC-3O and PAR，which are consistent with the results of linear correlation analysis.The three sites had comparable micrometeorological characteristics.

Over the study period,the cumulative contribution of the first (T-1O) and second (SWC-30) principal components was $8 1 . 3 \%$ (Fig.7c). The former explained $4 0 . 9 \%$ of the variation and the latter explained $1 4 . 5 \%$ of the variation.There was no separation among the three sites.

and belowground biomass (Table 1). The synergistic effects of soil-vegetation systems caused spatial heterogeneity of soil $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ flux in desert soils to a large extent,and soil respiration was significantly enhanced with vegetation restoration and biocrust development. The primary sources of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions from sandy soil are plant root respiration, cryptogam respiration in biocrust, soil microbial respiration, and soil animal respiration (Cable et al., 2O11).Autotrophic respiration is performed by living plant roots,and dead plant roots are a substrate for heterotrophic respiration by soil microorganisms; therefore,root growth can improve soil aeration (Rustad et al.,2000). Consequently, increased root biomass will increase $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions.An increase in aboveground biomass means that the canopy covers a larger area， where it can effectively regulate microclimate and condense soil resources,forming "fertility islands" under shrubs,creating ideal conditions for the formation and colonization of biocrust (Hu et al.,2Oo2). Castillo-Monroy et al. (2011）reported that biocrust autotrophic respiration was the main contributor to respiration in desert soil, accounting for up to $42 \%$ of the total respiration. In this study,a mixed crust had developed at the fixed site,explaining why the $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions from the fixed site were significantly greater than those from the mobile site. Soil-vegetation interactions can directly affect soil factors and thus indirectly affect soil $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen content were significantly higher at the fixed site (Table 1),which can also explain the higher $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions from this site. Soil organic carbon is a substrate for biological growth. Soils with high organic carbon contents generally have higher biological activities and thus higher respiration rates (Priess et al.， 2Oo1). Nitrogen is an important component of amino acids, proteins，nucleotides，and coenzymes，and can directly affect photorespiration and root cell mitochondrial respiration (Fitter et al.，1999).Soil bacteria, fungi，and actinomycetes use soil organic matter in heterotrophic respiration. The higher microbial biomass at the fixed site could also explain the higher $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions.

The air permeability of sandy soil provides an ideal aerobic environment for nitrifying bacteria, explaining why sandy soil is often a source of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions.In this study, ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission rate of the fixed site was greater than that of the mobile site. Vegetation restoration reduces soil compactness,creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of microorganisms,thereby increasing autotrophic or heterotrophic nitrification and subsequent $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions(Wolf and Russow,2Ooo).Additionally， soil organic carbon and nitrogen are essential for nitrification; chemotrophic nitrifying bacteria use soil organic carbon as an energy source and oxidize $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ or organic compounds to form ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ and other $\mathbf { N }$ -containing gases (Papen and Rennenberg,1990). Therefore,the increased soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents at the fixed site also explained the higher $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions.

In this study,the sandy soil at all sites absorbed $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ . In the process of vegetation restoration, improvements to micrometeorological and environmental conditions can gradually increase the amount of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ absorbed by soil.Methane-oxidizing bacteria generally oxidize and consume $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ in soil under aerobic conditions.Under anaerobic conditions,fiber-decomposing bacteria and methane-producing bacteria in the soil produce $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ and release it into the atmosphere(van den Pol-van Dasselaar and Oenema,1999;Yu et al.,2OO6)．At the fixed site,the increase in aboveground biomass produced a better shading effect and promoted the development of mixed crusts，resulting in good soil aeration.Meanwhile, the increase in plant root biomass also increased soil porosity and decreased soil bulk density (Table 1). This higher porosity likely led to greater air permeability, thereby promoting oxidation (and thus absorption) of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ ：

# 4.2 Effects of grazing on GHG fluxes

Grazing has two effects on the regulation of GHGs: (1） it changes the carbon pool of the ecosystem and thus has a direct impact on GHG emissions (Jones et al., 2Ol7)；and (2） it indirectly affects the exchange of ecosystem and atmospheric GHGs by changing soil physical, chemical, and biological properties (Zhou et al.,2O1O). However,after reviewing the literature, we found that the effects of grazing on soil GHG emissions varies with climate conditions and soil physicochemical properties (Howden et al.,1994; Wang et al., 2003; Soussana et al., 2007; Dunmola et al., 201O; Zhou et al., 2011; Shi et al.,2017). In this study, grazing increased $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions. In grasslands,livestock grazing usually does not degrade the surface soil, but can decrease the belowground biomass and reduce the soil respiration rate. However, in deserts, the soil surface is fragile and vegetation and biocrust can easily be destroyed by livestock, exposing organic carbon to the surface where it can be oxidized into $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and emitted into the atmosphere (Cao et al., 2012).

The effects of grazing on ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux also vary considerably among previous studies (Table 3). Most studies on grasslands show that grazing does not significantly affect $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions,and that seasonal dynamics as well as source and sink patterns do not fluctuate significantly. However, in the present study, grazing increased ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emissions from sandy soil. This could be attributed to the loose structure of the soil, which can be easily compacted under livestock trampling,resulting in a higher soil bulk density,reduced soil porosity (Table 1),limited oxygen diffusion,and reduced oxygen concentration in the soil. These factors could result in a higher denitrification rate under anaerobic conditions (Douglas and Crawford，1993)，thus promoting $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions. Furthermore,livestock excrement is a primary source of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ (de Klein et al., 2014). Deposition and decomposition of livestock excrement add nitrogen to the soil. An increase in $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ substrates increases nitrification and, subsequently, ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions.

Similar to most previous studies (Table 3),we found that grazing reduced soil absorption of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ .Grazing increased the surface soil bulk density, leading to a decrease in the water-holding capacity. This likely led to increased seepage resistance and decreased gas diffusion, resulting in anaerobic microsites where $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ could be produced.

# 4.3 Factors controlling GHG fluxes

Pearson's linear correlation and Redundancy analysis revealed that T-1O and SWC-3O had the most significant influence on GHG emissions. GHG fluxes at the mobile,fixed,and grazed sites were significantly affected by seasonal changes. GHG fluxes followed a similar trend to soil water content and temperature, being high in spring and summer but low in autumn and winter. This trend was consistent across all sites. GHG emissions and absorption are the products of soil bio-metabolism and biochemical processes，which are sensitive to water and temperature conditions. Within a specific range，an increase in soil temperature can accelerate the decomposition of organic matter, increasing plant roots and soil microorganism metabolism rates, and thus increasing GHG emissions from soil (Brito et al.，2O15). However, at extremely low $( < 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ or high temperatures $( { > } 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ , root activity, methanogenesis,and nitrification are inhibited (Yu et al.,2OO6),which explain the lower GHG fluxes in autumn and winter. In this study, in both growing and non-growing seasons, the soil water content at $3 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ had a significantly higher effect on GHG fluxes than those at other soil depths, potentially because the roots of the dominant species(S. cheilophila and $A$ 、ordosica） dominated the $2 0 { \ - } 4 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ soil layer. Soil water content affects soil permeability, $\mathsf { p H }$ ，microbial activity,and the gas diffusion rate,which are closely related to plant root distribution (Chimner and Cooper, 2OO3). High soil water content can also alter root structure and increase root exudates which, in turn, increase soil carbon and soil microbial activity (de Vries et al., 2O19), thereby increasing GHG emissions.

# 5 Conclusions

In this study, the ecosystem of the sand-binding area was still highly fragile,human activities such as vegetation restoration or grazing have resulted in dramatic sandy soil changes. Grazing on vegetated sand will destroy vegetation and significantly increase soil carbon and nitrogen leakage. The grazed site had the highest emissions of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ and the highest GWP. The GHG fluxes and GWP at the mobile site were the lowest.The fixed site had the largest $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ uptake.Across the three sites, soil temperature at a depth of $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ and soil water content at a depth of $3 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ were the key micrometeorological factors determining GHG fluxes. The findings of this study ilustrate that revegetation and grazing have caused significant sandy soil changes and altered GHG fluxes and GWP. Furthermore, we determined the specific role of re-desertification caused by grazing, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of GHG fluxes in such environments to facilitate rational exploitation of desert land resources.
