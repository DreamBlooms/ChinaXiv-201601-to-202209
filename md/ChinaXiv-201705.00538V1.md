Due to the growing needs of thermal management in modern electronics，polyimide-based (PI) composites are increasingly demanded in thermal interface materials (TIMs).Graphene woven fabrics (GWFs)with a mesh structure have been prepared by chemical vapor deposition and used as thermally conductive filler.With the incorporation of 1O-layer GWFs laminates (approximate $1 2 \mathrm { \ : w t \% }$ ),the in-plane thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composite films achieves $3 . 7 3 \mathrm { W / m K } ,$ ，with a thermal conductivity enhancement of $14 1 8 \%$ compared to neat PI.However,the out-of-plane thermal conductivity of the composites is only $0 . 4 1 \mathrm { W / m K }$ .The in-plane thermal conductivity exceeds its out-of plane counterpart by over9 times,indicating a highly anisotropic thermalconduction of GWFs/PIcomposites.The thermal anisotropy and the enhanced in-plane thermal conductivity can be atributed to the layer-by-layer stacked GWFs network in PI matrix.Thus,the GWFs-reinforced polyimide films are promising for use asan efficient heat spreader for electronic cooling applications.

# 1. Introduction

Polymer-based composites have diverse applications in automobile,aerospace and electronics industries,due to their lowcost,light weight,recyclability,good processability,and enhanced physical properties compared to the polymer itself.Especially,in recent years,on account of the growing requirements of high density and speed circuits in electronic equipment,the efficient dissipation of heat generated by electronic components has caused considerable attention to avoid thermal damage to the system. In order to solve this issue,great efforts have been dedicated to improve the heat conduction performance of polymer composites [1-3].

Graphene,a one-atom-thick layer of $\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ -bonded carbon atoms [4],has been extensively studied for various applications in the recent decade [5-7],based on its ultrafast electron mobility [8], excellent mechanical strength [9],and extremely high specific surface area [1O].Besides,due to the extraordinary thermal conductivity,graphene and its derivatives have been recognized as promising fillers to fabricate polymer-matrix composites for thermal management applications[2,11].In theory,the thermal conductivity of perfect graphene could be up to $5 3 0 0 \mathrm { W / m K } ,$ which is three times higher than diamond [12].In the past few years,a variety of graphene related materials were reported to be incorporated with the polymer matrix for improving the thermal properties，such asgraphenenanoplatelets[13-15]， graphene nanosheets [16,17],and graphene oxide [18-20]. However,the reinforcing effect on the composites is still limited because of the defects of graphene,weak interfacial interaction and poor dispersion of graphene in the polymer matrix.

In contrast to commonly used methods to homogeneously disperse graphene fillers in the matrix,more recently,graphene with three-dimensional (3D) interconnected structure has gained much attention for fabrication of nanocomposites [21].3D graphene network has manyadvantages,such as relatively large surface area witha low density,and the formation of continuous thermal and electrical conduction paths [22].Currently,3D graphene structure was prepared byusing self-assembly techniques like hydrothermal [23] or sol-gel methods [24],followed by freeze-drying or super critical treatments [25-27].Alternatively,3D graphene network can be also prepared by chemical vapor deposition(CVD) method, which enables to grow graphene on Ni and Cu foams [28,29] or meshes[3o,31]as catalyst templates.Compared to those graphene derivatives made by exfoliation of graphite,CVD-grown graphene has less defects and superior thermal and mechanical properties. For example, Jia et al.reported that exceptionally high electrical conductivity of epoxy composites can be achieved by infiltrating epoxy into 3D interconnected graphene,which was grown by CVD on Ni foam [29].However, there have been onlya few works on thermally conductive polymer composites by incorporation of CVD-derived 3D graphene structure [21].

To be a matrix,polyimide (PI) has been widely investigated due to its high thermal stability,good mechanical propertiesand low dielectric constant [18,32,33]. However, the thermal conductivity of PI matrix is the order of $0 . 1 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m K }$ at room temperature [34], which cannot meet the heat dissipation requirements of modern electronic components and electrical systems.The low thermal conductivity of PI is attributed to the random orientation of molecular chains in amorphous PI region,leading to the reduction of the mean free path of heat conducting phonons [35,36].The addition of high thermally conductive fillers in thePI matrix is helpful to overcome this drawback. But,to avoid the deterioration of other properties,it still presentsa challenge to achieve a balance of high thermal conductivity and low filler content for fabricating PI composites.

In this study,we developed a PI composite incorporated with 3D graphene structure,which was constructed by lamination of graphene woven fabrics (GWFs).GWFs were fabricated by CVD growth of graphene layers on Ni woven fabrics.As a result,the incorporation of GWFs in the PI matrix shows a significant enhancement of thermal conductivity,especially along the inplane direction. The GWFs/PI composite films are promising for usingasa heat dissipation material.

# 2.Experimental

# 2.1.Materials

Ni mesh(20O mesh;purity: $9 9 . 9 \%$ )waspurchased from Hebei Hang Xu Co.,Ltd,China. The mesh is woven with the yarn of $4 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ in diameter and the grid size is $7 0 \times 7 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ Poly(amic acid) (PAA） synthesizedbypyromelliticdianhydrideand $4 , 4 ^ { \prime } \cdot$ oxydianiline was obtained from Ningbo Cen Electrical Material Co.,Ltd,China.N,N'-dimethyl acetamide(DMAc) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd,China.All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification.

# 2.2.Preparation of GWFs

CVD method was employed to grow graphene layers on the Ni surface,which was commonly used as a catalyst template for preparation of few-layer graphene [21,28,29]. Accordingly,GWFs with a similar structure of Ni mesh could be prepared by CVD,as follows:Ni mesh was first sonicated in acetic acid solution to remove the impurities and surface oxides.The mesh was then placed ina quartz tube furnace,followed by the rise of the furnace temperature at the heating rate of $1 0 \ \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C / m i n }$ with the $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ flow (8 sccm).As the temperature reached $1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ,the systemwas kept for $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ forannealing of Ni mesh.A mixture of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ (24 sccm) and $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ (8 sccm）was then introduced into the tube furnace for the catalytic growth of graphene.After reaction for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ the sample was cooled down rapidly at the cooling rate of

$2 0 0 \ \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C / m i n }$ .GWFs could be obtained after removal of Ni in the etching solution( $\mathrm { 1 0 ~ g ~ C u S O _ { 4 } }$ and $5 0 \mathrm { m l }$ HCl in $5 0 \mathrm { m l }$ DI water).

# 2.3.Fabrication of GWFs/PI composites

To fabricate GWFs/PI composite films,3D graphene structure was first prepared by layer-by-layer stacking of GWFs.1O-layer laminate of GWFs was then impregnated by PAA solution (dissolved in DMAc)，followed by degassing in vacuum.The asprepared sample was baked in a vacuum furnace at $8 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { h } }$ and at120,150,200,250,300,and $3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $^ { 1 \mathrm { h } }$ ，respectively,to complete imidization reaction.The experimental processis schematically illustrated in Fig.1.

# 2.4.Characterization

Raman spectra were obtained by Raman spectrometer with laser wavelength of $5 3 2 \mathrm { n m }$ (Renishaw plc,Wotton-under-Edge, UK).X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)was carried out with Kratos AXIS ULTR DLD spectrometer.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR） spectra were obtained usinga Nicolet 67OO FTIR(Thermal scientific Inc. USA) between 400 and $4 0 0 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ . The morphology and microstructure of GWFs and the composites were examined by optical microscope (OM,Leica DM25oo M,Germany) and scanning electron microscopy（SEM,Quanta FEG250,USA） equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS),and transmission electron microscopy(TEM,JEOL JEM-21OO,Japan),respectively.Thermal conductivities of the composites were characterized with laser flash apparatus(LFA,NETZSCH 447,Germany)at room temperature.The sample for in-plane and out-of plane measurement was round with a diameter of $2 5 . 4 \mathrm { m m }$ and $1 2 . 7 \mathrm { m m }$ ,respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis(TGA)was carried out using NETZSCH STA-449 thermo-analyzer.The temperature range was from 30 to $9 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ at a heating rate of $1 0 \ \mathrm { ^ { \circ } C / m i n }$ in nitrogen. The IR-photos werecapturedby infrared camera (Fluke,Ti4oo,USA).

# 3.Results and discussion

# 3.1.Characterizations of GWFs

A photograph of Ni mesh,graphene-deposited mesh,and a thin layerof GWFs after Ni etching,respectively,is presented in Fig.2a. The lateral size of our GWFs can be up to $3 0 \times 5 0 \mathrm { c m }$ .We found that the color of the samples turned into black from light gray after CVD growth,and then became dark gray after removal of Ni. Fig.2b shows the typical Ramanspectra taken froma single yarn(position A）and the woven joint（positionB）in GWFs,respectively.Both spectra exhibit the characteristic peaks of graphene:a sharp G-band (at $1 5 8 0 { - } 1 5 8 3 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ，astrong 2D-band (at 2697-2700 $\mathsf { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ),anda tiny D-band (at $1 3 5 1 - 1 3 5 8 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 } .$ [37].The origin of G-band is attributed to the stretching-vibration mode of $\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ sites, and 2D-band is formed of a double-resonance process [37-39]. The weak D-band,based on the bond-angle disorder due to the formation of $\mathsf { s p } ^ { 3 }$ bonds,suggests the high-quality of graphene layers grown by CVD.Moreover,according to Reina's work[4O],the intensity ratio from the 2D-band to G-band $\left( I _ { 2 \mathrm { D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } } \right)$ can be associated with the number of graphene layers.The $I _ { \mathrm { 2 D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } }$ ratio at position A is 2.25,which can be assigned to single- to bi-layer graphene [39],however,the spectra of few-layer graphene can be also found (see Fig.S1).At position,B the signal may come from graphene with more layers $\mathrm { ( } I _ { \mathrm { 2 D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } }$ ratio:1.16)because of the overlapping of two yarns.

XPS analysis is a useful tool to determine the chemical compositions of graphene layers,and able to provide information on the types of oxygen-containing functional groups on the graphene.The

XPS spectra in Fig.2c indicates that GWFs are comprised of carbon anda trace amount of oxygen;the latter may be ascribed to the adsorbed moisture or oxygen onto the surface of graphene.The absence of Ni signal at binding energies of $8 5 0 \mathrm { - } 8 7 0 \mathrm { e V }$ and in EDS spectrum (the inset of Fig.2c) suggests that Ni mesh has been completely removed after etching[41].Furthermore,asa fitting result in Fig.2d,high-resolution C1s spectrum consists of four components: $\mathsf { C } { = } \mathsf { C } / \mathsf { C } { - } \mathsf { C } \left( \mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { s p } ^ { 3 } \right.$ bonding, $2 8 4 . 6 \mathrm { e V } ,$ ,C-O(hydroxyl group, $2 8 5 . 3 \ : \mathrm { e V } \$ ） $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { C } } = 0$ (carbonyl group,286.9 V),and $\scriptstyle 0 - C = 0$ (carboxyl group, $2 8 8 . 6 \mathrm { e V }$ )[42].It shows that our GWFs contain $6 8 . 7 \%$ carbons and $3 1 . 3 \%$ oxygen-containing functional groups.

The observation in TEM(Fig.3a） shows that a single yarn in GWFs is composed of tubular graphene structure.The characteristic hexagonal diffraction pattern (the right top inset of Fig.3a) obtained at the edge of few-layer graphene in Fig.3a suggests high crystalline degree of our samples.As presented in Fig.3b and c, the wall of the tubular structure mainly consists of single-and bilayer graphene,which is in good agreement with the result of Raman spectra (Fig.2b).

The use of GWFs as fillers in the polymer composites has an additional advantage when compared to CVD-synthesized graphene flms [43-46].That is,when a stretching force is applied, the characteristic structure of GWFs allows the deformation of GWFs without the formation of cracks or fractures.As presented in Fig.4a and a GWF layer (approximate $1 0 5 \mu \mathrm { m } \dot { } ,$ ）wasfirst attached on elastic poly（dimethyl siloxane）(PDMS）substrate, and then the GWFs/PDMS sheet was uniaxially stretched at a $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ angle.In the optical microscope (OM) image of Fig.4c,we noticed that the network structure of GWFs remainsafter stretching,due the fact that the grids in GWFs could deform accordingly to release the stretching force.In Fig.4d,a comparative illustration shows the resulting morphology of a graphene film and a GWF layer deformed by applyinga stretching force.A lot of cracks would occur on the surface of mechanically stretched graphene film, whereas the network structure of GWFs is not affected.

# 3.2.The morphology of GWFs and GWFs/PI composites

GWFs/PI composite films were fabricated by impregnation of 10-layer-stacked GWFs in PAA solution,followed by thermal treatment for imidization.The morphological variation of the samples was examined and presented in Fig.5.Fig. 5a-d show the optical microscope images of pristine Ni mesh,Ni mesh after CVD growth, GWFs and GWFs/PI composites,respectively.As shown in images,

GWFs still keep the intact graphene woven fabrics structure in GWFs/PI Composites.In Fig.5e and i,the Ni mesh exhibitsa typical woven structure and a smooth surface.Fig.5f and j display the SEM images of graphene deposited on the surface of Ni mesh.The Ni surface has been completely covered with graphene layersand the wrinkles of graphene is clearly identified(see Fig.S2） after CVD growth.The formation of graphene on polycrystalline Ni by CVD is based on the non-equilibrium precipitation mechanism of carbon atoms from Ni [47].In short,during CVD,carbon atoms were generated from the decomposition of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ and then diffused into the Ni. Subsequently,during the rapid cooling process,super saturated carbon atoms inside the Ni would segregate on the Ni surface,leading to the formation of single- to few-layer graphene [48].After removal of Ni, the obtained GWFs reveal a wellpreserved mesh structure,as shown in Fig.5c.The collapse of graphene yarns (Fig.5g)and the cross-sectional SEM image of a single yarn (Fig.5k) demonstrate that GWFs are composed of tubular graphene structure,which allows PAA solution to easily flow into the inside of GWFs.TEM investigation for the microstructure of GWFs confirms the above observations of SEM images,and proves that GWFs mainly consist of single- or bilayer graphene (see Fig.3). The top-view of GWFs embedded in the PI matrix can be seen in Fig.5d and h,in addition,the cross-sectional view manifests that GWFs layers have been well incorporated in the PI matrix (Fig. 51).

# 3.3.Thermal properties of GWFs/PI composites

The thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composite films with $12 \mathrm { w t } \%$ loading of GWFs along the out-of and in-plane directions,respectively,are shown in Fig.6a.The thermal properties of neat PI are also exhibited for comparison. The thermal diffusivity $( \alpha )$ of the samples was determined by LFA at room temperature and ambient pressure.The value of thermal conductivity $( \kappa )$ could be evaluated by the equation: $\kappa = \alpha \times \rho \times C _ { p } ,$ ，where $\alpha$ is thermal diffusivity, $\rho$ is the measured density,and $C _ { p }$ is specific heat capacity of the samples [49].We found that the out-of plane thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composite films is $0 . 4 1 \mathrm { W / m K } ,$ ，which gives a slight improvement $( \approx 6 6 \% )$ ，compared to that of neat PI $( 0 . 2 5 \mathrm { W / m K } )$ .Interestingly, GWFs/PI composite films present the effective thermal conductivityenhancement （TCE） along the in-plane direction，which increases up to $14 1 8 \%$ .Thevalue of $3 . 7 3 \mathrm { W / m K }$ for the in-plane thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composite films can be achieved, with the incorporation of $12 \mathrm { w t \% }$ GWFs(1O-layer GWFs). In addition,the thermal diffusivityand thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composites containing different GWFs was shown in Fig.S4.It is clear that the thermal difusivity and thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composites increases with the incorporation of the GWFs fillers.Asa result,we conclude that GWFs/PI composite films show a highly anisotropic thermal property,with a ratio of over 9 times between out-of and in-plane thermal conductivities,which is superior to other anisotropic polymer composites filled with graphene nanoplatelets or nanoribbons [3,5O,51]. The highly anisotropic thermal conduction of GWFs/PI composites can be attributed to the particular stacking of GWFs layers in the PI matrix [5O,52].The preferred in-plane direction for heat transport is due to the formation of interconnected planar network of GWFs.In contrast,the interfacial thermal resistance between GWFs laminates is large,resulting in a lower enhancement for the out-of plane conduction. Moreover,compared to other nanofillers-filled PI composites (Table 1)，our samples achieve higher thermal conductivityat relatively low filler content,which is because of the associated benefits of high-quality graphene prepared by CVD,and the effective conduction paths based on 3D graphene structure [21,58].

The significant improvement of the in-plane thermal conductivity enables GWFs/PI composite films for use as a heat spreader for electronic cooling applications.To examine the heat dissipation performance of our composite sample,neat PI and GWFs/PI composite strips were separately connected between the heat sink and a heater. The size of each strip is $3 0 . 0 \left( \mathrm { l e n g t h } \right) \times 5 . 0$ $\mathrm { ( w i d t h ) } \times 1 . 2 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ (thickness). Inaddition,the temperature profile evolution in time of two samples was recorded usinga calibrated infrared (IR) camera.As shown in Fig.6b,IR images present the temperature increase of neat PI and GWFs/PI composites from one side to another,respectively,as a function of heating time. The temperature of two samples at the position with the same distance from the heater was determined for comparison. Before testing,thewhole systemwas keptat room temperature.As the heater temperature rose,we noticed that the temperature increase of GWFs/PI composites Was faster than that of neat PI.When the heater reached $1 8 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ ，the temperature of GWFs/PI composites was $9 9 ^ { \circ } C$ ，which increased by $1 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ than $8 6 ^ { \circ } C$ of neat PI. This result demonstrates that GWFs-reinforced PI flms have better heat dissipation performance in the real case,which is in good agreement with the higher thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composites along the in-plane direction.Meanwhile,Fig.S5 presents the excellent thermal stability of GWFs/Pl composites in comparison with the neat PI.

# 4. Conclusions

In this work,the thermally conductive PI composites have been developed with the incorporation of GWFs laminates,which exhibit better stretching allowance than continuous graphene films. The in-plane thermal conductivity of GWFs/PI composite films with $12 \mathrm { w t } \%$ GWFs loading is up to $3 . 7 3 \mathrm { W / m K } ,$ ，which increased by $14 1 8 \%$ of TCE as compared to that of neat PI.In contrast, the out-of plane thermal conductivity of the composites is $0 . 4 1 \mathrm { W } /$ mK,with an increase of TCE of only $6 6 \%$ .The thermal anisotropy and the improvement of the in-plane thermal conductivity can be ascribed to the particular stacking of high-quality GWFs in the PI matrix.The excellent thermal properties allow GWFs/PI composite films for use as an efficient heat spreader for thermal management in electronics.
