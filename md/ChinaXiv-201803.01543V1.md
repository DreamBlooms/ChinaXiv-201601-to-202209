# Abstract

Synthesis of low-cost, highly-active and durable non-platinum metal catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is always full of chalenge. Here,Ni nanoparticles modified reduced graphene oxide (Ni/rGO) as an effcient non-platinum catalyst were synthesized by laser ablation of Ni target in graphene oxide (GO) solution and the following in situ reduction process. It found that GO played an important role to restrict the growth and aggregation of ultrafine nickel colloids （2 $( < 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } ) }$ ） in the process of laser ablation. The resulting Ni/rGO catalyst showed advantageous in active sites and charge transport resulting from the small particle size,uniform dispersion and electronic effect arising from the electron interactions between reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and Ni. The obtained Ni/rGO exhibited the ultrahigh catalytic mass activity of $1 6 0 0 \mathrm { m A / m g }$ , methanol saturation concentration $( 4 \mathrm { ~ M } )$ ，which was superior to that of the reported Ni-based catalysts. Remarkably the mass activities of $\mathrm { N i / r G O }$ before and after 10oo cycles exceed that of the commercial $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalyst, indicating excellent catalytic activity and stability.

# 1:Introduction

Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs)） have atracted much attention due to a variety of advantages, such as high energy density,low operating temperature and facile electrode catalytic reactions.1 ² As the DMFC anode catalyst, traditional noble metal, especially Pt and Pt-based alloy² 4 are extensively used for electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol (MOR), whereas their high cost and poor stability hinder the practical applications .Therefore, exploring non-platinum metals with high activity and long stability has been one of the research hotspots in MOR.Among nonplatinum metal catalysts, nickel-based catalysts are considered as the most promising candidates due to the high catalytic activity and low cost of nickel. 5é Much ongoing eforts have been devoted to fabricating nickel-based catalysts in recent years, such as nickel nanoparticles modified polymer composites,§ flower-like NiO,² porous NiO film,l° astrocyte-network Ni-P-O compound.1

In order to obtain highly efficient MOR electrocatalysts，downsizing nickel composites to enhance the Ni utilization efficiency is an efective method.l For example,Knezl2 synthesized different size of NiO NPs uniform dispersion on oxygen functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by atomic layer deposition, and found the mass activity of NiO with the size of $4 . 9 \ \mathrm { n m }$ showed 2 times than the size of 6.5 nm. Wangl² found small size of Ni nanoparticles resulted in weaker adsorption of reaction intermediates on catalysts surface to affect the activity and stability. Another strategy is use appropriate supports to improve dispersion of Ni nanoparticles. I4 15 l2Guo and co-workers2 used SiC and CNT to impede nickel composites into larger aggregated nanoparticles during the thermal treatment process and confirmed the aggregation of Ni particles will decrease the electron transfer rate. Graphene has been widely used as substrate for the electrochemical catalysts because of its high surface area and excellent electrical conductivity.16 17 The inherent properties of graphene not only facilitate electron transfer 1& but also stabilize metal nanocatalysts to prevent severe aggregation. 20 According to the previous reports， nickel nanoparticles modified graphene are commonly synthesized by co-reduction of nickel salt and graphene oxide²l or the reduction of nickel salt in the presence of graphene²²， thermal decomposition of precursors2² and electrochemical deposition2. However, the large size (average size $> 7 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ） and the aggregation of synthesized Ni nanoparticles in the process of preparation preclude catalytic performance. Therefore, developing effective methods to prepare ultrafine nickel uniformly dispersed on graphene is our purpose.

In previous studies,we demonstrated that liquid phase laser ablation (LPLA） is a unique technique to synthesize ultrafine and well-dispersed NPs because of the extreme condition and subsequent quenching process. 24 25 Here, we fabricated nickel nanoparticles modified reduced graphene oxide (Ni/rGO) by laser ablation of Ni target in graphene oxide (GO) solution and the following in-situ reduction. The ultrafine $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ colloids ( $( < 5 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ ） generated by the LPLA technique were uniformly decorated on the surface of GO and maintained the original size in the following reduction. The obtained Ni/rGO had the small size ranging from $1 . 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ to $3 . 6 \ \mathrm { n m }$ of Ni nanoparticles embedded on rGO without aggregation，which is the smallest in the previous reports.The as-obtained Ni/rGO catalysts showed excellnt electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation.

# Preparation of nickel nanoparticles modified reduced graphene oxide

Ni/rGO were fabricated by liquid phase laser ablation (LPLA) technique as shown in Scheme 1, the nickel target ( $9 9 . 9 9 \%$ in purity) was fixed in a vessel filled with 15 mL O.01 M GO solution and ablated for $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ by a Nd:YAG laser with wavelength of $1 0 6 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ , pulse duration of 10 ns and per pulse laser energy of $6 0 ~ \mathrm { m J }$ .

# Materialscharacterization

A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) system (FEI Tecnai G2 F2O） with a $2 0 0  { \mathrm { ~ \textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }  { \mathrm { k V } }$ acceleration voltage was used to obtain the structural information of the products and element distribution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the collcted powder products was performed by using a Philips X'Pert system with $\mathrm { { C u - K a } }$ radiated $( \lambda = 1 . 5 4 1 9 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ ). The surface chemical states were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS,Thermo ESCACLB 250). The Ni content of the samples was measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Optima 7300 DV, America).

# ElectrochemicalMeasurements

Electrochemical measurementswere performed on Zahner electrochemical workstation (Germany） using three-electrode systems at room temperature. The reference and counter electrodeswere $\mathrm { \sf A g / A g C l }$ (3M KCl) electrode and Pt foil respectively,and the working electrode was prepared through "drop-casting" method, namely， after polishing and washing the glass carbon electrode (GCE), $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ as-prepared Ni/rGO composites dispersion was pipetted onto the treated GCE.The concentrations of nickel were obtained through ICP measurement and the total mass of the Ni was $0 . 7 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ ，After drying the electrode in ambient environment for 12 h, $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ Nafion solution were following dropped onto these electrodes and dried for another $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .Cyclic voltammetry (CV) were conducted in 1 M KOH solution with different concentrations of $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O H }$ at scan rates of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m V / s }$ . Chronoamperometry (CA） and cycling stability were conducted in $1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ KOH with 1 M $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O H }$ to assess the stability of Ni/rGO catalysts. The mass activity of Ni/rGO, which was defined as the peak current per amount of Ni loading, was commonly adopted for evaluating their electrocatalytic performances. For comparison, the commercial $\mathrm { P t / C }$ electrodes

were prepared by the same method.

# 3: Results

The general formation mechanism of Ni/rGO catalysts in our method involved two key steps: (i) as pulse laser ablating on the interface between Ni target and GO solution, a plasma plume containing Ni species (including atoms, ions,and radicals) was produced. Subsequent ultrasonic and adiabatic expansion of the plume region formed small positive charged $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ with high activity and reactivity. These positive charged $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ clusters were quickly bound by these adjacent negative charged functional groups on the surface of the GO to form $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ -GO composites through electrostatic force. 28 29 TEM of $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ -GO (Figure la and Figure 1b) confirmed that plenty of fine grain of $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ colloids ( $\because \mathrm { n m }$ ） were anchored on GO.While other nickel colloids not captured by GO grew into spherical nanoparticles through oriented aggregation and Oswald ripening (Figure 1c). XRD image of $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ -GO (Figure 1d) indicated that the $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ -GO colloid solution actually consisted of NiO and fcc Ni, which was confirmed by other related reports.3 (ii) After reduction of hydrazine hydrate, the strong reducing ability of hydrazine hydrate simultaneous ly reduced GO and $\mathrm { N i O _ { x } }$ according to the following reaction.3l After reduction of hydrazine hydrate， the diffraction peaks of NiO (Figure 1d) were disappeared indicating NiO nanoparticles were reduced to metal Ni. The diffraction peaks at $4 4 . 4 8 ^ { \circ }$ ， $5 1 . 8 3 ^ { \circ }$ and $7 6 . 3 5 ^ { \circ }$ can be indexed as the (111), (200), and (220) planes of fcc Ni (JCPDS No.01-087-0712) respectively.

(f) HR-TEM images of hollow Ni nanoparticles. (g) HR-TEM images of ultrafine Ni nanoparticles embedded into rGO. (h) C1s XPS spectra of Ni/rGO.

TEM images of the prepared Ni/rGO are shown in Figure 1e-g. As seen from TEM images (Figure le), Most of the solid NiO nanoparticles converted to the hollow nanoparticles,confirmed the above reaction mechanism. According to the previous reports,hollow structures can enhance catalytic active sites and improve mass transfer as compare to the common solid structures.² Its corresponding size distribution histograms (Figure s3a) and HRTEM image (Figure 1b) further reveal that these nanoparticles with average particles size of $7 \mathrm { n m }$ have a lattice spacing of $2 . 0 5 \mathrm { \AA }$ which corresponds to the (111) planes of fcc Ni. In the HR-TEM images of rGO (Figure 1f), large quantities of Ni nanoparticles are embedded into rGO, which also acted as bridges to connect the Ni NPs, thereby enhancing the overall electron transfer capability.3 The corresponding size distribution histograms (Figure S3b) show the size range from 1.5 to $3 . 6 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . The formation of the ultrafine Ni NPs indicate that the strong anchoring effect of rGO limit the growth of Ni NPs and prevent its agglomeration. Meanwhile, those Ni nanoparticles on rGO sheets act as spacers to prevent graphene from stacking. Therefore, the rGO nanosheets play an important role in limiting the growth of Ni NPs.

Elemental composition and valence state on the surface of Ni/rGO were further confirmed by XPS,as shown in Figure 1f. High-resolution C1s spectrum of Ni/rGO shows three main peaks correspond to carbon atoms with diferent oxidation states. These peaks located at the binding energies of 284.5, 286.6 and $2 8 8 . 4 \ \mathrm { e V }$ are assigned to C-C in aromatic rings, C-O (hydroxyl and 1,2-epoxide functionalities), $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { C = O } }$ (carboxyl and ketone functionalities） groups, respectively. 34 35 Compared with the XPS spectra of GO (Figure S4),an obvious decrease in the intensity of oxygen-containing functional groups indicates that an effective reduction reaction of GO happened after adding hydrazine hydrate. In Ni $2 { \tt p } _ { 3 / 2 }$ spectrum (Figure S5), a peak located at 852.0 $\mathrm { e V }$ corresponds to $\mathrm { N i ^ { \mathrm { 0 } } }$ ,while another peak at $8 5 5 . 8 \mathrm { e V }$ is ascribed to NiO, indicating the surface of Ni are mostly oxidized when Ni/rGO lost the protection of hydrazine hydrate to expose in the air. According to the above results analysis, metal Ni nanoparticles modified rGO were successfully

The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared Ni/rGO towards methanol oxidation was initially investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) in $1 \mathrm { M K O H } + 1 \mathrm { M C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O H }$ According to the literature, the electro-oxidation mechanism of methanol on the Ni-based catalyst is according to the followed progress: 12 36

$$

$$

$\mathrm { N i O O H + C H _ { 3 } O H {  } N i ( O H ) _ { 2 } + }$ oxidation products of methanol (5)

As we can see in equation (5), the formation of NiOOH is the decisive step for electro-oxidation of methanol on Ni-based materials.Thus, before the electrocatalytic activity tests, $\mathrm { N i / r G O }$ catalyst was conditioned by CV over 5O cycles at a scan rate of $5 0 \mathrm { m V / s }$ in 1 M KOH to enrich hydroxides and oxyhydroxides on the surface of the catalyst, which results in thickening of the electrocatalytic layers.36 A pair of redox peaks corresponding to the $\mathrm { N i ^ { 2 + } / N i ^ { 3 + } }$ redox couple (Figure 2a) is reported to be 0.44 & 0.3V vs $\mathrm { \sf A g / A g C l }$ ,respectively.& I In the presence of $1 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ methanol (Figure 2a),an intense anodic peak in the forward scan at $0 . 6 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ suggest the enhanced catalytic activity for MOR. The ultrahigh mass activity of $1 6 0 0 \mathrm { \ m A / m g }$ is not only superior to the previously reported Ni-based catalysts (Table 1),but also higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalysts $9 2 5 \ \mathrm { m A / m g }$ ，Figure 2b). Meanwhile,another minor anodic peak in the reverse scan is attributed to the oxidation of adsorbed intermediate species produced in the forward sweep, indicating the good anti-poisoning properties of $\mathrm { { N i / r G O } }$ catalyst.10 37 Figure 2c shows the effect of scan rate on methanol oxidation at Ni/rGO in $1 \mathrm { M K O H } + 1 \mathrm { M C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O H }$ .The linear dependence of anodic peak currents on the square root of scan rates (Figure S5a) shows the electrocatalytic reaction as a diffusion controlled process at 1M $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O H }$ . Furthermore,Ni/rGO retains the linear growth even at a high scan of $1 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m V / s }$ ，which benefits from the ultrafine Ni nanoparticle into on rGO, hollow structure of Ni and the large surface area of rGO,which are benefit for electro species to diffuse efficiently between electrolyte and surface active sites on Ni/rGO.

Apart from the catalytic mass activity， the concentration of methanol is another index to determine the performance of MOR.As high concentration methanol solution could dramatically decrease the size of the fuel cell and simultaneously increase the power density.38 Unfortunately, most of the preceding Ni-based catalysts have been reported use lower concentrations of methanol such as $0 . 5 { \mathrm { ~ M ~ } }$ 0 $2 \mathrm { M }$ methanol. 37 36 1 Interestingly, in the present study,the peak current density increases linearly with methanol concentration up to $4 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ (Figure 2d and Figure S5b), indicating the diffusion of reaction species is the rate-limiting step.When the methanol concentration exceed this limit, the oxidation current density keep constant demonstrating the rate-limiting step is changed to a reaction-kinetics-controlled process and its rate are mainly determined by the catalytic reaction rate of the electrode. The prepared Ni/rGO catalysts exhibit saturation concentration of methanol up to $4 \mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ ，which is the highest concentration ever to be reported, especially for Ni-based catalysts for methanol electro-oxidation.

To evaluate the electrochemical stability, the chronoamperometry (CA） tests and cycling test of the prepared Ni/rGO and commercial $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalysts were carried out in 1 M KOH solution with 1 M $\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O H }$ . Figure 3a shows the CA curves for methanol of $\mathrm { N i / r G O }$ catalyst at $0 . 6 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ and the commercial $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalyst at -0.22V for $3 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { s } .$ ，The Ni/rGO catalyst maintains obviously higher current densities than commercial $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalyst during the whole test, indicating a higher poisontolerance to absorbed intermediates generated during the methanol oxidation processes.l Figure 3b,c show CV curves of the $\mathrm { N i / r G O }$ composite and commercial $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalysts at different cycles respectively. Although the decay of the mass activity of the Ni/rGO composite $( 6 7 . 2 \% )$ ）is much faster than that of $\mathrm { P t / C }$ （ $7 4 . 8 1 \% )$ ，the $\mathrm { N i / r G O }$ composite maintain super mass activity of 1012 $\mathrm { { \ m A / m g } }$ even after 1000 cycles whereas that of $\mathrm { P t / C }$ just keep $6 9 2 ~ \mathrm { { m A / m g } }$ (Figure 3d). The TEM images of the Ni/rGO after cycling tests (Fig. S7, ESIt) show that the Ni nanoparticles keep the original morphology and free of agglomeration, indicating that the active site of Ni is stable during the reaction process and successfully explain its outstanding durability.

Generally speaking, the prepared Ni/rGO is a superior catalytic for methanol with high mass activity of $1 6 0 0 \mathrm { m A / m g }$ ， good anti-poisoning properties, fast reaction kinetics and high saturation concentration of methanol. The superior catalytic performances result from the unique structure and high dispersity of Ni nanoparticles on rGO (TEM images (Fig.le-g), which provide abundant the reaction sites for the oxidation of methanol promoting the complete oxidation of methanol.39 Moreover, some ultrafine Ni nanoparticles with the size of $1 . 5 { - } 3 . 6 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ are embedded into rGO and converted to the active site NiOOH anchoring on the surface of rGO，which prevent Ni nanoparticles from aggregation during the reaction. Furthermore, the excellent mass and electron transportation performance of rGO would like to diffuse fast between electrolyte and surface active sites on $\mathrm { N i / r G O }$ to facilitate the operation of the reaction.As a result, the $\mathrm { N i / r G O }$ catalyst exhibit excellent performance for the electro-oxidation of methanol.

# Conclusions

In this work,we fabricated Ni/rGO catalysts as a highly efficient toward MOR in alkaline condition.The obtained Ni/rGO exhibited an impressively high electrocatalytic activity, good antipoisoning properties, fast reaction kinetics and high concentration of methanol $( 4 ~ \mathrm { M } )$ . The super performance could be attributed to the unique structures of Ni nanoparticles especially the ultrafine Ni nanoparticles ( $1 . 5 \ \mathrm { n m } - 3 . 6 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ), stable structure during the reaction and the exc ellent electron transportation of rGO.The facile， cost-effectivenesspreparation of non-noble metal/graphene with the high activity is significant for the sustainable development.
