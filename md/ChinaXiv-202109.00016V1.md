Abstract: Barchan dunes are among the most common accumulative phenomena made by wind erosion, which are usualy formed in regions where the prevailing wind direction is almost constant throughout the year and there is not enough sand to completely cover the land surface. Barchans are among the most common windy landscapes in Pashoueyeh Erg in the west of Lut Desert, Iran.This study aims to elaborate on morphological properties of barchans in this region using mathematical and statistical models. The results of these methods are very important in investigating barchan shapes and identifying their behavior. Barchan shapes were mathematicaly modeled by simulating them in the coordinate system through nonlinear parabolic equations,so that two separate equations were calculated for barchan windward and slip-face parabolas. The type and intensity of relationships between barchan morphology and mathematical parameters were determined by the statistical modeling. The results indicated that the existing relationships followed the power correlation with the maximum coeficient of determination and minimum error of estimate. Combining the above two methods is a powerful basis for stimulating barchans in virtual and laboratory environments.The most important result of this study is to convert the mathematical and statistical models of barchan morphology to each other. Focal length is one of the most important parameters of barchan parabolas, suggesting different states of barchans in comparison with each other. As the barchan's focal length decreases,its opening becomes narrower,and the divergence of the barchan's horns reduces. Barchans with longer focal length have greater width,dimensions,and volume.In general, identifying and estimating the morphometric and planar parameters of barchans is effective in how they move,how much they move,and how they behave in the environment. These cases play an important role in the management of desert areas.

# 1 Introduction

The shape of aeolian sand dunes is determined by the directionality of the sand and wind availability (Cooke et al.,1993; Alvarez and Franklin, 2019). Basically, the wind can shape sand dunes by erosion and deposition processes (Hersen,2Oo5).When the sand supply is low and the wind is unidirectional or flat, crescentic dunes which are called barchans appear and move along the wind direction (Engel et al., 2018). Barchans have a crescent-shaped morphology with two horns pointing in the wind direction (Zhang et al.,2O18). Barchans observed in nature are found in many diferent sizes. These crescent-shaped dunes are usually display an asymmetric shape with the width larger than the length (Tsoar and Parteli, 2O16).In the process of transformation and evolution of barchan dunes,it is assumed that the initial accumulation of sands forms parabolic dunes. If the height of parabolic dunes reaches a certain critical value,their appearance looks instable and a slippery mass is formed on the barchan slip-face.As the height increases,the dune becomes more stable (Kocurek et al., 1992). However, barchan dunes continue to grow and move (Sauermann et al.,2ooo). During the movements and transformations, these dunes maintain their parabolic and three-dimensional shape along with increasing the volume and size until they reach complete stability. In general, each barchan is composed of the intersection of three separate parabolas with different characteristics. Each parabola individually has a focus, vertex, directrix,and separate equation. The first or outer parabola indicates the maximum expansion of the windward slope,the middle or second parabola represents the barchan's brink,and the third parabola indicates the maximum expansion of the leeward slope. Parabola is a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point,called focus,and a fixed line,called directrix (Leithold,1992). Nature barchans show various forms of geometric shapes, and the appearance and morphology of which can be modeled in mathematics through linear and nonlinear functions and mathematical equations. Barchan dunes are real manifestations of parabolic geometric shapes,to which the mathematical rules of parabola can be applied, and their appearance can be modeled through nonlinear functions and parabolic equations.This analogy helps researchers better identify these phenomena and their performance in the nature and accurately understand their behavior in management based on the systemic approach of desert areas. Barchan mathematical modeling using parabolic equations helps to determine the exact area under the parabolic curve,which can be used to calculate surface components of barchans such as environment and area.

Morphometric calculations of barchan dunes and the morphological relationships between them were first performed by Bagnold (1941) and Finkel (1959) in southern Peru. Lettau and Lettau (1969) also developed a simple geometric pattern consisting of elliptical and parabolic shapes and straight lines to stimulate a standard barchan dune using the height, width,and length of the barchan and calculated the volume of sand dunes. In general, many researchers have used numerical simulations to predict the movement and evolution of barchans dunes and their morphology (Landsberg，1956; Howard and Morton， 1978； Anton and Vincent, 1986; Wippermann and Gross, 1986; Anthonsen et al., 1996; Sauermann et al., 2000; Hersen, 2004; Mousavi et al.,2010; Duran et al.,2011; Hamdan et al.,2016; Yang et al.,2019). Also, Hesp and Hastings (1998)，by examining the relationships between the morphological parameters of barchans, introduced these relationships as factors controlling the three-dimensional shape of barchans. Sauermann et al. (2ooo) studied barchan dunes in southern Morocco using three-dimensional parabolic equations and proposed a model for the barchan shape based on which the differences between barchans and their stability can be defined. Wang et al. (2007) investigated barchan dunes in northwestern China through geometric theories and stated that the barchan height was proportional to its width and the brink can be described by a parabolic shape. Also,Zhang et al. (2018) studied the migration and morphology of asymmetric barchans in Northwest China, and the results showed that morphometric relations that are predicted from models for steady-state, symmetric crescent-shaped dunes can be applied to different transitional morphologies of interacting, asymmetric barchans.

The present study aims to investigate the morphometric and planar features of barchan dunes in the selected region using mathematical modeling，quantitative measurement methods,and parabolic equations. This study presents quadratic equations for barchan parabolas to better identify their behavior, performance,and morphometric and planar properties in the nature.

Therefore，barchans'horizontal sections are first examined to see if they folow parabolic equations and, then, the components of these equations are modeled using geometric properties of barchans.A combination of statistical and mathematical modeling is employed to study the shape of barchans. These equations are useful for defining the morphometric and planar indices of barchans,simulating them in virtual and laboratory environments,and accurately identifying their behavior and morphodynamic features.

# 2.1 Study area

The Pashoeyeh Erg is located in the west of Lut Desert, eastern part of Kerman Province, Iran. It is situated along the northwest-southeast in the east of Kalouts of Lut Desert, with the elevation of $9 7 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ above the sea level. The field under this study (Pashoeyeh Erg) is situated between latitudes $2 9 ^ { \circ } 5 5 ^ { \prime } - 3 0 ^ { \circ } 2 1 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ and longitudes $5 7 ^ { \circ } 5 0 ^ { \prime } { - } 5 8 ^ { \circ } 1 0 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E }$ Lut Desert is one of the most important deserts in Iran.This desert is among the driest and hotest deserts in Iran and in the world, with an annual precipitation of less than $5 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ ；it islikely that no rain falls there even for several consecutive years.Table 1 shows the characteristics of climatic parameters in the study area.

According to the results of Table 1, in the four months of the year, i.e., July, August, September, and October, there was no rainfall in the study area. Accordingly, the highest precipitation in February was $9 . 9 0 \ \mathrm { m m }$ . Also, July with an average temperature of $4 1 . 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was the warmest month and January with an average temperature of $1 3 . 7 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was the coldest month in this region. The highest humidity was $3 6 . 9 0 \%$ in January and the lowest was $12 . 0 \%$ in July. The analysis of the wind-rose diagram of Shahdad synoptic station in the northwest of the study area shows that the prevailing wind direction in the study area is from north (data not shown). The maximum wind speed in this direction is $1 1 . 1 1 \mathrm { m / s }$

# 2.2 Parameter measurements and data analysis

The study area was investigated by using satellite images of Google Earth. Field sampling was performed along ten transects that covered almost the entire study area and morphometric and planar parameters of barchans were measured along each transect (Table 2). The sample size depends on the number of barchans located in the area of transects. In total, 5O barchans were evaluated. In other words,based on field sampling，5O barchans overlapped with the ten mentioned transects.

Morphometric and planar parameters of barchans were measured to statistically investigate their characteristics. Figure 1 shows morphometric and planar parameters of barchans and the way they were measured.

Fig.1A schematic representation of barchan's morphometric and planar parameters (Hesp ans Hastings,1998; Sauermann et al.,20oo; Daniell and Hughe,2007). $L o$ ,length of the windward side; $L s$ ,length of the slip-face; $L _ { a } .$ length of the right horn; $L _ { b }$ ,length of the left horn; ${ \cal { W } } _ { a } ,$ width of the right side; $\mathrm { W } _ { b } ,$ width of the left side. The yellow color indicates the windward side,the orange color indicates the slip-face of the barchan,and the gray color indicates the barchan.

The total length and width of barchans were calculated using Equations l and 2,respectively:

$$
L = L o + L s + \frac { ( L _ { a } + L _ { b } ) } { 2 } ,
$$

$$
W _ { \mathrm { \scriptsize ~ = } } W _ { \mathrm { \scriptsize ~ _ { a } } } + W _ { \mathrm { \scriptsize ~ _ { b } } } ,
$$

where $L$ is the total length of the barchans $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ · $L _ { \mathrm { a } }$ is the length of the right horn (m); $L _ { b }$ is the length of the left horn (m); $L o$ is the length of the windward side $( \mathrm { m } ) ; L s$ is the length of the slip-face (m); $W$ is the total width of the barchan (m); ${ \cal { W } } _ { a }$ is the width of the right side $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ ; and $\boldsymbol { W } _ { b }$ is the width of the left side $\mathrm { ( m ) }$

To calculate the perimeter and area of the barchan， we first considered a hypothetical coordinate system for each barchan on the ground. Then，coordinates of 2l points were determined on its perimeter. The sampled points were plotted on a graph paper at a scale of 1:100. Then, the area and perimeter of each barchan were calculated using a planimeter and curvimeter, respectively. Considering that the barchan's volume was half of the pyramid's volume (Hesse, 2008),we determined the volume of sediments using Equation 3 after calculating the barchan's area.

$$
V = 0 . 1 6 6 6 S \times H ,
$$

where $V$ is the volume of the barchan $( \mathbf { m } ^ { 3 } )$ ; and $S$ and $H$ are the area $( \mathbf { m } ^ { 2 } )$ and height $\mathrm { ( m ) }$ of the barchan,respectively. The volumes of all the barchans were calculated and, finally, the volume vector of the barchan was formed.Therefore,the height,length and its parameters, width and its parameters, perimeter,area,and volume of wind-eroded sediments were calculated for all the 50 barchans, and data matrices were prepared for modeling.

To model the studied barchan parabolas，we selected 2O barchans out of the 50-member population of barchans using the probability sampling method (simple random sampling). Then, based on the 21 points selected on the ground, we plotted these 2O barchans on a graph paper at a scale of 1:1O0. To mathematically model them using the parabolic equation，we plotted a hypothetical coordinate system for each of the barchans, the $x$ -axis and $y$ -axis of which were parallel to the wind direction and perpendicular to the wind direction， respectively. The coordinate system was plotted in such a way that the barchan's opening and its parabolas were placed on the right side.In this coordinate system, the $x \cdot$ -axis corresponded to the symmetry line of the barchan and windward,so that the coordinates of the vertex of the windward slope parabola also corresponded to the origin of the coordinate system (Fig. 2). Then, by grading the axes of the coordinate system in millimeter at a scale of 1:1Oo,the coordinates of the end points of the barchan's horns were determined. Finally,given that parabolas opened to the right, the barchan windward slope parabola was modeled using the following parabola equation:

$$
y ^ { 2 } = 4 p ( x ) .
$$

In this equation, $4 p$ is the length of the side perpendicular to the parabola's focus,and $x$ and $y$ are the length and width of the constituent points of parabolas,respectively. This equation is applied when the parabola's vertex is located at coordinates $( 0 , \ 0 )$ ，i.e.,in the center of the coordinate system. In this case, the focus has coordinates $( 0 , p )$ ,the directrix equation is $x { = } - p$ ， and the parabola's symmetry line is the $x$ -axis.Considering the coordinate system described, these conditions indicated the barchan windward slope parabola whose equation can be easily calculated (Fig. 2).

Fig.2Image of a barchan with its parabolas and components in the coordinate system.In this image, $o$ is the origin of the coordinate system, $F$ is the coordinates of the focus, $S$ is the coordinates of the parabola's vertex $p$ is the distance between the focus and vertex,and $G$ is the directrix of the parabola.

The barchan slip-face slope parabola was also modeled in the same coordinate system by transferring the axis to the vertex of the barchan slip-face parabola using Equation 5; however, this equation was based on the coordinate system,and the origin of which was the vertex of the windward slope parabola (Fig. 2).

$$
\left( y - k \right) ^ { 2 } = 4 p ( x - h ) ,
$$

where $h$ is the vertex of the slip-face parabola; and $k$ is the vertex of the slip-face parabola.

This equation is applicable when the parabola's vertex has coordinates other than $( 0 , 0 )$ . In this case,the axis should be transferred to calculate the parabolic equation. Therefore, according to its length and width (i.e., $k$ and $h$ ,respectively), $h$ is subtracted from $x$ and $k$ is subtracted from $y$ in the parabolic equation. In this way, the axis was transferred and the leward slope parabolic equation was calculated. Finally, Equation 4 became Equation 5,representing that the vertex of the leward parabola is located at a point with coordinates $( k , h )$ and the equation is $h$ units away from the $x$ -axis and $k$ units away from the $y .$ -axis in the positive direction.

In this case,the coordinates of the parabola's focus were calculated by the following equation:

$F ( h { + } p , k )$ ，where $F$ is the coordinates of the focus, $p$ is the distance between the focus and vertex, and the directrix equation was obtained by $\scriptstyle x = h - p$ .Using this method, the equation of barchan slip-face parabola and other related properties can be modeled. Given that the vertex of the windward slope parabola corresponds to the vertex of the axis of the coordinates, $h$ and $k$ values are equal to zero.However, these values are different in the slip-face parabola, because its vertex is located on the $x \cdot$ -axis and away from the $y \mathrm { . }$ -axis, so that $k$ value is equal to zero and $h$ value is equal to its distance from the $y$ -axis (Fig. 2).

Overall, the coordinates of the parabola's vertex and the end points of the horns were determined for allthe 2O barchans studied,and the parabolic equations, coordinates of the focus, directrix equation, and $p$ values were calculated for each of them.After modeling the studied barchan parabolas mathematically and calculating $p$ values and coefficient $x$ to identify the type of relationship and the extent of effect of these two parameters on the morphometric and planar parameters of barchans, the relationship between these parameters was evaluated using SPSS software and regression analysis. For this purpose，simple linear and nonlinear regression methods were first tested. In simple regression method, various relationships including linear, power, logarithmic,and cubic were assessed among different parameters and those with higher preference value (higher coeficient of determination and lower standard error of estimate) were selected.In other words,in this method,the best relationships are those that follow power functions.

Therefore,only simple power correlations are mentioned in the following section and, finally, correlation coefficient， coefficient of determination， adjusted coefficient of determination, standard error of estimate,and significance level of relationships are presented to identify the type of relationship and the extent of its impact.

The parabolic shape is among the most important morphometric and planar properties of barchans, which is itself influenced by barchan's crescent and aerial morphology (Sauermann et al., 2000). Therefore, parabolic quadratic equations can be used for mathematical modeling of barchans. In other words, it is possible to model two-dimensional surfaces of barchans (regardless of their spatial features) through parabolic equations (Anthonsen et al.,1996). For mathematical modeling of barchans, the coordinate system was designed in a way that barchan parabolas opened to the right in the wind direction. The vertex of the windward slope parabola corresponded to the origin of the coordinate system and the $x \cdot$ -axis was parallel to the wind direction and the symmetry line of barchans. Therefore,the coordinates of the vertex and the focus of parabolas were positive,and their values in the coordinates of the focus and vertexes of all barchan parabolas were constant.

However, the $p$ value and coefficient $x$ in the equation of each barchan were different from the adjacent barchans.Directrix in all barchans was parallel to the $y$ -axis. The $p$ value or the focal length of the parabola and the value of coefficient $x$ in the parabolic equation are among the important parameters in calculating the parabolic equation of a barchan dune to study its morphology. These two components represent different states of parabolas,so that as the $p$ value decreases, the focal length and the value of coefficient $x$ also reduce. As a result, as these values decrease， the focus becomes closer to the vertex； the barchan's opening narrows and, consequently,the divergence of the barchan's horns decreases. In the other case,the opposite happens.

In a barchan consisting of three separate parabolas, the windward slope parabola has a lower $p$ value,and this value increases in the other two parabolas,i.e.,the windward slope parabola has the lowest $p$ value and the slip-face parabola has the highest $p$ value. As a result, the degree of divergence of parabolic horns increases from the windward slope to the slip-face with increasing $p$ value and coefficient $x$ . Therefore, the windward slope parabola has the lowest degree of divergence compared to the slip face parabola,and the slip-face parabola has the highest degree of divergence. In barchan dunes,the longer the distance between the focus and vertex is,the greater the barchan's focal length and width will be. If the opposite happens,the barchan's width decreases and its length increases,which changes its shape. In general, barchans with longer focal length have greater width, dimensions, and volume.

Table 4 shows the results of mathematical modeling of the studied barchans using parabolic equations,in which $p$ value, directrix equation, parabolic equation, coordinates of the focus,and coordinates of the vertex are presented.Table 5 presents the correlations between the focal length of the windward slope parabola and the morphometric and planar parameters of barchans in the study area.

The analysis of the correlation between the focal length of the windward slope parabola and other morphometric and planar parameters of the barchan indicated that there was a maximum significant power correlation of the focal length of the windward slope parabola with the barchan's area and volume, with the coefficients of determination of 0.989 and O.984,respectively, and the estimation erors of 0.148 and 0.250, respectively (Table 5). Next to the parameters of area and volume,the width of the barchan had the third highest correlation with the focal length, with the coefficient of determination of 0.970 and the estimation error of O.156.Also,the minimum significant power correlation was observed between the focal length of the windward slope parabola and the barchan's length,with a coefficient of determination of 0.952 and an estimation error of 0.311 (Fig.3). Next to the length parameter, the perimeter of the barchan had the second least correlation with the focal length,with the coeffcient of determination of 0.957 and the estimation error of 0.247.

The analysis of the correlation between the focal length of the slip-face parabola and other morphometric and planar parameters of the barchan indicated that there was a maximum significant power correlation of the focal length of the slip-face parabola and the barchan's width and area,with the coefficients of determination of 0.797 and O.785,respectively,and the estimation errors of 0.497 and 0.650,respectively (Table 6).

Next to the parameters of area and width, the volume of the barchan had the third highest correlation with the focal length of the slip-face parabola with the coefficients of determination of 0.772 and the estimation errors of 0.934. Also, the minimum significant power correlation was observed between the focal length of the slip-face parabola and the barchan's length,with a coefficient of determination of O.705 and an estimation error of 0.887. Next to the length parameter,the height of the barchan had the second least correlation with the focal length of the slip-face parabola, with the coefficient of determination of 0.732 and the estimation errors of 0.288 (Fig. 4).

# 4 Conclusions

In this study,two statistical and mathematical modeling methods were combined to investigate the morphometric and planar parameters of barchan dunes.The planar coordinates of barchan's parameters can be obtained using parabolic equation, mathematical modeling of barchans,and the intersection of two windward slope and slip-face parabolas. The morphometric and planar parameters of barchans can be calculated through statistical modeling of their geometric properties,and their properties can be justified by regression analysis. Therefore,the results of this study provide the possibility for accurate and rapid estimation of the morphometric and planar parameters of barchans.The evaluation of the focal length in the studied barchans shows that the maximum and minimum focal lengths in the sampled barchans are 72.22 and $8 . 6 9 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ respectively. The results of correlation analysis between the focal length and the morphometric and planar parameters of barchans indicate that, the focal length of the windward side parabola and the area of the barchan shows the highest correlation, with the coefficient of determination being of 0.989 and the estimation error of 0.148;while the length of the barchan has the least correlation with the focal length of the windward side parabola，with the coefficient of determination being of 0.952 and the estimation error of 0.311. The results of this simulation are of great significance for calculating the area of barchans under the curve and the perimeter and area occupied by the barchans in the nature.
