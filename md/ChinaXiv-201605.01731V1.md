GADD45A is a TP53-regulated and DNA damage-inducible tumor suppresor protein, which regulates cell cycle arrest,apoptosis,andDNA repair,and inhibits tumor growthandangiogenesis.However,the functionofGDD45A in autophagy remains unknown.In this report, we demonstrate that GADD45A plays an important role in regulating the process of autophagy. GADD45A is able to decrease LC3-ll expression and numbers of autophagosomes in mouse tissues and different cancer cell lines. Using bafilomycin $\mathsf { A } _ { 1 }$ treatment,we have observed that GADD45A regulates autophagosome initiation.Likely,GADD45A inhibitionofautophagy is through itsinfluenceon the interactionbetween BECN1 and PIK3C3.Immunoprecipitationand GST afinityisolation assys exhibit that GADD45A directly interacts with BECN1,and in turn dissociates the BECN1-PlK3C3 complex.Furthermore, we have mapped the 71 to 81 amino acids of the GADD45A protein that are necessary for the GADD45A interaction with BECN1. Knockdown of BECN1 can abolish autophagy alterations induced by GADD45A.Taken together,these findings provide the novel evidence that GADD45A inhibits autophagy via impairing the BECN1-PlK3C3 complex formation.

# Introduction

Autophagy,a lysosome-dependent protein degradation pathway in eukaryocyte,is essential for cell survival，growth and homeostasis. Autophagy begins with a phagophore,I,2² followed by the phagophore expansion to engulf intracellular cargo,such as protein aggregates,organelles and ribosomes,thereby sequestering the cargo in a double-membrane autophagosome.³ The autophagosome eventually fuses with the lysosome, promoting the degradation of autophagosomal contents by lysosomal acid proteases.³ It has also been reported that autophagy plays important roles in oncogenesis,which depends on cancer types and stages.46 On the one hand,autophagy inhibitsoncogenesis in certain types of cancer.7-9 On the other hand, some cancer cells can utilize activated autophagy to ameliorate deficiencies in nutrition and oxygen,caused byrapidfissonand ischemia.1-12

BECN1/Beclinl,an ortholog of Vps30/Atg6 in yeast, is a central component in autophagy and also plays crucial roles in development， tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration.7 Interestingly, BECN1 was initially discovered not as an autophagy protein but rather as an interaction partner for the antiapoptotic protein BCL2.13 Autophagy and apoptosis， 2 self-destructive processes, have a complicated functional relationship.14 It has been demonstrated that common upstream signals can induce either apoptosis or autophagy in a context-dependent fashion.One wellcharacterized regulatory factor in autophagy is BCL2,which interacts with BECN1 and disrupts the interaction of BECN1 with PIK3C3.14.15ROS favors proapptotic mitochondralouter membrane permeabilization (MOMP) as well as stimulates the proteolyticactivityof ATG4, therebystimulating autophagy.16,17 Accumulating evidence suggests that TP53 (note that the mouse nomenclature is TRP53,but we use TP53 hereafter to refer to both the human and mouse genes/proteins for simplicity),a quintessential tumor suppressor and apoptosis inducer, regulates autophagy in a 2-faced fashion.18-21On theone hand, TP53 functions as a nuclear transcription factor and transactivates proapoptotic,cell cycle-arresting and proautophagic genes. On the other hand, cytoplasmic TP53 can operate at mitochondria to promote cell death and can repress autophagy via poorly characterized mechanisms.19,22

GADD45A,a TP53-regulated and DNA-damage responsive protein,is induced by varieties of genotoxic stress agents,such as UV radiation (UVR),ionizing radiation (IR),alkylating agents and hydroxyurea.23-28A number of investigations indicatethat GADD45A can induce cell cycle arrest,29 apoptosis,30 DNA damage repair31and angiogenesis inhibition.32 Increasing evidence shows high frequency mutations or abnormal epigenetic modifications of GADD45A in pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer.33-35 In vivo experiments have demonstrated that gadd45a knockout mice are susceptible to DNA-damage inducibletumors.36Thus GADD45A isanimportanttumor-suppressor gene. GADD45A is involved in the induction of apoptosis through inducing BCL2L11/Bim dissociation from the cytoskeleton and translocation to mitochondria. However,the possible functions and molecular mechanisms of GADD45A in autophagy are poorly understood.

In this report,we investigated the role of GADD45A in the regulation of autophagic system and found that GADD45A inhibited autophagy through impairing the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex. Furthermore，we observed that GADD45A interacted with BECN1 and disrupted the interaction between BECN1 and PIK3C3. The region harboring amino acids 71 to 81 of GADD45A was necessary and sufficient for interaction with BECN1. These findings demonstrate the negative role and the specific mechanism of GADD45A in autophagy.

# Results

# Deletion of GADD45A causes extensive autophagy

To explore the roles of GADD45A in the control of autophagy，gadd45a knockout mice $( g a d d 4 5 a ^ { - / - } )$ ）were employed. We first examined the amounts ofLC3 protein,an indicator of autophagic activity,in several organs including liver, lung and kidney using a LC3B-specific polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig ure 1A, an approximately $1 8 ~ \mathrm { { k D a } }$ band representing LC3-I was observed in all preparations and there was a pronounced increase in the autophagosome-associated lipidation form LC3-I with apparent molecular mass of $1 6 ~ \mathrm { { k D a } }$ in the $g a d d 4 5 a ^ { - / - }$ mouse organs, compared with $G a d d 4 5 a ^ { + / + }$ mice (Fig. 1B). The expression levels of SQSTM1,a cargo receptor for degradation of damaged or long-lived proteins that is often used as a protein marker of autophagy，were also evidently lower in $g a d \bar { d } \bar { 4 } 5 a ^ { - / - }$ mouse organs than that seen in Gadd45a+/+ ，suggestingthat GADD45A might inhibit the autophagy process.Furthermore, we analyzed the numbers of autophagosomes by confocal microscopy assays in liver cells. There were large amounts of small bright green granular substances in gadd4 $4 \bar { 5 } a ^ { - / - }$ mice liver cells, while only a few puncta were seen in the normal control (Fig. 1C, 1D).

Next，we tested the expression of LC3 and SQSTM1 in $G a d d 4 5 a ^ { + / + }$ and $g a d d \bar { 4 } \bar { 5 } \bar { a } ^ { - / - }$ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)and found that LC3-II-specific proteins dramatically increased and SQSTM1 decreased expression in the gadd45a MEFs (Fig.1E,1F). Similarly,when the numbers of LC3 puncta per cell were scored, bright green LC3 punctate signals were significantly observed in the cytoplasm of the gadd45a-/- MEFs (Fig.1G,1H). These data clearly highlight a speculation that autophagosome formation is inhibited by GADD45A.

# GADD45A levels negatively associates with the number of autophagosomes in tumor cells

To further investigate the association between the GADD45A level and autophagy，we generated GADD45A-stably-silenced clones with shRNA in KYSE30 cells and transiently knocked down GADD45A by RNA interference (RNAi) in KYSE150 cells.Real-time PCR and western blot results showed that the expression of GADD45A was significantly downregulated as shown in Figure S1.Downregulation of GADD45A resulted in an increased expression of LC3-II and a decreased expression of SQSTM1,compared with the control (Fig.2A,2B). In addition, large amounts of small bright green granular substances were observed in the GADD45Aknockdown cells,whereas evenly distributed green LC3 signals with a few puncta were seen in the control (Figs.2C,2D，S2)．These results indicate that the reduced expression of GADD45A leads to an increased number of autophagosomes.

We also produced overexpression of GADD45A in $2 9 3 \mathrm { T }$ HeLa and EC9706 cells transfected with the MYC-GADD45A vector. Compared with thecontrol， overexpressionof GADD45A suppressed LC3-II expression and induced SQSTM1 expression,which is an opposite effect to the GADD45A knockdown cells (Fig.2E,2F).Confocal microscopy assays also showed that the numbers of autophagosomes in GADD45Aoverexpressing cells were decreased (Figs.2G,2H, S3),indicating that elevated expression of GADD45A inhibits the formation of autophagosomes.Taken together，these results corroborate that GADD45A is negatively associated with the formation of autophagosomes in tumor cells.

# GADD45A blocks autophagic flux

Autophagy is a highly dynamic and multistep process,which can be modulated at several steps.An accumulation of autophagosomes could reflect the induction of autophagy or the reduction in autophagosome turnover.37 Bafilomycin $\mathbf { A } _ { 1 }$ (Baf),a small molecule inhibitor of autophagy,induces the accumulation of autophagosomes through blocking the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes.Baf treatment,which isa well-established method for monitoring autophagosome synthesis,can be used to reveal the mechanism of autophagosome accumulation.We then examined the expression of LC3-II in GADD45A knockdown cells treated with Baf and found that depletion of GADD45A resulted in increasedLC3-II levels inKYSE30 and KYSE150 cells following Baf treatment, compared with the control cells treated with Baf (Fig.3A,3B). Similar results were found in $g a d d 4 5 a ^ { - / - }$ MEF cells (Fig. S4).Additionally, the level of LC3-II expression increased after exposure to Baf in cells transfected with control vector, but the decreased tendency of LC3-II expression caused by GADD45A was not changed in Baf-treated 293T,HeLa and EC9706cellstransfectedwithMYC-GADD45A vector (Fig. 3C,3D).These results indicate that GADD45A affects autophagosome formation.

To further corroborate the above findings,tandem mRFPGFP-LC3 reporter (tfLC3 plasmid)was transfected into tumor cell lines，in which autophagosomes trigger both RFP and GFP signals, whereasthe autolysosomesemit only RFPsignal because of quenching of the GFP in the acidic lysosomal environment. GADD45A overexpression compromised green (vesicles that appear yellow in the merged images） and red autophagosomes inHeLa cells.Similarly，after exposure to Baf,the number of both green and red autophagosomes stilldecreased in GADD45A-overexpressingcells compared with cells transfected with thecontrol vectors (Figs.3E, S5A). In contrast, the number of green and red vesicles dramatically increased in GADD45Aknockdowncells without or with Baf treatment (Figs.3F，S5B)．These results suggestthatGADD45Ais involved in the inhibitionof autophagosome formation at an early stage.

Next, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of GADD45A on autophagy flux in the same cell lines. The expression of LC3-I and the number of both green and red dots decreased in GADD45A-overexpressing KYSE30 cells without or with Baf treatment (Fig. S6A, S6C).Conversely， knockdown of GADD45A also led to enhance ment of autophagic activities and the increased tendency was not changed after Baf treatment in GADD45A knockdown HeLa cells either through western blot or fluorescence analysis (Fig. S6B,S6D). These data further prove that the expression levels of GADD45A in cells are important for regulating autophagic flux.

GADD45A impairs the formation of the autophagy initiation complex

The MTOR pathway and the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex pathway are the most important negative and positive regulators for autophagy in mammalian cels， respectively.38,39 To explore the possible alterations in those pathways,we measured the expression levels of MTOR and p-MTOR in gadd45a knockout MEFs and knockdown tumor cells using western blots. The

results showed little effect of GADD45A on MTOR and pMTOR expression (Fig. S7). We then tested the expression of BECN1, which appears to act as a nexus point between autophagy and cell death pathways. The result showed that neither GADD45A overexpression nor deficiency changed the expression of BECN1. BECN1 is a part of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex andis required for the initiation of the autophagosome formation in autophagy. Human PIK3C3/VPS34 is the catalytic subunit of PtdIns3K.To test whether GADD45A is associated with the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, 2 plasmids (pcDNA3.1-FLAG and pCS2- MT, pcDNA3.1-FLAGPIK3C3 and pCS2-MTGADD45A, pcDNA3.1- FLAG-PIK3C3andpCS2- MT）were cotransfected into HeLa cells. Cells were lysed for immunoprecipitation (IP) with FLAG or BECN1 antibodies, andthe immunocomplexes were subjected to western blot assays.As reported previously, BECN1 could interact with PIK3C3.Interestingly, we found that anti-FLAG antibody precipitated less BECN1 protein in GADD45A-overexpressing HeLa cells,compared with cells transfected with the control vectors (Fig. 4A,4B). There was also less coprecipitation of FLAG-PIK3C3 with BECN1 in the immunocomplexesprecipitated byantiBECN1antibody(Fig. 4C, 4D)． Incontrast， in GADD45A knockdown cells, there were more amount of copurifying BECN1protein precipitated by FLAG magnetic beeds and BECN1 also precipitatedmoreFLAG-PIK3C3 protein compared with the negative control cells (Fig. 4E, 4F,

4G，4H)．Collectively，these data imply that GADD45A is able to disrupt the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex that is essential for autophagy initiation.

To analyze the influence of GADD45A on the endogenous BECN1 and PIK3C3 interaction， coimmunoprecipitation was used to test the interaction in GADD45A overexpression or deficiency cells. Clearly,antiPIK3C3 antibody precipitated lessendogenous BECN1in GADD45A-overexpressing cells but it did more in GADD45A knockdown cells compared with the control cells (Fig.5A,5B, 5E,5F).Likewise,the levels of endogenousPIK3C3precipitated by BECN1 wereaffected byexpression of GADD45A (Fig.5C,5D,5G,5H).These data confirm the function of GADD45A in the process of autophagy,which was shown in the above transfection experiments.

Two distinct PtdIns3-kinase complexes are well known: The ATG14complex(PIK3C3, PIK3R4/VPS15, BECN1, ATG14 andNRBF2) is requiredforautophagosome formation,40 and the UVRAG complex(PIK3C3，PIK3R4, BECN1 and UVRAG) has a unique activity in the endocytic pathway.41 y.41,42 ATG14 can interact with BECN1 and PIK3C3. Thus,we checked the influence of GADD45A on the interactionbetween ATG14and BECN1.But as shown in the Figure S8, there was no signifcant effect of GADD45A on the interaction between BECN1 and ATG14.

# GADD45A interacts withBECN1

Toinvestigatethe underlyingmechanism bywhich GADD45A interferes with the interaction between BECN1 and PIK3C3， we examined thephysicalassociationsamong GADD45A,BECN1 and PIK3C3.Cellular lysates from HeLa cells cotransfected with MYC-GADD45Aand FLAG-BECN1 or FLAG control vectors were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads.After immunoblotting analysis with MYC antibodies,MYC-GADD45A was detected in the HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-BECN1 but not in cells transfected with

Figure 4. GADD45A impaired the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex. (A, B, C, D) HeLa cels were harvested after cotransfection with pCS2-MT and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-PIK3C3or pCS2-MT-GADD45A and pcDNA3.1- FLAG-PIK3C3 or pCS2-MT and pcDNA3.1-FLAG.(A) Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads and the precipitated complexes were analyzed by immunoblots with anti-BECN1 antibody.

(B,D,F,H)Thedensitiesof signals were determined bydensitometryandare shown relative to the control group or the H1 group.Graphical data denote mean $\pm { \sf S D }$ $\ast \ast \ast , P < 0 . 0 0 1$ .

FLAG control vectors (Fig. 6A). Cells were also lysed for IP with GADD45Aantibodies，and BECN1 was detected in the immunocomplexesby western blotassays(Fig.6B). Similar results were also found in HeLa cells cotransfected with MYCGADD45A and FLAG-PIK3C3 or FLAG control vectors (Fig. 6A, 6B). These data indicate that GADD45A interacts with the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex. Moreover, we performed a glutathione S-transferase (GST) affinity isolation experiment to determine which components of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex were associated with GADD45A. To do this，GST-GADD45A fusionprotein wasincubated with cellular lysates isolated from HeLa cells,followed by western blots.Clearly，GST-GADD45A was able to pull down BECN1 comparedwith GSTalone (Fig. 6C)，but PIK3C3 did not interact with GST-GADD45A (results not shown). To further confirm the interaction between GADD45A and BECN1，we examined their subcellular localizations in HeLa cells by staining with MYC and BECN1 antibodies,respectively. Confocal microscopy assays exhibited a significant colocalization between BECN1 (brightgreenparticles) and GADD45A (bright red) (Fig. 6D)，but the colocalization between GADD45A and PIK3C3 was not clearly seen (Fig. S9). Furthermore, the endogenous BECN1 and GADD45A interaction was verified in HeLa cells by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 6E). Taken together, these results indicate a physical association between GADD45A and BECN1.

Next,we sought to identify the regions of GADD45A that are requiredforinteractionwith BECN1 using a series of MYCtagged GADD45A deletion protein expression vectors. Cell lysates from HeLa cells transfected with

MYC-tagged GADD45A deletion vectors were immunoprecipitated with antibody to BECN1 and blotted with anti-MYC antibody. As shown in Figure 6F,MYCGADD45A deletion was found in transfected HeLa cells.After incubation with BECN1 antibody, full-length MYC-GADD45A protein was apparently detected in immunocomplexes,while deletion ofthecarboxylterminusof GADD45A in (1-96) GADD45A and deletion of the N-terminus of GADD45A in (71-165) GADD45A still retained their binding activity for the interaction of GADD45A with BECN1. However，(1-71）GADD45A, (81-165) GADD45A and (111- 165）GADD45A were deficient forBECN1bindingactivity. These observations suggest that thecentralregionofthe GADD45A protein (amino acids between 71 and 81) is essential for itsinteraction with BECN1. Along with these observations, interaction between BECN1 and PIK3C3 was declined in immunocomplexes containing GADD45A (1-96,71-165)，but GADD45A (1-71,81-165 and 111-165) did not interfere the interaction. Collectively，these data demonstrate that GADD45A central region (aa 71 to 81） is necessary and suffcient for the interaction between GADD45A and BECN1.

In order to further demonstratewhethertheinteraction between GADD45A and BECN1 mediates the role of GADD45A in autophagy，we knocked down BECN1 in GADD45A knockdown cells (KYSE30）and overexpressing cells (HeLa)．As shown in Figure 7A and 7B, the overexpression of GADD45A in HeLa cellssubstantially suppressed autophagy，while knockdown of BECN1 resulted in negligible decrease of LC3-II, indicating that BECN1 mediates GADD45A-induced autophagy inhibition. The similar result was detected in GADD45A knockdown KYSE30 cells.Taken together,the interaction between GADD45A and BECN1 is required, to a great extent,for the role of GADD45A in the regulation of autophagy.

# Discussion

The GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible) proteins have been implicated in regulation of many cellular functions including DNA repair,cell cycle control, senescence and genotoxic stress. The GADD45 gene family encodes 3 related GADD45protein including GADD45A，GADD45B and

TP53 and BRCA1,44 can regulate arange of cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, proliferation，cell cycle checkpoint，apoptosisandtumor angiogenesis. Autophagyisan important lysosomal degradation pathway in tumorigenesisand development. Many molecular components of autophagy have beenidentified,but littleis knownabouttheregulatory mechanismsunderlyingtheir effector functions. Recent research demonstrated that GADD45B inhibited autophagy through regulating phosphorylation of MAPK14, but GADD45A could not induce MAPK14phosphorylation.45.46 Hence,these findings prompted us to study whether GADD45A can induce an autophagy response and what is the underlying mechanism．In this study，through western blot and immunofluorescence assays for specific markers of the autophagic system， we found that the number of autophagosomes inGADD45A knockout mice and MEF cells significantly increased as a result of GADD45A deletion.Further, GADD45A overexpression resulted in a significant reduction of LC3-II expression and autophagosomes amount in multiple tumor celllines.Thus, GADD45A, an important tumor suppressorgene, may regulate cancer malignant development through autophagy.

Autophagy is a highly dynamic andmulti-stepprocess. The steady state levels of LC3-II are affected by both synthesis and degradation. One approach to assess the effects on autophagy by clamping LC3-II and autophagosome degradation is to use Baf,a smallmoleculeinhibitorof autophagy.37 In our study， we

GADD45G. Functions of GADD45 family proteins are similar, but not identical,and their induction differs under diverse physiological conditions or in different cell types.43 GADD45A,one of the most critical downstream targets of tumor suppressor found that the expression of LC3-II increased in GADD45A knockdown cels and decreased in GADD45A overexpressing cells compared with the control after cells treated with Baf. The tendency is in agreement with the observations in cells without

Baf treatment. In addition,we also obtained similar results in examining RFP-GFP-LC3 protein that is used to detect autolysosomes. Therefore, these findings demonstrate that GADD45A may impair autoph agy at early stage of autophagosome formation.

With regard to the mechanism by which GADD45A regulates autophagy, we found that the regulatory effect of GADD45A on autophagyiscloselyrelated to the formationoftheBECN1- PIK3C3autophagyinitiation complex.GADD45A is able to physicallyassociate with BECN1, but not PIK3C3.The interaction between GADD45A and BECN1 dissociates the BECN1 and PIK3C3 complex. Further evidence in the study shows that the central region of GADD45A (aa 71 to 81) is critical for GADD45Ainteractionwith BECN1．Thus，it can be concluded that GADD45A directly interacts with BECN1 to destabilize the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex,and in turn abrogates the autophagy process (Fig. 8A).But we found that there was no significant effect of GADD45A on the interaction between BECN1 and

ATG14. BECN1 forms multiple complexes with PIK3C3: ATG14-BECN1-PIK3C3-PIK3R4，UVRAG-BECN1-PIK3C3- PIK3R4，BECN1-PIK3C3.BECN1 and PIK3C3 are the core components of these complexes.Thus GADD45A disruption of the interaction between BECN1 and PIK3C3 can also affect the whole complex integrity, that could be the ATG14 complex or it could be the UVRAG complex.

Apoptosis and autophagy are both tightly regulated biological processes that play a central role in tissue homeostasis,development and disease.Apoptosis occurs spontaneously in malignant tumors,often markedly retarding their growth,and it is increased in tumors responding to irradiation，cytotoxic chemotherapy, heatingand hormoneablation.4748 Autophagy isadouble-dged sword which can either kill cancer cells or protect them from unfavorable conditions.At the early stage of tumorigenesis, autophagy functions as a tumor suppressor,but at advanced stages of tumor development, autophagy promotes tumor progresion.4Multiplestudiessuggestthatautophagyisaprotective response through which cancer cells acquire resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.Cancer stem cells are highly resistant to ionizing radiation and other anticancer treatments with increased autophagy.49 Meanwhile， GADD45A is induced by varieties of genotoxic stress agents including ionizing radiation and alkylating agents. In our previous report, we demonstrated that GADD45A can induce apoptosis,which is coupled with BCL2L11 release from the microtubule associated dynein motor complex and translocation to the mitochondria.30 In this study, we show that GADD45A inhibits autophagy through the interaction with BECN1. Thus, as a tumor suppressor, GADD45A may induce cancer cell death through 2 different pathways during the process of tumorigenesis and development. We hypothesize the possible role of GADD45A in cancer treatment that the increased expression of GADD45A after radiotherapy and chemotherapy in cancer cells induces apoptosis and inhibits autophagy to reduce tumor recurrence. Thus,GADD45A may be an important target in anticancer therapy (Fig. 8B).

In summary, our study demonstrated that GADD45A may function as a negative regulator in autophagy via affecting the interaction between BECN1 and PIK3C3.These findings explore a new function of GADD45A and unveil the mechanisms of GADD45A in regulating autophagy. Therefore, GADD45A is able to induce cancer cells death through 2 accordance with the Chinese Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals.

(B) GADD45A can be induced by varieties of genotoxic stress agents,such as UVR,IR,alkylating agents and hydroxyurea. After radiotherapy and chemotherapy， GADD45A induced by stresses in cancer cells may dramatically inhibit autophagy to reduce tumor recurrence.
