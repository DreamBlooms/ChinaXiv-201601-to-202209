To investigate theasymmetric effect of the naphthalimide moietyon the thermal,mechanical,optical propertiesand water uptake of polyimides (Pls),two novel asymmetric diamines,4-(4-aminophenoxy)- $N$ -amino-1,8-naphthalimide 3and 4-(4-aminophenoxy)-N-(4-aminophenyl)-1,8-naphthalimide 4 were synthesized. Two series of $\mathsf { P l s ~ 5 b { \mathrm { - } } e }$ and 6a-e were prepared from diamines 3 and 4 by solution polymerization method,respectively.The resulting polyimides demonstrated good solubility， high glass transition temperature $( { T } _ { \mathfrak { g } } )$ of $3 1 1 - 4 2 1 ^ { \circ } C$ and good thermal stability based on the $5 \%$ weight loss temperature $( T _ { 5 \% } )$ of $4 3 5 - 5 6 3 ^ { \circ } C$ in nitrogen.These Pls also exhibited good mechanical properties with tensile strengths of $1 0 7 . 3 \substack { - 1 7 2 . 2 } \mathsf { M P a } .$ tensile moduli of 2.8-4.9 GPa，and elongations at break of $2 . 9 \mathrm { - } 9 . 1 \%$ .The water uptake of Pls was in the range of $0 . 3 3 \substack { - 1 . 9 6 \% }$ .The polyimides displayed UV-vis absorption maxima and an intense fluorescent intensity in the range of 361-371 and $4 8 0 { - } 7 0 0 \ \mathsf { n m } .$ respectively.

# 1.Introduction

Polyimides (PIs),an important type of high temperature polymer,have found applications inadhesives,composite matrices, optoelectronics and aerospace due to their excellent thermal, mechanical and electrical properties as well as outstanding chemical resistance.1-3 However, the wide applications for PIs are often limited due to their poor organosolubility as well as high melt viscosity，derived from the rigid backbones and strong inter-chain interactions.Some structural modifications, such as the incorporation of flexible ether linkages4-11 and use of geometrically or molecularly asymmetric diamine monomers,12-18 resulted into better solubility and processability of polyimides.Generally,it has been noticed that ether linkages lead to low glass transition temperature $\left( T _ { \mathrm { g } } \right)$ of PIs due to reduced chain stiffness.On the other hand, the combination of arigidandbulkynaphthalimidering with etherlinkageinto the polymer chains can increase $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ and thermal stability of PIs by decreasing segmental mobility of polymer chain without deteriorating their solubility.19,20

In the past few decades,several research groups reported poly(ether imide)s having a N-N linkage (I) between naphthalimide and phthalimide groups in the polymer backbone (Fig.1). These PIs exhibited good solubility，very high $T _ { \mathrm { g } } ,$ excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties.21-24 These PIs with $\mathbf { N } { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { N }$ linkage were mainly prepared from symmetric bis(N-amino naphthalimide)s (II) which acted as diamines when reacted with aromatic dianhydrides. However， poor reactivity and solubility of these symmetric diamines in common organic solvents,confined the synthesis of corresponding bisimide (I) based PIs to one-step polymerization method.22,23

Fig.1 Different structures of naphthalimide based diamines and bisimide units in polyimide.

The introduction of a benzene ring into the $N \cdot$ amino naph thalimide moiety may overcome the problem of poor reactivity of diamine and offers bisimide (III) based PIs by conventional two-step polymerization (Fig.1).In addition, structurally more rigidbisimide (III) basedPIs are also expected to showhigher thermal stability and mechanical properties than PIs contain ing bisimide (1).

Asfar we know,there are limited reports about the asymmetric diamines containing naphthalimide group.Fora better comparison to investigate the effect of bisimides (I) and (IIl) on polyimides properties，we designed two novel asymmetric diamines 3and 4,and synthesized their corresponding PIs 5b-e and 6a-e,respectively.The properties of both series of PIs,such as solubility,thermal,mechanical and optical properties as well as water uptake are studied.

4-Bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride was purchased fromAladdin Chemical Co.and used as received.4-Amino-benzenephenol was purified by two times recrystallization from hot water. Pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and $p$ -phenylenediamine 一 $\dot { p }$ -PDA) were sublimed before use. $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -Oxydiphthalicanhydride (ODPA), $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -biphthalicdianhydride (BPDA), $^ { 3 , 3 ^ { \prime } , 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), $^ { 4 , 4 ^ { \prime } }$ -bisphenol A dianhydride (BPADA) and other reagents used in this study were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Plant and used without further purification.

# 2.2. Instrumentation

The $^ 1 \mathrm { H }$ NMR spectra were measured at $4 0 0 \ : \mathrm { M H z }$ on a Bruker 400 AVANCE III spectrometer,using dimethyl sulfoxide $d _ { 6 } \left( \mathrm { D M S O \ – } d _ { 6 } \right)$ （20 as solvent. Melting points were determined on an XT4-100B melting point apparatus (Beijing Keyi Elec-opti instrument) and were uncorrected.The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were obtained with a Thermo Nicolet 67oo FT-IR spectrometer, where the sample was prepared with KBr pellets. The UV-vis spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 95O spectrophotometer at room temperature in the absorption mode.The fluorescence spectra were obtained from a Horiba Fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer.The inherent viscosities were measured with an Ubbelodhe viscometer at $3 0 \pm 0 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in $m$ cresol or $N \mathrm { \Omega }$ -methyl2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at a concentration of $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { g } \ \mathrm { d L } ^ { - 1 }$ . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Diamond TG/DTA instrument at a heating rate of $1 0 \ ^ { \circ } { \bf C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ in the temperature range of 50 to $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate of $5 0 \mathrm { \ m L \ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ ).Differential scanning calorimetry (DsC) was carried out using Mettler Toledo DSC at a heating rate of $2 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ in the temperature range of 50 to $4 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under nitrogen atmosphere with $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ gas flow, and $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ was reported as temperature at the middle of the thermal transition in the second heating scan after deleting thermal history.The tensile strength measurements were taken using five PI film samples by an Instron model 5567 at a crosshead speed of $5 \mathrm { { m m } \mathrm { { m i n } ^ { - 1 } } }$ at room temperature,and the results were averaged. The specimen gauge lengths were $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ and the specimen widths were $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ . To achieve ground state geometry, energy minimized structures were drawn by Gaussian software using quantum chemistry method. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurement of the polyimide films was undertaken on a Bruker D8 Advance with $\mathrm { C u } \mathrm { K } \mathfrak { a }$ radiation $( 4 0 \mathrm { k V } , 4 0 \mathrm { m A } )$ from5 to $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ . Water uptake was measured according to Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) K 6911:a specimen was dried in an oven at $5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ and was cooled to room temperature in a desiccator over silica gel.After the dry specimen was weighted byusinga Mettler Toledo Analytical Balance AL2o4,itwas soaked in deionized water at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ .After the specimen was taken out from the water,the external water was removed,and the specimen was weighted in1 min.Three specimens were used for each polymer,and the water uptake was reported as the average. The water uptake (WU) was determined by the weighing of the changes in vacuum-dried flm specimens before and after immersion in deionized water at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ using the following eqn (1):

$$
\mathrm { W U \ ( ^ { \circ } / } \mathrm { { o } } ) = \frac { W _ { \mathrm { w e t } } - W _ { \mathrm { d r y } } } { W _ { \mathrm { d r y } } } \times 1 0 0 \
$$

where $W _ { \mathrm { d r y } }$ is the initial weight of the film samples and $W _ { \mathrm { w e t } }$ is the weight of the film samples after immersion in deionized water. The water uptake of the polyimides is the mean data of three parallel samples.The qualitative solubility of polymers was tested with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of a sample in $2 { \mathrm { ~ m L ~ } }$ of the solvent. Limited oxygen index (LOI) of the polymers can be calculated by using Van Krevelen and Hoftyzer eqn (2),which have char yield as decisive factor.

Polyimides 5b-e were synthesized from reaction of monomer 3 with various aromatic dianhydrides by one-step polymerization in $m$ cresol in the presence of a catalytic amount of benzoic acid at $1 9 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ (Scheme 2). The synthetic procedure for polyimides 5e is employed as an example to illustrate the general synthetic route.Diamine 3 $( 1 . 2 7 7 1 \mathrm { g } , 4 . 0 \mathrm { m m o l } )$ was dissolved in $m$ cresol $( 1 3 \ \mathrm { m L } )$ ina two-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet and a distillation head.

# 3.1.Synthesis of monomers

4-Bromo $. N \cdot$ amino-1,8-naphthalimide 1 and 4-bromo $N \cdot$ (4 aminophenyl)-1,8-naphthalimidewith 2 were prepared from 4- bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride in ethanol with high yield $( 9 5 \% )$ in the first step as shown in Scheme 1.Then the nucleophilic displacement of 1and 2 with 4-aminophenol proceeded very smoothly in the presence of potassium carbonate as base to synthesize asymmetric diamines 3 and 4.Chemical structures of the targeted monomers were characterized with ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR, FTIR and $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ NMR spectroscopy.

The ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR spectra of diamines 3 and 4 are shown in Fig. 2. In diamine 3, the amino group of attached to the naphthalimide moiety exhibited chemical shift at $5 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { \ p p m }$ while amino attached to benzene ring on the other end of diamine monomer showed at 5.21 ppm (Fig.2). In $\mathrm { ^ 1 H }$ NMR spectrum of 4,both amino groups showed chemical shift at 5.23 ppm owing to comparatively similar proton environment (Fig. 2). $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ NMR spectroscopy also supported with the structures of diamines 2 and 4 (Fig.S1t).The FT-IR spectrum of the diamines 3 and 4 showed characteristic $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ absorptions of naphthalimide ring at $1 6 4 5 { - } 1 7 2 0 \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and $3 3 1 6 { - } 3 4 5 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ of the amino (N-H)

# 3.2.Synthesis of polyimides

Hayand co-workersreported that， $\boldsymbol { N } , \boldsymbol { N } ^ { \prime }$ -diamino-1,4,5,8- naphthalenetetracarboxylicbisimidewhichacted as symmetric diamine,was failed to synthesize polyimides by one and two-step polymerization methods,due to the insolubility of symmetric diamine in NMP at ambient temperature,and insolubility of oligomers which formed in the early stages of the polymerization reaction.²’ However,diamines 3 and 4 have good solubility in NMP owing to their asymmetric structure. Polymerization of diamine 3 was performed with several aromatic dianhydrides by one-step polymerization method using $m$ -cresol to achieve high molecularweight polyimides 5b-e,while two-step polymerization method failed due to poor reactivity of the amino group attached to the imide group in diamine 3.When PMDA was used, precipitation occurred due to poor solubility of polymer 5a.In comparison, the reactivity of the diamine 4 was sufficiently high enough to give high molecular weight polyimides 6a-e by conventional two-step polymerization.However,for diamine 4,one-steppolymeriza tion was failed due to the poor solubility of polyimides in $m$ -cresol (solid weight content ${ \sim } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ！

Hence,two different polymerizationmethodswere employed on the basis of the difference in reactivity of diamines,and solubility of their corresponding polyimides.The inherent viscosities of polyimides 5b-e and polyamic acids of PIs 6a-e, were found in the range of $0 . 5 7 \mathrm { - } 0 . 9 5$ and $0 . 6 1 \substack { - 0 . 9 7 }$ dL $\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at $3 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ,respectively.All the polyimides could be cast into flexible and tough films.

The polyimides were characterized with ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR,FT-IRand $^ { 1 3 } \mathrm { C }$ NMR spectroscopy. In the ${ } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }$ NMR spectrum of polyimide 5e, $\Nu \mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ signal of diamine and amide proton were absent which showed successful imidization of polyimide (Fig.3).In the FT-IR spectra ofPI 5eand6e,characteristic peaks ofasymmetric $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ stretching of phthalimide and naphthalimide were observed at1788,1774and $1 7 7 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (Fig.4).In the spectrum of PI 5e,peaks at1733,1720 and $1 6 9 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ were attributed to symmetric $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ stretching of the two phthalimides (hydrazinebased imide group and conventional imide group) and naphthalimide group，respectively.However，PI 6e derived from diamine 4,have similar environment around two phthalimide rings,and showed symmetric $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ stretching of phthalimides and naphthalimide at 1712 and $1 6 6 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively. Imide group of polyimides also indicated peaks 1342 and $1 3 5 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (C-N stretching) and $7 2 7 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ 0 $\scriptstyle \mathrm { C = O }$ bending).2225 In addition, in the spectrum of 5e,the peak at $1 1 8 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was assigned to the N-N stretching.

# 3.3.Solubility

The solubility behaviour of the polyimide is summarized in Table 1.The polyimides 5b-e based on diamine 3 showed improved solubility in $m$ cresol,N, $^ { N , N }$ -dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMsO) as compared to 6a-e based on diamine 4.Polyimides based on rigid dianhydrides (PMDA,BPDA,BTDA) were relatively poor soluble in tested organic solvents.PI 5e based on BPADA with two flexible ether linkages and diamine 3,showed excellent solubility among all polyimides.In comparison，polyimide 6e was relatively less soluble.The better solubility of polyimides 5b-e was attributed to non-coplanar conformation of naphthalimide and phthalimide rings of bisimide unit (I),which were greatly twisted due ä The inherent viscosities of PIs (5b-e in $m$ cresol) and PAAs (6a-e in NMP) were measured at a concentration of $0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ g ~ d L } ^ { - 1 }$ at $3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ： $^ b + +$ soluble at room temperature; $^ +$ soluble on heating; $\pm$ partially soluble on heating;-insoluble on heating.THF: tetrahydrofuran.

to steric repulsion of the $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C } = \mathbf { O }$ groups (Fig. 5), broke up the conjunction along the backbone,and hindered the formation of intermolecular change-transfer complexes.²²In polyimides 6a-e,benzene ring between two imides rings of bisimide (III) polymer main chain not only maintained the steric repulsion of the carbonyl groups but also increased rigidity in polyimides. Such increased rigidity of polymer chain may be caused the comparative decrease in the solubility ofPIs 6a-e.Moreover, the strong intermolecular $\pi { - } \pi$ stacking interactionsamong naphthalimide moiety and aromatic rings may be also increased the chain packing.26 All of these polyimides derived from asymmetric diamines 3and 4,exhibited better solubility than reported symmetric bis(N-amino naphthalimide).2² Asymmetric structure of diamine in polyimide main unit disturbed chain packing and intermolecular interactions of the polymer and increased the solubility.

# 3.4. Thermal and mechanical properties

Differential scanning calorimetry (DsC) and thermal gravi metric analysis (TGA) were performed to investigate the thermal properties of the polyimide.The $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ of the PIs,which is one of the key parameters of polymers when considering the hightemperature devices fabrication and optical applications,was determined by the DsC analysis.All studied PIs based on asymmetric diamine 3 exhibited high $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ $\left( > 3 1 1 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \right)$ with no melting endotherms.

In comparison,PIs 6a-e based on diamine 4 showed higher $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ （20 $\left( > 3 3 8 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \right)$ and better thermal stability.PI 6b comprised of BPDA presented $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ at of $4 2 1 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ while in case of 6a, there was no $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ observed until $4 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，Evidently,the increase in $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ of 6a-e was attributed to the more rigid and highly packed structure due to three aromatic rings (naphthalimide-benzene-phthalimide） unit in the polymer along with the non-coplanarity (Fig.5).Moreover，the strong intermolecular $\pi { - } \pi$ stacking interactions driven by naphthalimide moiety with aromatic rings may also cause the increase of $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ in the polyimides.2 DSC curves of PIs (5b,5e,6b,6e) are represented in Fig.6.In comparison,polyimides derived from symmetric bis(N-amino naphthalimide)s showed higher $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ (up to $4 3 8 \ { } ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } _ { \mathcal { I } }$ and compa rable thermal stabilityto polyimides fromasymmetric diamines (3 and 4).22-24 The $5 \%$ weight-loss temperature $T _ { 5 \% }$ values of PIs 5b-e were observed at $4 3 5 { \mathrm { - } } 4 8 1 { \mathrm { ~ \textdegree C } }$ in nitrogen atmosphere which were inferior to the thermal stability of PIs 6a-e derived from diamine 4 (Fig. 6) and may be attributed to the low bond energy of the N-N bond (the bond energy of the $\mathbf { N } { \cdot } \mathbf { N }$ bond is 159 $\mathrm { k J \ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ ,whereas that of the $\scriptstyle \mathbf { C - C }$ bond is $3 3 2 \mathrm { \ k J \ m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ .27

The limited oxygen index (LOI) is the minimum concentration of oxygen expressed as a percentage that will support combustion of a polymer- the higher the LOI,the lower the flammability.The LOI value can be used to evaluate the flame retardancy of polymeric materials.Since air comprises about $2 1 \%$ oxygen by volume,any material with a limiting oxygen index less than this will burn easily in air,while those with a higherLOI will not tend to burn.

LOI values of PIs 5b-e and 6a-e calculated from their char yield were found higher than 31.7 and 37.7，respectively (Table 2).On the basis of LOl values， these phthalnaphthalimide based polyimides can be classified as selfextinguishing polymers.

The mechanical properties of the polyimides are tabulated in Table 3.All of the polyimides were able to cast as transparent, flexible,and tough film with good mechanical strength.PIs 6a-e demonstrated high tensile moduli of 2.8-4.9 GPa and tensile strengths of $1 0 7 . 3 \substack { - 1 7 2 . 2 \mathrm { \ M P a } }$ and elongations at break of $2 . 9 \mathrm { - }$ $9 . 1 \%$ .In comparison,PIs 5b-e showed lower tensile moduli of

It was also noted that for the polyimides containing same diamine 4,the tensile strengths and tensile moduli decreased with increasing the flexibility of the dianhydride unit.

ä Water uptake of polyimide films were measured immersing films of these polyimides in deionized water at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ：

# 3.5.Wide-angle X-ray diffraction

The crystallinity and chain packing of the polyimide films were analyzedbywide-angle X-raydiffraction (WAXD).Regardless of the dianhydrides and diamines employed,the WAXD patterns of all the PI films were broad without obvious peak features, indicating the amorphous nature of PIs (Fig.7).The amorphous nature of the polyimides could be attributed to the introduction of asymmetric diamine and bulky naphthalimide group in the polymer chain backbone,which resulted the poor intermolecular packing.The mean intermolecular distances ( $d$ spacing) of these PIs could be calculated from the maxima of the broad diffraction peaks by Bragg's equation.PIs 5b-e exhibited the diffraction peak at $2 \theta = 1 7 . 2 – 1 9 . 9 ^ { \circ }$ with $d$ -spacing of $4 . 8 \substack { - 5 . 2 \mathring { \mathbf { A } } }$ whereas PIs 6a-e demonstrated diffraction peak at $2 \theta = 1 7 . 3 \AA$ $2 4 . 2 ^ { \circ }$ with $d _ { \ l }$ -spacing of $3 . 7 { - } 5 . 1 \mathring { \mathbf { A } } .$

On comparing the pattern for dianhydrides,it could be observed that the $d$ -spacing are greater for lessrigid dianhydrides such as BPADA,which offered loose chain packing and aggregation.Moreover,X-ray data indicated that polyimides 6ae based on diamine 4 have relatively denser polymer chain packing than PIs 5b-e.WXRD result is consistent with other findings from $T _ { \mathrm { g } } ,$ solubility and mechanical properties.

# 3.6. Wateruptake

The water uptake of polyimides might be related to several factors including the chemical structures,the introduction of functional groups,the geometrical packing of the polymer chains as well as film-processing parameters,and so forth in which the chemical structure and the presence of functional groups in polymer might be major concern factors.28 The bulky group could loosen the packing of the polyimide backbone chains,resulting in the increase of free volume in the polymers that should ensure the polymer to entrap some of the water molecules.2 The water uptake (WU) of PIs was determined in deionizedwaterat $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ (Table3).Polyimides5b-ewith loosen chain packing showed water uptake in the range of $\phantom { - } 1 . 0 4 -$ $1 . 9 6 \%$ while PIs 6a-e with tight chain packing showed in the range of $0 . 3 3 \substack { - 1 . 1 3 \% }$ .PI 5e and 6e based on BPADA with two ether kinks showed relatively high water uptake due to the increase of free volume of polymer and interaction of ether linkage with water molecules.

# 3.7.Optical properties

3.7.1 Uv-vis absorption. The optical properties of the studied polyimides in solution state were analysed by UV-vis spectroscopy.The UV-visible spectra of diamines 3 and 4 were taken by dissolving in NMP $\left( 1 \ \times \ 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \ \mathrm { m o l \ L ^ { - 1 } } \right)$ . Diamine 3 exhibited absorption with the lowest energy absorption maximum at ca. $3 7 4 \mathrm { n m }$ ,while diamine 4 at $3 6 8 \mathrm { n m }$ (Fig. $\mathbf { S } 3 \dagger .$ .It is apparent that the wavelength of maximum absorption is related to the $\pi  \pi ^ { * }$ transition resulting from the conjugation between the aromatic ring of donor group 4-aminophenylether to the bay position of naphthalene imide core.All polyimides 5b-e showed typical naphthalimide absorption peak at $3 7 1 \mathrm { n m }$ in the UV-vis absorption spectra using NMP at dilute concentration $\left( 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ L ^ { - 1 } } \right)$ as shown in Fig.8.In comparison, polyimide 6a-e showed shift of offset broad absorption bands to shorter wavelength $( \sim 3 6 1 \ \mathrm { n m } )$ ，which may be attributed to better chain packing as compared to 5b-e (Fig. 8).

3.7.2Photoluminescence (PL) study.Itis believed that the development of emission color in 1,8-naphthalimidesis dependent on the presence of a strong electron-donating substitute on the 4-position of the naphthalimide ring.26,29 When hydrogen is replaced by an electron-donating group,the fluorescent quantum yield is gradually increased and the emission wavelength is red-shifted from blue to green region.29 Polyimides films 6a-e showed broader emission spectra in the range of $4 8 0 { - } 6 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ with intense fluorescence at ${ \sim } 5 7 6 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .In contrast,polyimides 5b-e showed a broader emission range of $4 8 5 \mathrm { - } 7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ with intense fluorescent at ${ \sim } 5 4 1 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ (Fig. 9). The nucleophilicity of the 4-aminophenylether moiety decreases fromBPADA based PI to PMDA based PI and intensity of fluorescence increases in same pattern.The strong electron defciency of the corresponding dianhydride moiety may be curtailed the electrophilicity of 4-amino moietyin the diamine. This change in fluorescence intensity among the PIs can also be attributed to the charge transfer (CT) interactions.29,30 CT may occur between the electron-donor (diamine) and electronacceptor (dianhydride) fragments of the PIs.Polyimide 5e and 6e comprised of BPADA, the lesser denser molecular aggregation，showed the strongest fluorescent intensity，while polyimide 6a from PMDA is the weakest. This suggests that the CT fluorescence in polyimides 5b-e is sensitive to the orientation of local polymer structures.30

# 4. Conclusion

Two novel asymmetric diamines 3 and 4 were synthesized and employedto react with several aromatic anhydrides to yield two series of new polyimides 5b-e and 6a-e through one and two steppolymerization method. Both series ofpolyimides showed good solubility in various polar and nonpolar solvents due to asymmetric and non-coplanar bisimides linkages (I and III) in polyimide main chain.PIs 6a-e exhibited excellent thermal stability,high $T _ { \mathrm { g } }$ values and good mechanical properties as compared to PIs 5b-e.Such improved properties were attributed to the more rigid and highly packed structure of bisimide moiety $\mathbf { \Pi } ( \mathbf { I I I } )$ in the polymer along with the noncoplanarity. The polymers also have strong fluorescence.
