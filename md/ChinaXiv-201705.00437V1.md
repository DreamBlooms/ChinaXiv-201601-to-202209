Quantitative investigation is conducted on the resistance sources of the components in the NiO-YSZ/ YSZ/GDC/LSCF-GDC solid oxide electrolysis cell(SOEC) stack at the $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } / \mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ ratios of 70/30,80/20 and $9 0 /$ 10at $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C .$ The results indicate that the cell resistance accounts for $7 6 . 3 \substack { - 6 6 . 7 \% }$ of that of the stack repeating unit (SRU),the contact resistance (CR) between the air electrode current-collecting layer (AECCL) and the interconnect accounts for $2 3 . 6 \mathrm { - } 2 7 . 0 \%$ ,the CR between the hydrogen electrode currentcollecting layer(HECCL）and the interconnect only accounts for $2 . 3 \mathrm { - } 3 . 2 \%$ ，and the resistance of the interconnect can be neglected.Duration test of the stack is conducted at $0 . 8 \mathrm { \ A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ for $3 8 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，the cell resistance increase is found to be the major contribution of the SRU degradation $( 8 2 . 2 \%$ of the SRU degradation)while the air electrode CR increase and the hydrogen electrode CR increase are other two important factors.

# 1.Introduction

In recent years,solid oxide cell (SOC) technology has attracted increasing attention for development of a highly-efficient energy conversion and storage system because it can perform the dual functions of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC)[1,2].Although the overall SOEC reaction for hydrogen production is simply the reverse of the SOFC reaction for power generation,there are fundamental differences in two operatingmodes,suchas the electric potential,heat flow,mass fluxand gas environments,which lead to different performances and system efficiencies in the two operatingmodes[3].Therefore,research on SOEC is rather independent from research on SOFC.

For commercial purposes to obtain applicable hydrogen/gas fuel,multiple unit cells with limited voltage need to be connected in series to forma SOEC stack.And from the view of commercialization,long-term stabilityof the SOEC stack isa premise besides the high hydrogen productivity.Alimited number of studies have been performed on the performance and durability issues of SOEC stacks.Significant performance degradation was observed in the large-scale production of hydrogen from nuclear energy using externally manifolded stacks with three modules basedon electrolyte-supported cells [4].A long-term performance degradation of $> 5 \% \mathrm { k h } ^ { - 1 }$ was also found during durability tests of short stacks based on standard Ni-YSZ supported cells at $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } C$ with a current density of $0 . 5 \mathrm { A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ for $2 7 0 0 { \mathrm { h } }$ in SOEC mode [5]. These reported degradation rates were much higher than the degradation rates for SOFC stacks.

In previous SOEC stack tests,Cr vapor poisoning,air electrode delamination,microstructure degradation,and seal leakage were found to significantly affect the durability of the stack [6-9]. However, the dominating mechanism for SOEC stack degradation isnot clear yet. Sincea SOEC undergoes essentially the reverse process of a SOFC,the SOEC technology can be built based on the extensively researched SOFC technology. In SOFC stacks,the key causes influencing the operating stability of the stacks include stack components and the interfacial contact between the components [1o,11]. In previous investigation，our group gave a quantitative description of the contributions of the resistance sources of components to SOFC stack performance [12]，and found the increase of the cell resistance is the main reason causing the stack degradation and the anodic contact is also an influencing factor that cannot be neglected during stable operation.

The effect of the interfacial contact to the SOEC stack performance has not been reported yet,especially the variation of the interfacial contact resistance (CR) during long-term operation of the SOEC stack.The present study was thus initiated to give a quantitative investigation on the resistance sources of the SOEC stackwitha focus on the contribution of interface contact between different stack components during long-term operation. The SOEC stacks based on hydrogen electrolyte supported NiO-YSZ/YSZ/ GDC/LSCF-GDC cells were assembled and the resistance of each stack component was carefully measured.A quantitative analysis was carried out based on the patterns by which the resistance of every component influences the SOEC stack performance.

# 2.Experimental

The unit cell (UC) used in the experiments was a hydrogen electrode-supported NiO-YSZ/YSZ/GDC/LSCF-GDC (GDC: $\mathbf { C e } _ { 0 . 9 } \mathbf { G } \mathbf { d } _ { 0 . 1 } \mathbf { O } _ { 1 . 9 5 }$ ：LSCF: $\mathrm { L a _ { 0 . 6 } S r _ { 0 . 4 } C o _ { 0 . 2 } F e _ { 0 . 8 } O _ { 3 - \delta } ) }$ SOEC cell. Details of the cell manufacturing process and the parameters were reported in our previous research [13].The cell size in the stack was $1 0 \ \mathrm { c m } \times 1 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ with an active area of about $6 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ .For the complete contact between the cell electrodes and the metal interconnects,a coating of NiO current-collecting layer with $8 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ thickness was screen printed on the cell hydrogen electrode and a coating of LSCF current-collecting layer of ${ 8 0 \mu \mathrm { m } }$ -thickwasscreen printed on the cell air electrode.

The cells and interconnect plates were then assembled into a 2- cell stack using $\mathsf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 } { - } \mathsf { S i O } _ { 2 }$ -CaO-based glass sealants.The SUS430 ferritic stainless steel was used to create metal interconnects, which were also adopted as co-flow gas channels.To protect from high-temperature oxidation and Cr vaporization,the air electrode side of the interconnect was densely coated with $\mathsf { N i mathrm { - } C r / L S M }$ composite coating by plasma spraying.The 2-cell stack thus included two pieces of stack repeating units (SRUs):each piece of SRU was consisted of a piece of UC and two pieces of neighboring interconnects as shown in Fig.1.The SRUs in the stack were numbered 1# and $^ { 2 \# }$ ,respectively.

Afterassembly, the stack was placed intoa furnace and heated to $8 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ a a rate of $1 \ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ .For stack sealing,an external pressure of ${ \sim } 1 0 \ \mathrm { N } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ was loaded on the stack at $8 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ After remained at $8 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 2 h }$ ，the stack was cooled to $7 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for testing.The hydrogen electrode of the stack was subjected to nitrogen purging for $5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ,and then hydrogenand air were fed into thehydrogenandair electrodes of the stack,respectively.After $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ for hydrogen electrode reduction, the mixture of $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } / \mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ was then fed to the hydrogen electrode side of the stack and the real-time variation of current and voltage were recorded.After finishing all the tests,the stack was cooled to room temperature at a rate of $1 \ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ with hydrogen to protect the hydrogen electrode from oxidization. Microstructures of the stack components were examined using a Hitachi S-48oo scanning electron microscope.

Voltage leads were led from the components of the stack as shown in Fig.1 to quantitatively measure the resistance of the components in the SRUs [12,14].The interconnect resistance was measured by leads 1-2；the contact resistance between the hydrogen electrode current-collecting layer（HECCL）and the interconnect (hydrogen electrode CR),was measured by leads 2-3; the internal resistance of the UC was measured by leads 3-4;the contact resistance between the air electrode current-collecting layer (AECCL）and the interconnect (air electrode CR)，was measured by leads $_ { 4 - 5 }$ ；and the resistance of the SUR was measured by leads 1-5 [12,15].

# 3.Results and discussion

# 3.1.Quantitative contribution of resistance sources to stack electrolysisperformance

Fig.2a and b shows the performance of the SRUs and UCs under different $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } / \mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ ratios,respectively. It indicated that under the same operating condition,the $_ { \mathrm { I - V } }$ curves of SRU1# and SRU $^ { 2 \# }$ ,UC 1# and UC $^ { 2 \# }$ were very close.The resistance of SRU1#,SRU2#,UC 1# and Uc $^ { 2 \# }$ under different $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } / \mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ ratioswasobtained by linear fitting of I-V curves ( $\mathrm { f r o m } 0 \mathsf { A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ to $0 . 3 0 \mathrm { A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ )and the results arelisted in Table1.Apparently,the SRU1# and SRU $^ { 2 \# }$ were almost consistent,with the increase of the $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } / \mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ ratio,the ASRof both the SRU and UC decreased significantly whereas the contribution of the UC to the SRU in ASR decreased.This is because the electrical splitting ofwater was stimulated bya high steam flow rate due to enhanced gas diffusion through the electrode [16] whereas the interface contact may deteriorate with the increasing steam content.

In the stack, the air electrode CR was measured by the voltage leads 4-5,the hydrogen electrode CR by leads 2-3,and the interconnect resistance byleads1-2.Because the ASRvalues of the airelectrode contact,hydrogen electrode contact and interconnect were small,the voltage between both ends of the air electrode contact was thus obtained by the difference between the voltage valuesof theleads3-4andleads3-5,and thevoltage between both ends of the hydrogen electrode contact was obtained by the difference between the voltage values of the leads 3-4 and leads 2-4.Therefore,theI-V curves for the air electrode contact and the hydrogen electrode contact could be obtained,as shown in Fig.2c and d.The ASRs for the air electrode and hydrogen electrode contact could be calculated by linear fitting and the results are listed in Table 1.The results indicated that the hydrogen electrode CRwasalmost ten times smallerthan thatofair electrode.Withthe increase of the $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } / \mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ ratio,the air electrode CR of the SRU increased,while the hydrogen electrode CR increased slightly. Closer examination of the results showed the air electrode CRs accounted for $2 3 . 6 \%$ ， $2 6 . 2 \%$ and $2 7 . 0 \%$ ，respectively，while the hydrogen electrode CRs accounted for only $2 . 3 \%$ ， $2 . 6 \%$ and $3 . 2 \%$ respectively.The total resistance of the UC,the air electrode contact and the hydrogen electrode contact was over or less than $100 \%$ of SRU due to the test errors of the apparatus.Generally, the UC in the SRU was the main factor determining the performance,accounting for $7 6 . 3 \mathrm { - } 6 6 . 7 \%$ .And the air electrode contact was the second factor, generally accounting for $2 3 . 6 \mathrm { - } 2 7 . 0 \%$ .The hydrogen electrode contact was the minimum factor,only accounting for $2 . 3 \mathrm { - } 3 . 2 \%$

# 3.2.Quantitative contribution of resistance sources to stack electrolysis durability

Durability test of the SOEC stack undera constant electrolysis current density of 0.8 A $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ was conducted up to $4 0 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ The mixture of hydrogen and steam with $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } / \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } = 9 0 / 1 0$ was introduced to the hydrogen electrode.The variation voltage curves of the stack,SRU1#,SRU $^ { 2 \# }$ ,UC1# and UC $^ { 2 \# }$ with time are shown in Fig.3a.It indicated that the degradation rate of the stack reached $4 . 3 \% / 1 0 0 \mathrm { h }$ within $3 8 0 \mathrm { h }$ ,and the variation voltage curves of the SRU 1# and SRU $^ { 2 \# }$ were almost consistent.The degradation rate of the SRUs reached $4 . 5 \% / 1 0 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,and that of the corresponding UCs was

Fig the UC after electrolysis operation.

$3 . 7 \% / 1 0 0 \mathrm { h }$ .The degradation of the UC accounted for $8 2 . 2 \%$ of that of theSRU.Theresultsforthe SRU#1andSRU#2beforeandafter electrolysis are summarized in Table 2.

Fig.3b and c shows the variations of the ASRs of the UC,air electrode contact, hydrogen electrode contact and interconnect with time where the ASRs were measured and calculated via voltage measurements [12,15]. The air electrode CR slightly dropped within $1 1 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,and then continuously increased,the hydrogen electrode CR and the UC resistance continuously increased with time,and the interconnect resistance remained unchanged and negligible $( 0 . 0 0 1 \Omega \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } ;$ .Theresistance of the UC rose by $5 9 . 1 \%$ ,the air electrode CR rose by $3 7 . 0 \%$ and the hydrogen electrode CR rose by $1 1 6 . 9 \%$ These three sources contributed to the degradation of the SRU,which had a resistance increase by $5 5 \%$ .Among these three factors,the UC resistance increase was the main reason leading to the degradation of the SRU.

Microstructures of the stack components were examined using SEM.Fig.4a and b illustrate the cross-section images of the cell before and after electrolysis operation. The microstructure of the UC exhibited minimal change after electrolysis operation except parts of the LSFC-GDC air electrode delamination from the GDC, which could be the main factor that caused the cell degradation. Fig. 4c shows the cross section morphology and surface morphology of the AECCL on the UC after electrolysis operation. It can be seen that the AECCL was combined well with the cell,while the contact traces left by the metal interconnect on the AECCL surface were vague (the inserted figure),indicatingweak contact between the metal interconnect and the AEcCL.The weak contact may deteriorate during operation,which results in increasing the air electrode CR with increase of the operation time.Fig.4d shows the cross section morphology of the HECCL on the UC after electrolysis operation.The agglomeration of Ni particles in the HECCL and delamination of the HEcCL by the hydrogen electrode of the cell can be observed.The agglomeration of Ni particles could cause the decrease of the conductivity during the stack operation [17], and the delamination of HECCL could cause the decrease of electron conduction in the stack.Both could result in the continuously increase of the hydrogen electrode CR.

# 4. Conclusions

The quantitative contribution of resistance sources of components to the stack performance was investigated in a NiO-YSZ/YSZ/

GDC/LSCF-GDC SOEC stack at $7 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ Theresults indicated that during instantaneous $_ { \mathrm { I - V } }$ testing the UC was the main factor that influenced the stack performance,the air electrode CR was the second factor that influenced the stack performance,and the hydrogen electrode CR was the third factor that influenced the stack performance,while the resistance of the interconnect was small and could be neglected.When the durability of the stack was conducted under a constant electrolysis current densityof $0 . 8 \mathrm { \ A c m } ^ { - 2 }$ for $3 8 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,the increasing resistance of the UC was the mainreason for the degradation of the SRU,and the air electrode CR was another important factor that influenced the stack degradation.Inaddition,the hydrogen electrode CRwasalso an innegligible factor that influenced the stack degradation.
