# ABSTRACT

The lipid droplet(LD)isacelularorganelle that stores neutral lipids incellsand has been linked with metabolic disorders.Caenorhabditis elegans has manycharacteristics which make it an excellnt animal model for studying LDs.However,unlike in mammalian cells,no LD structure-like/resident proteins have been identified in C.elegans,which has limited the utilityof this model for the study of lipid storageand metabolism.Herein based onthreelines ofevidence,we identified that MDT-28and DHS-3 previously identified in C.elegans LD proteome were two LD structure-like/resident proteins.First,MDT-28 and DHS-3 were found to be the two most abundant LD proteins in the worm.Second,the proteins were specifically localized to LDs and we identified thedomains responsible for this targeting in both proteins.Third and most importantly,the depletion of MDT28 induced LD clustering while DHS-3 deletion reduced triacylglycerol content (TAG).We further characterized the proteinsfinding that MDT-28 was ubiquitously expressed in the intestine,muscle,hypodermis,and embryos, whereas DHS-3 was expressed mainly in intestinal cells.Together,these two LD structure-like/resident proteins provide a basis for future mechanistic studies into the dynamicsand functions of LDs in C.elegans.

# 1. Introduction

The current upswing in research interest in lipid droplets (LDs) has been fueled by their connection to human metabolic disorders, the importance of neutral lipids in food products,and the development of biofuels [1-5].LDs have been found in almost all organisms from bacteria to mammals and throughout most cell types in multicellular organisms [5,6].LDs are a cellular organelle that consists of a neutral lipid core covered with a monolayer phospholipid membrane and proteins.The core contains triacylglycerol (TAG),cholesterol esters,and ether lipids[7].LD-associated proteins have been identified in many species,from bacteria to humans [5],and can be categorized into four groups:LD structure-like/resident,lipid synthetic and metabolic,membrane traffic,and cell signaling proteins [8].Perilipin [9] and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) [10,11] are considered LD structure-like/resident proteins.They belongto the Perilipin family(PLINs),which includes three other members:Tip47[12],S3-12[13] and OXPAT[14].PLIN family proteins are only expressed in mammals and Drosophila[15].

Further,LDs have been observed to be closely linked both at a molecular level of communication and also proximity to endoplasmic reticulum[16,17],early endosomes [18],mitochondria[19],peroxisome [20],and other cellular organelles [21],implyinga possible role for LDs in energy metabolism regulation and intracellular lipid trafficking. Although LDsare an important cellular organelle and its research has significant progresses in last decade, the mechanisms behind LD formation,morphological changes and functions remain elusive.

LDs have been studied in many organisms,providing opportunities for comparative analyses.Among them C.elegans stands out as an excellent animal model, not only due to the ease of genetic manipulation and visualization,but also because of the demonstrated linkages between fat storage,metabolism,reproduction,and the animal's lifespan [22-26]. Our previous study provided a shotgun proteome and identified a LD marker protein DHS-3.However, the utility of this animal model for LDresearch has been limited due to a lack of knowledge regarding LD structure-like/resident proteins [25,27,28].

Following up on our previous study where we identified a LD marker protein,DHS-3,in C.elegans[29],we have performed a comprehensive proteomic study of LDs isolated from C.elegans.We have identified two major LD proteins in the animal, MDT-28 and DHS-3.Both proteins were localized to LDs by fluorescence microscopy.DHS-3 was only expressed in the intestine,whereas MDT-28 was located in most tissues. We used mutational analysis to identify the regions of the proteins responsible for LD targeting.Finally,we demonstrated that the depletion of MDT-28 induces LD clustering while DHS-3 deletion reduces TAG. These data indicate that MDT-28 and DHS-3 are two LD structure-like/ resident proteins in the worm,which will facilitate the study of LDs and lipid metabolism in this important animal model.

# 2.1.Strains and culture conditions

The N2 Bristol strain of C.elegans was used as wild type in this study. The dhs-3(gk873395）worm was provided by the Caenorbhabditis Genetics Center (CGC）at the University of Minnesota.The mdt28(tm1704) and F22F7.1(tm5652) worms were provided by National BioResource Project(NBRP).The Pdhs-3::dhs-3::GFP,Pmdt-28::mdt28::mCherry,and PF22F7.1::F22F7.1::GFP worms were constructed in our laboratory.Strains Pvha-6::dhs-3::GFP(single copy) and Pmdt28::mdt-28::mRuby (single copy) were generated by professor Ho Yi Mak.Muscle and hypodermis specific expression markers Pmyo-3:GFP andPceh-14::GFP were crossed with Pmdt-28:mdt-28:mCherry to illuminate the tissue distribution of MDT-28.The Pvha-6::dhs-3:GFP, mdt-28,Pvha-6::dhs-3::GFP,F22F7.1,Pvha-6::dhs-3::GFP,mdt-28,and F22F7.1 strains were prepared by our laboratory for the mdt-28 and F22F7.1 phenotype study.All worms were maintained on agar plates seeded with an OP5O bacterial lawn using a standard protocol.

The CHO K2 cell line was cultured by a method described previously [30] and used for the DHS-3 and MDT-28 lipid droplet targeting experiment.

# 2.2.Isolation of lipid droplets

LDs were isolated by the method previously described [29,31]. First, about $4 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ young adults were harvested and washed with Phosphate BufferedSaline (PBS) $/ 0 . 0 0 1 \%$ Triton-X1oo and suspended in $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ buffer A( $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ Tricine,pH 7.6, $2 5 0 \ \mathrm { m M }$ sucrose,and $0 . 2 \ \mathrm { m M }$ phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride),followed by homogenizationusinga Polytron(Cole-Parmer $\textsuperscript { \textregistered }$ LabgenTM 125 and 700 Tissue Homogenizers). The homogenate was centrifuged at $1 0 0 0 g$ for $3 0 \ : s$ .The supernatant was homogenized again by nitrogen cavitation (Ashcroft Duralife Pressure Gauge)aftera $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ ,750 pounds per square inch(PSI) incubation on ice,and was then centrifuged at $1 0 0 0 g$ for10 min. 9 ml of postnuclear supernatant(PNS),was collected and loaded into an SW40 tube.The homogenate was overlaid with $3 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of buffer B ( $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ HEPES,pH7.4,100 mM KCl,and $2 \mathrm { m M M g C l _ { 2 } }$ )and was centrifuged at $_ { 1 2 , 6 2 8 g }$ for $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ TheLD fractionwas carefully collected from top layer of the gradient and washed with 2Oo 1buffer B3 times.For embryonic LD isolation,the embryoswere harvested usinga bleach method [32]. Briefly, $4 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } 3 \ – 4$ day old adults were collected into a $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ tube and resuspended in a $7 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of $\mathrm { \ d d H } _ { 2 } 0$ $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of $5 ~ \mathrm { N } ~ \mathrm { N a O H }$ and $2 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of bleach buffer ( $5 \%$ solution of sodium hypochlorite）were added and then vortexed briefly.The sample was incubated at room temperature until the worms dissolved (usually $5 { - } 8 \mathrm { m i n }$ ).Thesample was then centrifuged for $1 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $_ { 1 5 0 0 ~ g . }$ 、The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed 5 times.The same LD isolation procedure described above was then carried out,starting with the nitrogen cavitation.

# 2.3.Protein preparation and Western blot

Proteins were precipitated using $100 \%$ acetone,and were collected by centrifugationat $2 0 { , } 0 0 0 { \ g }$ for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .Protein pellets were dissolved in $2 \times { \mathsf { S D S } }$ sample bufferatafinal concentration ofabout $1 \mathrm { m g / m l }$ for

# 2.4.Mass spectrometry analysis

Lipid droplet proteins were separated on a $1 0 \%$ SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to colloidal-blue staining.The lane with LD proteins was cut into 34 slices.In-gel digestion of each slice was performed as follows: First,the gel was dehydrated with $100 \%$ acetonitrile and then the proteins were reduced with $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ DTT in $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ ammonium bicarbonate at $5 6 ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 1 \mathrm { h } }$ .The proteins were then alkylated using $5 5 \mathrm { m M }$ iodoacetamide in $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ ammonium bicarbonate in the dark at room temperature for $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ Finally,the gel pieceswere thoroughly washed with $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ ammonium bicarbonate in water-acetonitrile $( 1 { : } 1 , \nu / \nu )$ （204 solution and were completely dried in a SpeedVac.Then proteins were incubated with 10 ltrypsin solution ( $1 0 \mathrm { n g / }$ lin $2 5 \mathrm { m M }$ ammonium bicarbonate) for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ on ice.30-40 1of $2 5 \mathrm { m M }$ ammonium bicarbonate was added after removing the excess enzyme solution.12 hours later, $5 \%$ formic acid was added to stop the digestion reaction. A ${ \sf C } _ { 1 8 }$ trap column was used to capture the peptide solution,which was eluted and then subjected to nano-LC-ESI-LTQ MS/MS analysis.The LTQ mass spectrometer was operated under data-dependent mode and was set at an initial 4oo-2ooo Da MS scan range.The five most abundant ions were selected for subsequent collision-activated dissociation.All MS/ MS data were searched against the C.elegans protein database Wormpep218.

# 2.5.LipiddroplettargetingsequencesofMDT-28andDHS-3

Following hydrophobicity and secondary structure prediction,DNA coding for DHS-3 was truncated into three fragments coding for amino acids1-50,50-150,and150-307.The fragmentsand full length of DHS-3 were ligated into EGFP-N1,and were then transfected into CHOK2 cells.After12 hours,the cellswere harvested and fixed with $4 \%$ PFA for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ,permeabilized with $0 . 0 2 \%$ Triton X-100 for $8 \mathrm { m i n }$ and then stained with LipidTox deep red for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .The prepared sampleswere examined using confocal microscopy. Similarly,MDT-28 was fragmented into three pieces (coding for 1-210,210-275,275-418 amino acids),ligated to EGFP-N1,and then transfected into the CHO K2 cells for fluorescence microscopy.

# 2.6.Staining and confocal microscopy

For the neutral lipid dye feeding approach,the three dyes (Nile red, Bodipy,LipidTox) were diluted1:10oO with PBS and 2O0 lof the mixture wasapplied to an OP5O lawn ina Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plate.Then Pdhs-3::dhs-3::GFPL4 stage worms were transferred onto the plate.The worms were ready for live image observation after 12 hours.

Fixed Oil Red O and Nile red staining of adult worms was carried out aspreviously described[29,33].The stained worms were laid on a $2 \%$ agarplate,and then subjected for confocal image analysis.For fixed Bodipy staining of embryos,we used the same protocol as for the fixed Nile red staining of adult worms.
