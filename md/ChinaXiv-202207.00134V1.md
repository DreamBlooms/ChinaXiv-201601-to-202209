Abstract: Roots exert pullout resistance under pullout force, allowing plants to resist uprooting. However, the pullout resistance characteristics of taproot-type shrub species of different ages remain unclear. In this study,in order to improve our knowledge of pullout resistance characteristics of taproot systems of shrub species,we selected the shrub species Caragana korsbinski Kom.in different growth periods as the research plant and conducted in situ root pullout test. The relationships among the maximum pullout resistance, peak root displacement, shrub growth period,and aboveground growth indices (plant height and plant crown breadth) were analyzed,as well as the mechanical process of uprooting. Pullout resistance of 4-15 year-old $C .$ korsbinskii ranged from 2.49 $( \pm 0 . 2 5 )$ to 14.71 $( \pm 4 . 9 6 \$ ） kN,and the peak displacement ranged from 11.77 $( \pm 8 . 6 1 ) \$ to 26.50 $( \pm 1 6 . 0 9 )$ cm. The maximum pullout resistance and the peak displacement of roots increased as a power function ( $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 9 0 3 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ and a linear function $\scriptstyle \prime { \mathrm { R } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 8 2 4 2 { \mathrm { , } }$ ）with increasing age, respectively. The maximum pullout resistance and the peak displacement increased with increasing plant height; however,this relationship was not significant. The maximum pulout resistance increased exponentially ( $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 5 5 2 2 )$ as the crown breadth increased. There was no significant relationship between the peak displacement and crown breadth. The pulout resistance and displacement curve were divided into three stages: the initial nonlinear growth,linear growth,and nonlinear stages.Two modes of failure of a single root occurred when the roots were subjected to vertical loading forces: the synchronous breakage mode and the periderm preferential breakage mode. These findings provide a foundation for further investigation of the soil reinforcement and slope protection mechanisms of this shrub species in the loess area of northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.

# 1 Introduction

When plants are subjected to external loading forces on their surfaces,such as runoff and wind, or landslide loads,the roots below the ground or sliding surfaces must withstand pullout force. Under pullout force,the root-soil interactions result in pullout resistance, which ensures that the plant can withstand uprooting by external loading forces,and provides an anchoring effect in shallow slope soil (Wu et al.，1979；Waldron and Dakessan，1981; Crook and Ennos,1996; Stokes et al., 2009; Schwarz et al.,2011). Therefore,according to the characteristics of pullout resistance of plant roots,researchers assessed the windbreak and sand fixation abilities of plants, as well as their effects on water and soil conservation,and slope protection (Stokes et al.,1996; Norris, 2005; van Beek et al., 2005; Stubbs et al., 2019).

The characteristics of pullout resistance of plant roots include both the root pullout resistance and its influencing factors.Numerous studies have obtained the pullout resistance of roots of different plants via pullout test. Researchers have studied the effects of many pullout resistance influencing factors,including the type of root system， the root morphological indices，the aboveground growth indices,the tensile mechanical properties of a single root,the plant growth period,and the physical and mechanical properties of soils based on pullout test and numerical simulations (Mickovski and Ennos,2003; Dupuy et al., 2005; Burylo et al., 2009; Stokes et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2014).

The type of root system is a key factor influencing the characteristics of plant root pullout resistance (Stokes et al.,1996; Ali et al.,2O13). Tree roots have been classified into three main types: tap, heart,and flat roots (Kostler et al.,1968). Plants possessing heart and taproot systems are the most resistant to uprooting (Dupuy et al.,2OO5; Stokes et al.,2009), especially the vertical taproot(Yang et al., 2O17; Yang et al., 2O18). In addition,the branching angle between lateral roots and taproot also affects the characteristics of pullout resistance of taproot system (Fourcaud et al.,20O8; Ali et al., 2O13). The root morphological indices include the total surface area, total volume, total length, dry weight,and the number of lateral roots (Dupuy et al.,2Oo5; Yang et al., 2021).For different types of plant roots，these root morphological indices are positively correlated with root pulout resistance.Especially,the root surface area is beter than other indices for reflecting pullout resistance (Yang et al., 2O21). In addition, the aboveground growth indices, such as plant height, diameter at breast height, stem basal diameter,and crown biomass are important traits related to root pullout resistance (Cucchi et al.,2OO4; Burylo et al.,2O09). The tensile mechanical properties of a single root include single root tensile force, single root tensile strength,single root limit extensile rate,root elastic modulus,and root stiffness are also key factors influencing root pullout resistance (Genet et al.,2O05; Mickovski et al.,2OO7; Boldrin et al.,2017; Zhang et al.,2O19). And the tensile mechanical properties are intrinsic factors that determine the deformation and failure of roots when subjected to pullout forces (Wu et al.,1979; Mickovski et al., 2007; Schwarz et al., 2011).

Plant roots grow continuously,resulting in an obvious temporal effect on plant uprooting. Thus, the characteristics of pullout resistance of plant roots are dynamic (Scippa et al.,2Oo6; Stokes et al.,2009). Zhang et al. (2O12) conducted in situ pullout test to assess the pullout resistance of four shrubs with growth periods of 1-4 a in the Xining Basin, China. Their results revealed that the root pullout resistance of the four shrub species increased as a power function,a linear function, and an exponential function with an increasing growth period. The root pullout resistance was also influenced by the soil physical and mechanical properties,such as soil moisture content, density,and shear strength (Mickovski et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 202O). Affected by root types, the relationship between root pullout resistance and soil moisture content is variable; for example, studies have found that root pullout resistance initially increased with soil moisture content, and then decreased (Wang et al., 2Ol7),or root pullout resistance decreased linearly as soil moisture content increased (Schwarz et al.，2011; Zhang et al.，202O). The greater the soil density， the greater the shear strength of root-soil interface，which results in an increase in root pullout resistance (Su et al.,2O2O). When plant roots are uprooted, the soil around the roots willresist the shear stress；hence,the soil shear strength directly affects the stability of root-soil interface (Ennos,1989; Zhou et al., 1998).

The root material and soil matrix are elastic-plastic materials. When roots are subjected to uprooting,the transmission of force between roots and soil is a complex nonlinear process (Ennos, 1989;Norris, 2Oo5). Previous studies have investigated the pullout behaviors of roots being pulld out through analyzing root pullout resistance and displacement curves with pullout test (Ennos,1989; Ennos,1990; Bailey et al.,2002;Mickovski et al.,2005;Mickovski et al.,2007; Schwarz et al.,2011; Tian et al., 2014; Su et al.,202O). The characteristics of mechanical process and failure mode of the roots being pulled out can be determined by displacement curves.

Although studies have investigated the characteristics of root pullout resistance， the relationship between root pullout resistance and plant growth period, especially for shrub species with longer growth periods is less concerned. In addition, there are few reports on the root pullout resistance of perennial shrub species in the loess area of northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.The objectives of this study were: (1） to determine the relationship between root pullout resistance and plant growth period;(2） to investigate the relationship between root pullout resistance and aboveground plant growth indices, including plant height and plant crown breadth; and (3) to analyze the mechanical process and failure modes by which taproot-type shrub species resist uprooting. The results of this study would provide a foundation for further investigation of soil reinforcement and slope protection by shrub species in the loess area.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1Study site

Northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is located at the intersection between sub-humid temperate continental monsoon climate zone,inland arid zone,and the high-cold area in eastern China. Loess is widely distributed and characterized by high sediment thickness and relatively complete strata.The Xining Basin and its surrounding areas are the main loess sedimentary area in northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Tan et al.,2OO6). Due to the neotectonic movement, the loess in this area has been strongly eroded and cut,resulting in the extensive development of gullies and a landscape characterized by ridges,shoulders,tablelands,and loess hills (Zhuang et al., 2016).Most of precipitation in the Xining Basin occurs in the form of rainstorms and showers, which are characterized by short durations and high intensities (Liu et al.,2O21).The slopes in this area are characterized by large gradients and low vegetation coverage，so the rainfall infiltration depth is relatively shallow，which has led to the frequent occurrence of shallow landslides,debris flows,soil erosion,and other geological disasters in the study area (Hu et al., 2013; Zhuang et al., 2016).

A site located in the Dayou Mountains in the northern Xining City, Qinghai Province, China was selected as the study area (Fig. la). The study site had a slope gradient of $2 4 ^ { \circ } - 4 3 ^ { \circ }$ with a northeast-facing orientation and $2 3 5 0 { - } 2 4 5 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ a.s.l. elevation. The main vegetation includes shrub C. korshinskii and other natural herb species. C. korshinskii were artificially sown in 2001 (Fig. 1b). The soil physical properties are summarized in Table 1.

# 2.2 Plant properties

C. korshinski is a perennial shrub species that is widely distributed on northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. C. korshinskii has taproot-type roots that consist of a deep taproot and many lateral roots (Niu et al.,2Oo3). C. korshinskii is highly adaptable and is resistant to cold and drought, which is ideal for soil and water conservation, and slope stabilization in cold and arid regions (Hu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2021).

# 2.3In situ pull out test

Intact C. korshinskii plants were randomly selected. The slope gradient of the selected plant growth position was $2 4 ^ { \circ } - 3 0 ^ { \circ }$ .A self-constructed instrument was used for in situ pullout test. The instrument was composed of a triangular bracket, a hand chain hoist,a clamp,a tension sensor (measurement range of $3 0  { \mathrm { k N } }$ and accuracy of $0 . 5 \%$ ),a guyed displacement sensor (measurement range of $1 0 0 \mathrm { c m }$ and accuracy of $0 . 5 \%$ ),a data acquisition system,a laptop,and batteries.In situ pullout test instrument is displayed in Figure 2.

Prior to in situ pullout test, plant height and plant crown breadth of each selected plant were measured using a steel ruler, and plant growth period was determined from annual rings in the stem. After this, plant stems and leaves were cut off,in situ pullut test instrument was assembled, and clamp was attached to the plant stem just above the ground surface.Before in situ pullout test was conducted, hand chain hoist was stretched tightly,and it was maintained on the same plumb line with plant stem,but plant roots were not subjected to tension.At the same time, software on the laptop was used to initialize tension sensor and guyed displacement sensor, and begin the data acquisition system. Then,the chain was manually operated at a constant speed of $2 0 \mathrm { c m / m i n }$ (average pullout rate, $2 1 . 5 0 \ : ( \pm 3 . 7 1 ) \ : \mathrm { c m / m i n } )$ until root pullout resistance exceeded the peak value,and no further interaction occurred between roots and surrounding soils.Data acquisition system continuously collected pullout resistance and displacement of plant roots with an acquisition rate of 5O times per second,and these data were displayed on the software page of laptop terminal. After the test, software saved the test data automatically. In this study,a total of $4 2 ~ C .$ korshinskii plants were selected for in situ pullout test. These plants had growth periods of 4, 5,6,7,9,12,and 15 a. Sample numbers and aboveground growth indices of these plant species are summarized in Table 2.

In situ pullout test was conducted from 31 August, 2021 to 7 September, 2021. There was light rain (24 h rainfall, less than $1 0 \mathrm { m m } ,$ on 5 September, 2O21,and the weather was sunny and cloudy on other days. Rainfall infiltration depth of this type of rainfall in the loess area is less than $3 0 \mathrm { c m }$ (Wang et al.,2O21).In order to avoid rainfall infiltration affecting the test results,we measured soil moisture content with the depth of $0 { - } 3 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ around the roots before and after rainfall. The test could be continued when there was no significant difference between soil moisture contents around plant roots after and before rainfall. Thus, no tests were carried out from 5 September to the afternoon of 6 September.

# 2.4 Statistical analysis

Regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationships of the maximum root pullout resistance and the peak displacement (the displacement corresponding to the maximum pullout resistance) with growth period of C. korshinskii.Regression analysis and correlation analysis also revealed the relationships of the maximum root pullout resistance and the peak displacement with plant height and plant crown breadth. Classification of correlation coefficients and correlation strengths are shown in Table 3 (Xie et al.,2O13). All of the statistical analyses were performed using the Origin v.8.0 software.

# 3 Results

# 3.1Relationship between root pullout resistance and plant growth period

The maximum root pullout resistance increased as a power function as plant growth periods increased (Fig.3a).As plant growth periods increased from 4 to $_ \textrm { 7 a }$ ，the maximum root pullout resistance increased from 2.49 $( \pm 0 . 2 5 )$ to 4.79 $( \pm 1 . 0 6 )$ ）kN.Values of the maximum root pullout resistance at different growth periods were not significantly different $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ . The maximum root pullout resistance with a low increase rate of $1 3 . 8 6 \%$ for plants growth periods from 4 to $6 \mathrm { a }$ and a relatively high increase rate of $5 0 . 3 4 \%$ for plants growth periods from 6 to 7 a. As plant growth periods increased from 7 to $9 \mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ，the maximum root pullout resistance increased from 4.79 $( \pm 1 . 0 6 )$ to $7 . 2 0 ~ ( \pm 2 . 3 8 ) ~ \mathrm { k N }$ with an increase rate of $4 8 . 0 0 \%$ . However, there was a significant difference in the maximum root pullout resistance between plant growth period of 9 a and those of 4, 5, and 6 a $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ . As plant growth periods increased from 12 to $1 5 \mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ，the maximum root pullout resistance increased from 12.84 $( \pm 4 . 4 5 )$ to $1 4 . 7 1 \ \left( \pm 4 . 9 6 \right) \ \mathrm { k N }$ with an increase rate of $5 . 0 6 \%$ $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ . The maximum root pullout resistance for plant growth period of 12 a was significantly higher than that of $9 \mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ,with an increase rate of $7 8 . 4 5 \%$ ：

As shown in Figure 3b, the peak displacement of $C .$ korshinskii roots increased linearly as growth periods increased.As growth periods extended from 4 to $1 5 \mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ,the peak displacement of $C .$ korshinskii roots increased from 11.77 $( \pm 8 . 6 1 ) \$ to 26.50 $( \pm 1 6 . 0 9 )$ cm.Difference between the peak displacement of the C. korshinskii roots at different growth periods was not significant $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$

# 3.2 Relationships of root pullout resistance with plant height and plant crown breadth

As displayed in Figure 4,as plant height of $C .$ ，korshinskii increased, the maximum root pullout resistance and peak displacement increased. However, the maximum root pullout resistance and peak displacement did not exhibit a significant functional relationship with plant height. And the correlation coefficients between these two indices and plant heights were 0.599 and 0.261, respectively.

Fig.4Relationships of the maximum root pulout resistance (a)and peak displacement (b)with height of $C .$ 4 korshinskii

As illustrated in Figure 5a,the maximum root pullout resistance increased exponentially （204号 $( R ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 5 5 2 2 )$ ）as plant crown breadth increased, but relationship between peak displacement and plant crown breadth was not significant (Fig.5b). Correlation coefficients of the maximum root pullout resistance and peak displacement with plant crown breadth were O.668 and 0.007, respectively. Thus,a moderate correlation between the maximum pullout resistance and plant crown breadth existed.

As plant height increased, plant crown breadth increased too (Fig. 6). There was no significant functional relationship between plant height and plant crown breadth.Correlation analysis demonstrated that correlation coefficient between plant height and plant crown breadth of $C .$ korshinskii was 0.612.

# 3.3Characteristics of root pullout resistance, displacement curve,and root failure mode of C. korshinskii

Root pullout resistance and displacement curve of C.korshinskii obtained from in situ pullout test are shown in Figure 7. In this study, pullout resistance and displacement curve were divided into three stages: initial nonlinear growth stage (O-A), linear growth stage (A-B),and nonlinear stage (B-C) (Fig. 7a-c). In initial nonlinear growth stage,root pullout resistance increased nonlinearly as displacement increased,and the curve was concave.After initial nonlinear stage,the curve entered linear growth stage. In this stage,root pullout resistance increased nearly linearly with increasing displacement, and the curve was approximately a straight line. Linear growth stage terminated at point B,which was also the beginning of nonlinear stage (Fig. 7a-c). At nonlinear stage,root pullout resistance reached the maximum value,after which root pullout resistance decreased as displacement increased. At nonlinear stage,the curve was jagged, and there were serval peaks.

Two modes of failure in a single root occurred when C. korshinskii roots were subjected to vertical loading forces (Fig.7d). In the first mode,the periderm and the secondary vascular tissues of a single root were broken at the same time and at the same point (synchronous breakage mode),and the root diameter at the broken position was less than $1 2 . 5 5 \ \mathrm { m m }$ In the second mode, the periderm was broken first，and the secondary vascular tissue was puled out along the periderm inner wall (periderm preferential breakage mode).Among $4 2 \ C .$ korshinskii plants, $5 7 . 1 4 \%$ and $1 1 . 4 3 \%$ of roots were broken in synchronous breakage mode and periderm preferential breakage mode,respectively，while $3 1 . 4 3 \%$ of broken roots combined these two modes.In this study,there was no test in which the roots were completely pulled out of the soil.

# 4Discussion

# 4.1Variations of root pullout resistance and plant traits of C. korshinskii

In this study,the relationship of the maximum root pullout resistance and the peak displacement of $C .$ korshinskii with plant growth periods was investigated. Results indicated that the maximum root pullout resistance increased as a power function ( $\scriptstyle ( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 0 3 8 )$ with increasing growth periods. This was mainly related to root depth and lateral root number of $C .$ ，korshinskii.Growth periods of C. korshinskii could be divided into young age (1-6 a), middle age (6-14 a),and old age $\mathrm { ( > 1 4 ~ a ) }$ ） (Cheng et al.,2Oo5). Previous research has shown that root depth of $C .$ .korshinskii with a growth period of 2-4 a is $1 . 5 0 { - } 4 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ (Niu et al., 2Oo3). In the middle and old ages,root distribution depth can reach about $7 . 0 0 { - } 1 8 . 0 0 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (Hu，1985; Cheng et al.，2005；Wang et al.,2015). In addition, lateral root number of $C$ 、korshinskii with a growth period of 2-4 a is 8-39 (Niu et al., 2003). Therefore,root depth and lateral root number of $C .$ korshinskii increased with increasing growth periods (Niu et al.,2Oo3). The greater the root depth and lateral root number,the greater the interaction area and normal stress between root and soil,and the greater the maximum root pullout resistance (Stokes et al., 1996; Stokes et al., 2009;Ali et al.,2013).

Root peak displacement increased as a linear function ( $R ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 8 2 4 2 \$ ）with increasing plant growth periods.This is because longer growth periods lead to longer root lengths, increased tortuosity and higher lateral root numbers of $C .$ ，korshinskii.Then,larger displacementisrequired to overcome the maximum root pullout resistance (Ennos,1989; Mickovski et al., 20O7; Schwarz et al.,2O11). Owing to the randomness of root failure positions and the complexity of root architecture in C. korshinski, the value range and discrete degree of root peak displacement of $C .$ korshinskii were large at the same growth periods,resulting in no significant difference between root peak displacement and different growth periods $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ ：

Previous studies have shown that root traits have important effects on root pullout resistance (Dupuy et al.,2005; Stokes et al.,2009; Tian et al., 2014). However,if an empirical relationship between aboveground growth indices and root pullout resistance can be established, it will be convenient in assessing root pulout resistance in the field.In this study,results indicated that there was a moderate correlation between the maximum root pullout resistance and the height of C.korshinskii $\scriptstyle ( r = 0 . 5 9 9 )$ . This result was consistent with those of other plant species (Cucchi et al., 2004; Mickovski et al.,2005; Tanaka et al.,2011; Liu et al.,2013). In other words,the larger the plant, the higher its root pullout resistance (Liu et al., 2Ol3). In addition, a moderate correlation between the maximum root pullout resistance and plant crown breadth ( $_ { \cdot = 0 . 6 6 8 }$ ）was obtained. By comparing correlation coefficient $( r )$ and goodness of fit $( R ^ { 2 } )$ ，we found that plant crown of $C$ korshinskii had a beter correlation with root pullout resistance than plant height. Therefore, root pullout resistance of C. korshinskii can be estimated in the field by plant crown. In this study, a weak correlation was found between root peak displacement and its aboveground growth indices, which was related to the discrete degree of peak displacement data.

# 4.2 Mechanical processof uprootingofC.korshinskii

Characteristics of root pullout resistance and displacement curves reflect the root-soil interactions under external loading forces.Mechanics of uprooting involve processes that occurred in both root material and sediment matrix in which the root is located (Edmaier et al.,2O14). In this study, root pullout resistance and displacement curve were divided into three stages: initial nonlinear growth,linear growth,and nonlinear stages. Initial nonlinear growth stage (Fig. 7a-c) occurred because tortuous roots that were closer to the source of vertical loading forces, needed to be straightened out when they were subjected to vertical loading forces (Commandeur and Pyles, 1991).

After initial nonlinear stage, the roots closest to the source of vertical loading forces underwent elastic deformation as vertical loading forces increased (Tian et al.,2O14).Then, shear stress was induced at the root-soil interface (Ennos,1989; Schwarz et al.,2010).At this time,root pullout resistance was determined by both root strength and shear strength of root-soil interactions. Within the range of elastic limit, the maximum shear stress at root-soil interface increased linearly as vertical loading forces increased (Schwarz et al., 2O1O). Consequently,at linear growth stage (Fig.7a-c),root pullout resistance increased nearly linearly with increasing displacement (Tian et al.,2014). This stage also occurred in root pullout resistance and displacement curves of other studies,which were obtained via in situ pullout test with the roots of other plant species (Norris, 2005; Liu et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2014).

As vertical loading forces increased,once the shear stress at root-soil interface exceeded the elastic limit of root-soil interface or the soil around the root,root-soil interface entered the plastic deformation stage (Fig.7a-c),resulting in plastic slip deformation (Schwarz et al., 2O1O; Tian et al.，2014). Plastic slip deformation zone extended along root-soil interface as load forces increased. At this stage, as plastic slip deformation Zone expanded, elastic and shear stress Zone at root-soil interface， which was below plastic slip deformation zone， moved downward continuously along root surface,and the maximum shear stress in plastic slip deformation zone increased as load forces increased (Schwarz et al.,2O1O; Su et al., 2O2O).Thus,at this stage, root pullout resistance and displacement curve did not increase linearly any further. Theoretically, root pullout resistance should have increased nonlinearly until entire lower region of root-soil interface entered plastic deformation stage or breakage (Ennos,1989). If root tensile strengths were greater than the maximum shear stress at each root-soil interface,root-soil interface of entire roots would enter plastic slip deformation state. Then, whole roots would separate from soil and slip out of ground (Norris,2Oo5; Schwarz et al., 201O). In contrast, taproot and lateral roots would break at the position with the weakest tensile strength along their lengths,resulting in root pullout resistance and displacement curve being jagged (Fig. 7a-c) (Bailey et al., 2002).

# 4.3 Failure modes of uprooting of C.korshinskii

Previous studies have shown that when roots are subjected to pullout force,failure mode of roots is mainly affected by factors including tensile strength of a single root, connection strength at the joints between mother and daughter branches，shear strength of root-soil interface,and root anatomical structure (Wu et al.,1979; Dupuy et al., 2005; Schwarz et al., 2010; Schwarz et al., 2011; Hu et al.,2O13).When tensile stress in a single root (including joints between mother and daughter branches） is less than shear strength of root-soil interface and greater than tensile strength of a single root (or connection strength at the joints between mother and daughter branches),the root will fail at the position with the minimum tensile strength (Norrs,2005). In this study, in situ root pulout test showed that two modes of failure of a single root occurred when a C. korshinskii root was pulled out of the soil: synchronous breakage mode and periderm preferential breakage mode. Synchronous breakage mode was similar to those of previous studies (Noris,2005; Rahardjo et al.,2014; Ji et al.,2016). However, few studies have reported periderm preferential breakage mode in other plant species.

Hu et al.(2O13） studied root anatomical structure of $C$ 、korshinskii through microscopic observations,and found that C. korshinskii roots consisted of periderm,thin wall tissue of middle column sheath,and the secondary vascular tissue from outside to inside.The tensile strength of a single C. korshinski root is mainly provided by periderm and the secondary vascular tissue (Hu et al.,2013).Mechanical properties of periderm and the secondary vascular tissue differ because of differences in their material composition. When a single root of $C .$ ，korshinskii is subjected to tensile stress, periderm and the secondary vascular tissue may not break at the same time and position.

If periderm and the secondary vascular tissue of a single root are broken at a weak position at the same time,synchronous breakage mode has occurred.However, if periderm is broken first, it results in periderm preferential breakage mode.In this mode,shear strength of root-soil interface prevents periderm below breakpoint from being pulled out of soil,and shear strength of root-soil interface no longer plays a role in root pullout resistance. Thus,the secondary vascular tissue bears tensile stress by itself after periderm breakage,and it slips out along inner wall of periderm easily.This occurs because there is tissue fluid in the thin wall tissue of middle column sheath that can provide lubrication between periderm and the secondary vascular tissue. The secondary vascular tissue may break at the weakest position in its lower region later (Fig. 7d).

# 5 Conclusions

In this study，we found that the maximum root pullout resistance and the peak displacement increased as a power function and a linear function with the extension of plant growth periods, respectively. The maximum root pullout resistance increased exponentially with increasing plant crown breadth. Root pullout resistance and displacement curve were divided into three stages: an initial nonlinear growth stage,a linear growth stage,and a nonlinear stage. Synchronous breakage mode and periderm preferential breakage mode were found to be prevalent failure modes of single roots during C. korshinskii uprooting. However,it was difficult to analyze the relationship between root pullout resistance and root characteristics,as well as the relationship between root characteristics and plant aboveground growth indices，because roots obtained through in situ pullout test were incomplete,and the characteristics of complete roots could not be measured.Moreover, there were unavoidable differences in plant site conditions in the field. Future studies should thus explore the characteristics of root pullout resistance via numerical simulation based on investigation of root distribution characteristics.The results of this study can serve as a theoretical foundation for further investigation of soil reinforcement and slope protection mechanisms of this shrub species in the loess area of northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Furthermore,the dynamic changes in root characteristics of shrub species in the loess area of northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with the increasing plant growth periods will be the focus of future research.
