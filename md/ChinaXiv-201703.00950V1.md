A series of $\mathsf { L a } _ { 1 - x } \mathsf { B a } _ { x } \mathsf { C o O } _ { 3 } \left( x = 0 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 3 \right)$ perovskites were synthesized by the modified sol-gel method, and their activities for NO oxidation were investigated as well.The relevant structural characterizations of the prepared catalysts were conducted by XRD，ICP，BET，FTIR,TEM, ${ \sf H } _ { 2 }$ -TPR and NO-TPD.The performance evaluation indicated that introduction of Ba at the A-site in $\mathsf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ greatly improved the activity for NO oxidation.The best performance with NO conversion of $9 3 \%$ at $2 6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ was obtained on $\mathsf { L a } _ { 0 . 9 } \mathsf { B a } _ { 0 . 1 } \mathsf { C o O } _ { 3 }$ .Additionally, the Ba-doped $\mathsf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ had better performance than that of the classical $\mathsf { P t } / \mathsf { \Lambda }$ ${ \mathsf { A l } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 3 }$ catalyst,implying that the non-noble catalysts could be considered as potential substituting candidates for noble metal-based catalysts.

# 1.Introduction

Consideringa better fuel economy and power output,lean-burn engines have attracted more attention than conventional engines.1,² However,it is difficult to eliminate NOx under the lean-burn conditions on account of the lack of reductants. Therefore the abatement of NOx becomes quite critical due to the increasing NOx emission regulations because of their harm to human-beings and the environment.At present,selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and lean NOx trap (LNT) are two main technologies for NOx removal.3-6 For SCR technology，the presence of $\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 }$ can promote NOx removal.7, As to LNT technology，also named NOx Storage-Reduction (NSR), $\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 }$ are more effective to be absorbed on catalysts as nitrates than NO. Consequently, the conversion of NO to $\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 }$ is of importance for NOx removal.69 At this instance, the conventional noble metalbased catalysts are employed.A substitution to conventional catalyst needs to be developed due to lower stability and high cost of noble metals.

In the last decades,much attention has been paid to the catalysts derived from perovskite structures with general formula ${ \bf A B O } _ { 3 }$ ,whereAisarareearthcationandBisatransition metal (Co,Ni,Fe or Mn).10-18 During the NOx removal process,the ability for the oxidation of NO to $\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 }$ is significant. $\mathbf { L a M O } _ { 3 }$ 0 $\mathbf { \dot { M } } = \mathbf { C o }$ ,Mn,Fe) perovskites were ever studied as NO oxidation catalysts and Co-based catalysts exhibited better catalytic activity.² Kim et al. investigated a mixture of $\mathbf { L a } _ { 0 . 9 ^ { - } }$ $\mathbf { S r } _ { 0 . 1 } \mathbf { M O } _ { 3 }$ 一 $[ \mathbf { M } = \mathbf { M } \mathbf { n }$ ，Co)and $\mathbf { P d } \mathbf { - R h } / \mathbf { B a O } / \mathbf { C e O } _ { 2 } \mathbf { - Z r O } _ { 2 }$ to rival a commercial Pt-containing LNT catalyst,it was noteworthy that $\mathbf { L a _ { 0 . 9 } S r _ { 0 . 1 } M O _ { 3 } }$ 1 $\mathbf { \dot { M } } = \mathbf { M } \mathbf { n }$ ,Co) showed much higherNO oxidation activity than Pt-based catalysts.1² Thusitis significant to study the perovskite-based catalysts because they are much less expensive and more active towards NO oxidation than Pt-based catalysts.

Bahas been reported to be beneficial for the adsorption of NOx as nitrate.19,20 Moreover,Liang et al. evaluated that Ba doped La-Ba-Ni mixed oxide catalysts for total oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons.21 Compared with Ba free catalyst, Ba doping promoted the catalytic activity and $\mathrm { L a } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { B a } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i O } _ { 3 }$ exhibited the best performance.Bhavani et al. studied $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ reforming of methane by using Ba substituted $\mathbf { L a M n O } _ { 3 }$ perovskiteand found that the optimal level ofBa substitution was 0.1 and 0.15 $\mathbf { \left( B a / M n \right) }$ ，which showed the highest $\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ conversion,syngas selectivity and robust maintenance of these performances with little coke formation.2² These investigations implied that the introduction of Ba into the perovskite structure might promote the catalytic performance.Co-based perovskite oxides were the most promising candidates as NO oxidation catalysts for its superior performance and the application of Ba doped $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ in NO oxidation for emission control has not been studied.Hence in the present study,Ba-doped $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ catalysts with different substitution levels forNO oxidation were investigated.It was found that Ba introduction improved the activity for NO oxidation dramatically and the maximum NO conversion was $9 3 \%$ at $2 6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $\mathrm { L a _ { 0 . 9 } B a _ { 0 . 1 } C o O _ { 3 } }$ ，which exhibited much better performance than Pt-based catalysts (the maximum conversion $6 2 \%$ at $3 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ).Ourresults indicated that Ba doped $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ could be a candidate material as low cost and high performance for NO oxidation catalyst.

# 2.Experimental section

# 2.1 Catalyst synthesis

The Ba doped $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ perovskite oxides were synthesized by a modified sol-gel method using citric acid (CA) and ethylenedi amine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as complexing agents,with an aqueous solution of each nitrate precursor (La,Ba, Co, Sr).The obtained gel was dried at $1 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight and calcined at ${ 7 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ for 5 hours in air prior to calcinations at $5 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 2hours. $2 \%$ $\mathbf { P t } / \mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ was also prepared via the wetimpregnation method as a reference.

In this paper，perovskite-type oxides with the formula $\operatorname { L a } _ { 1 - x } \mathrm { B a } _ { x } \mathrm { C o O } _ { 3 } \left( x = 0 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 3 \right)$ are hereafternamedasLBC10 $\times x$ For example, $\mathrm { L a _ { 0 . 9 } B a _ { 0 . 1 } C o O _ { 3 } }$ is abbreviated as LBC1.

# 2.2 Characterizations

X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to determine the phase structure of the synthesized catalysts,using a Bruker D8 Advance with a copper anode $\mathrm { ' K } \alpha \mathrm { C u } = 1 . 5 4 0 5 6 \mathring \mathrm { A } \mathrm { ^ { \circ } }$ ,operated an accelerating voltage of $4 0 \ \mathrm { k V }$ and intensity of $4 0 ~ \mathrm { { m A } }$ at a step of $0 . 0 2 ^ { \circ } \ \mathbf { s } ^ { - 1 }$ in the Bragg angle (20) range from $1 0 ^ { \circ }$ to $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ ：

The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AEs) was conducted to measure the elementary chemical composition using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2100.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas were determined via nitrogen absorption at $7 7 ~ \mathrm { K }$ using Micro meritics ASAP 202oM physisorption analyzer.Prior to the measurements,the catalysts were degassed at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 5 hours.

The infrared spectra (FT-IR) of the oxides were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer in the range of $3 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ with a resolution of $4 ~ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ averaging 32 scans.

Transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and highresolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM) images were analyzed with a JEM 21oo microscope operated at $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { k V } .$

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPs) measurements were characterized on AXIS ULTRADLD multifunctional X-ray photoelectron spectroscope with an Al $\kappa \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { a } }$ radiation source at room temperature and the base pressure was ${ { 1 0 } ^ { - 7 } }$ Pa $\left( 1 0 ^ { - 9 } \right.$ Torr).

$\mathbf { H } _ { 2 }$ temperature-programmed reduction $\left( \mathbf { H } _ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathbf { T P R } \right)$ of the catalysts were carried outinastream of $1 0 \%$ $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 }$ -Armixtureata flow rate of $5 0 \mathrm { \ m L } \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ using FINESORB3010E instrument (Zhejiang Finetec Co.). For each $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathbf { \mathrm { T P R } }$ test, $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of the catalysts placed ina U-type quartz tube reactor was pretreated at $3 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for 1 hour under $2 1 \%$ （204 $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 } / \mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ stream and then cooled down to room temperature.During the $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 } { \cdot } \mathbf { \mathrm { T P R } }$ process,the sample was heated by increasing the temperature at a rate of $5 ~ \mathrm { { ^ { \circ } C } ~ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ . The $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 }$ concentration in the effluent gas was determined by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with Ar gas as the reference gas.

For temperature-programmed desorption of NO (NO-TPD) experiment, $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ catalyst was pretreated in $1 0 \%$ （20 $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 } / \mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ at $5 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for1 hour and then cooled down to room temperature. And then the gas flow was switched to $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { p p m ~ N O }$ with ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ as the balance after purging with ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ for 30 minutes.Subsequently ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ was introduced after the adsorption was finished.The catalyst was then heated up to $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ at arate of $1 0 \ ^ { \circ } { \bf C } \ \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ with pure $2 0 0 \mathrm { \ m L } \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { \ N } _ { 2 }$ 、ECO physics chemiluminescent NOx analyzer (CLD822Mh),which can detect NO and $\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 }$ and the detect limit is $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { p p m }$ ，was used to detect the desorption species.

# 2.3Activity test

Catalytic evaluation for NO oxidation was carried out in lean conditions by using the same reactor with temperature pro grammed experiment with $3 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ internal diameter of the reactor tube. $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ catalyst was used for each test,with the temperature measured bya K-type thermocouple in direct with the upper quartz wool near the powder. The gas mixture of 400 ppm NO, $1 0 \% \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ and ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ as the balance gas $( 1 5 0 \mathrm { m L } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 } \cdot$ passed through the loaded catalyst. The space velocity was around $1 8 0 \ 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { m L \ g ^ { - 1 } \ h ^ { - 1 } }$ . The furnace was ramped at $2 { \bf \nabla } ^ { \circ } { \bf C }$ $\operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ from room temperature to $4 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } .$ ，The NO conversion was defined as the following formula:

$$
\mathrm { N O ~ c o n v e r s i o n ( \% ) } ~ = \frac { \mathrm { N O _ { i n } - N O _ { o u t } } } { \mathrm { N O _ { i n } } } \times 1 0 0 \
$$

here, $\mathrm { { N O } _ { \mathrm { { i n } } } }$ is the NO concentration in the inlet gas and $\mathrm { { N O } _ { \mathrm { { o u t } } } }$ is the NO concentration in the outlet gas.

# 3. Results and discussions

# 3.1 Structural characterizations

XRD patterns of the obtained LBC catalysts were shown in Fig. 1. $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ behaved the typical hexagonal perovskite structure (JCPDS 25-1060).Note that the main peaks (110) around $2 \theta$ $= 3 3 ^ { \circ }$ were split into two sub-peaks,indicating the rhombohedral distortion of the perovskite structure.For Ba-doped catalysts,the two sub-peaks of main peak (110) were combined into one and shifted to lower $2 \theta$ angles.These demonstrated that Ba had been doped into the lattice structure and improved thesymmetry of the perovskite structure.Similarphenomenon was also observed by Ca and Sr doped $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ elsewhere.14,23 The shift of main peak to lower $2 \theta$ angles suggested the lattice volume expansion as a result of larger ion radius of $\mathbf { B a } ^ { 2 + } \left( 1 . 3 5 \mathring { \mathbf { A } } \right)$ than that of ${ \mathrm { L a } } ^ { 3 + }$ (1.06 A),which was in agreement with the results of Bhavani et al.²² Meanwhile, the corresponding lattice parameters shown in Table 1,which were calculated according to the results of XRD, increased with increasing the doping content of Ba.Additionally,only the perovskite structure was observed in $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ and a very weak diffraction peak of $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ was detected inLBC1.However,the difraction peaks of $\mathbf { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ (JCPDS 70-0363) and $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ (JCPDS 05-0378) were also observed forLBC2 and LBC3,implying some degree of phase segregation. The detailed phase composition on the basis of XRD patterns was shown in Table 2 as well.With increasing the addition of Ba,the content of $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ increased and the phase content of perovskite oxides including LBC and $\mathbf { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ decreased.The ICP measurements displayed in Table 3 demonstrated that the intended compositions were nearly obtained.

Fig.1 XRD patterns of the LBC oxides.

BET specific area of the as-synthesized catalysts was also shown in Table 1. The BET surface area for LBCO was $5 . 1 6 \mathrm { ~ m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,with those of Ba doped catalysts lied between 7.48 and $9 . 8 1 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ .This demonstrated that the introduction of Ba into the perovskite structure improved the BET surface area of the catalysts.

Fig. 2 displayed the FT-IR results of the as-prepared $\mathrm { L a } _ { 1 - x ^ { - } }$ $\mathbf { B a } _ { x } \mathbf { C o O } _ { 3 }$ perovskite oxides.For $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ ,the spectrum bands at $5 9 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (very strong), $5 5 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (shoulder), $4 2 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (strong) and $3 4 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (strong) were observed. These bands were in consistent with the vibrational frequencies that corresponded to three normal modes reported by Merino et al.,3 where the doublet bands at $5 9 8 { - } 5 5 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ to the v1 mode, the band at $4 2 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ to the v2 mode and the band at $3 2 9 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ to the v4 mode.With the introduction of Ba into the A-site,the v1 mode with a shoulder became broader and weaker.Especially for LBC3 with the maximum Ba content the v1 mode became one band compared withBa free sample $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ .Moreover,the intensity of v2 and v4 mode decreased when the Ba doping increased. The v4 mode band at $3 2 9 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was the $_ { \mathbf { O - C o - O } }$ angel deformation,whichwasusuallyinactiveinIRforacubic structure,butitwasactive ina distorted structure.The vibration of v1,v2 and v4 spectrum suggested that the substitution of

La by Ba was in favor of improving the symmetry of the perovskite structure by transforming some amounts of ${ \bf C o } ^ { 3 + }$ into ${ \bf C o } ^ { 4 + }$ .23 The interaction of ${ \bf C o } ^ { 4 + }$ and O is stronger than that of ${ \bf C o } ^ { 3 + }$ and O,thus the peak of the stretching vibration of $\mathrm { C o } ^ { 4 ^ { + } - } \mathrm { O }$ shifted to higher wavenumbers.24 Thus the decrease intensity of Ba-doped samples showed that the substitution of Ba by La favored in improving the symmetry of the perovskite structure.23 For LBC1,the bands at $8 5 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (weak),and $1 4 3 2 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (strong) were detected.These bands were corresponded to the out-ofplane bending and the v3 mode of the carbonates,25,26 respectively,which could come from the incomplete combustion of CA and EDTA.Except these，two new bands at $6 6 8 ~ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ and $6 9 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ were observed on LBC2 and LBC3 as well. One band at $6 6 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was assigned to $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ (the $\mathbf { A B O } _ { 3 }$ vibrations,where A denotes the ${ \bf C o } ^ { 2 + }$ in a tetrahedral position).24 This indicated that $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ was generated when Ba doping content reached $2 0 \%$ Another band at $6 9 3 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ was attributed to in-plane bending mode of CO32-.25,26

TEMand HRTEM images of LBC0 and LBC3 were displayed in Fig.3.The particle sizes of the as-prepared catalysts lied between $4 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and $6 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ .From HRTEM images of LBCO (Fig.3c),the displayed lattice spacing of $0 . 3 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ was corresponded to the (110) crystallite orientations of $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ For LBC3 (Fig.3d),other two crystal planes with the lattice spacing of $0 . 3 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ and $0 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ were also observed,which were corresponded to the (311) and(1o1) crystallite orientations of and $\mathbf { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ ，respectively.This confirmed that $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ were existed on the LBC3 coincided with the results of FTIR.The failure to observe the $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ phase from XRD could be ascribed to its small amount.

# 3.2 XPS

The surface compositions of the catalysts obtained from XPS analysis were listed in Table 4.The reactivity of perovskite was contributed to the active transition B ions reported by Voo rhoeve et al.,27,28 thus the surface content of B ions could be considered as an index correlating to the catalytic activity. As shown in Table 4,the surface Co contentinLBCo was $1 1 . 6 0 \mathrm { a t \% }$ and the higher values were obtained for LBC1,LBC2 and LBC3, which were 17.85，20.72，and $2 1 . 9 5 ~ \mathrm { a t \% }$ ，respectively.This indicated that Ba substitution significantly increased the surface content of Co,indicating the surface segregation of Co.

The content of Co on the surface was improved $5 3 . 8 \%$ with $1 0 \%$ Ba doping.This implied that Ba doping increased Co content on the surface，which could provide more active sites on the surface of the catalysts.With furtherincrease of Ba content, the surface Co contentwas continued to increase.The extra amount of Co and Ba were in the form of $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ ， $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathbf { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ existed on the surface and/or bulk of the catalysts.

# 3.3 $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 }$ TPR

The results of ${ \bf H } _ { 2 } { \bf - T } { \bf P } { \bf R }$ were shown in Fig.4,in which the reductions of $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 } \left( 3 5 8 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \right)$ and $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ $\left( 8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \right)$ were also given asthe references.For LBCo，three reduction peaks were observed at $3 3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ = $3 7 8 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $5 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ respectively.The former two peaks were attributed to the reduction of ${ \bf C o } ^ { 3 + }$ to ${ \mathrm { C o } } ^ { 2 + }$ ,while the last peak at $5 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was ascribed to the reduction of ${ \bf C o } ^ { 2 + }$ to ${ \bf C o } ^ { 0 }$ in the perovskite structure of $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ .29 For all Ba-doped samples,the reduction peaks shifted to lower temperatures. Three reduction peaks of LBC1 shifted to $2 8 3 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . $3 2 4 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ and $4 9 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，respectively,and much lower reduction temperatures were observed on LBC2 and LBC3.This might be attributed to the surface segregation of Co because of Ba substitution,which could facilitate the reduction with $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 }$ .Especially, the reduction temperatures of ${ \bf C o } ^ { 3 + }$ and ${ \mathrm { C o } } ^ { 2 + }$ gradually approached to the reduction temperatures of $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ $( 3 5 8 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ with increasing the amount of Ba doping，underlying that the severe surface segregation of Co favored the formation of $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ observed in HRTEM image (Fig.3d) and FTIR (Fig.2).Meanwhile,after Ba substitution, the starting reduction temperature began around $2 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ,which was muchlower than that of $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ $\left( 2 9 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \right)$

For each Ba-doped sample,additionally,anther reduction peak above $7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was observed.With increasing the amount of Ba,this peak was intensified and shifted to higher temperature approaching the reduction temperature of $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ $\left( 8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } \right)$ . This coincided in observation of $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ phase from XRD results of LBC2 and LBC3 (Fig. 1).

# 3.4 NO-TPD

The NO-TPD experiments were conducted to investigate the NO adsorption/desorption behavior over the $\mathbf { L a } _ { 1 - x } \mathbf { B a } _ { x } \mathbf { C o O } _ { 3 }$ catalysts.For LBCo,two desorption peaks,one below $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and another at higher temperatures,were observed in Fig.5.Wen et al. demonstrated that three species were existed on $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ including bridging nitrates,hyponitrite species and monodentate nitrates.The former two species disappeared up to $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，which might be responsible to the desorption peak below $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in Fig.5,while the most stable monodentate nitrate to the desorption peak at higher temperatures.

For all Ba doped catalysts,the intensities of the two desorption peaks were both greatly became significant,indicating their higher capacities for NO adsorption.As listed in Table 5,the amount of NO desorption over Ba doped samples are above $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu m o l ~ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } }$ ，much larger than that over LBCO 中 $3 5 . 3 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } \ \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } ,$ .Furthermore,the desorption temperatures of Ba-doped samples were also higher shown in Fig. 5,implying higher stabilities of adsorbed species.The Ba-doped samples for higher NO adsorption capacity might be ascribed to the stronger basicity of Ba.

As a reference,the desorption behaviour of NO on $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ was also carried out.From Fig.5,NO desorption was also observed for $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ (peak temperature at $4 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } )$ and $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ (peak temperature at $1 8 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $3 3 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ )whichindicated that both of them would absorb NO.This would explain that the desorption peak of Ba-doped catalysts became broader due to the formation of $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ ， $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathbf { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ on the surface of the catalysts.

# 3.5Activity evaluation

The catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts towards NO oxidation was shown in Fig.6,in which the thermodynamic equilibrium of NO to $\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 }$ was also given as a reference curve. The equilibrium conversion decreased with increasing the reaction temperature because the NO oxidation isan exothermic and reversible reaction.For $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ ,NO conversion began to increase at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ ,and the maximum NO conversion of $7 7 \%$ was reached in the range of $3 1 0 { - } 3 2 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .After that,the conversion dropped down because of thermodynamic limitations.For all Ba-doped samples,introduction of Ba into the perovskite structure promoted NO conversion dramatically,in which the light-off temperatures of NO conversion were shifted to ca. $1 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and the maximums of NO conversion were greatly promoted at lower temperatures.Among these catalysts,LBC1 obtained the best performance with the maximum NO conversion of $9 3 \%$ at $2 6 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Further increase of Ba doping amount, the reactivity decreased slightly.However,it was still much higher than that of $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ . It is worth mentioning that all Badoped samples even behaved much higher activity than $2 \% \mathrm { P t } / \$ $\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ ,and thus could be used as the potential substitutes for the noble metals-based catalysts.For pilot study,the activity of $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathbf { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ were also given in Fig.6,and the reactivity of different Co oxides towards NO oxidation followed the sequence: $\mathrm { L a C o O } _ { 3 } > \mathrm { C o } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 } > \mathrm { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ ，Note that with increasing Ba doping content,the content of the perovskite oxide LBC decreased (Table 2) and the content of Co on the surface of the catalysts increased (Table 4)，but almost similar catalytic performance of LBC1,LBC2 and LBC3 was obtained.This might indicate that some composited interfaces such as $\mathbf { L B C } / \mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ were existed on the surface of the catalysts and the interaction between the perovskite oxides and $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ had a greater contribution on the performance compared with pure LBC catalyst.

# 4. Conclusions

Ba-doped $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ were prepared readily by a modified sol-gel method. XRD, FTIR and ${ \bf H } _ { 2 } { \bf - T } { \bf P } { \bf R }$ indicated that some segregation phases like $\mathbf { B a C O } _ { 3 }$ ， $\mathbf { C o } _ { 3 } \mathbf { O } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathbf { B a C o O } _ { 3 }$ were produced with increasing Ba doping content.Ba substitution for La in $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ perovskite greatly improved the activity for NO oxidation.The best performance with the maximum NO conversion of $9 3 \%$ at $2 6 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ was observed on $\mathrm { L a _ { 0 . 9 } B a _ { 0 . 1 } C o O _ { 3 } }$ .XPS demonstrated that Ba substitution led to the surface segregation of Co,which could promote the activity for NO oxidation.Moreover,all Badoped $\mathbf { L a C o O } _ { 3 }$ had better NO oxidation performance than that of the classical $\mathbf { P t / A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } }$ catalysts.This gave a hint that this kind of materials could be considered as the potential substituting candidate for noble metal-based catalysts and provided a viable direction for finding materials in good NO$\mathbf { N O } _ { 2 }$ conversion with low cost.
