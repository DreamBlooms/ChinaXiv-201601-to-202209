that are crucial for tumor growth and maintenance,can arrest tumor progression and induce a striking regression in molecularly defined subsets of patients.Trastuzumab,a humanized mAb to Her2/neu,improves overall survival when given in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic disease and reduces the risk for disease recurrence and death when given in the adjuvant setting,making the drug the foundation of systemic therapy for Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors(1-3).However,a significant number of patients fail to respond to initial trastuzumab treatment, and many trastuzumab-responsive tumors develop refractory disease within1y of treatment (4-6).Given the increased recognition of de novo and acquired resistance to therapy,considerable research has been dedicated to understanding the molecular mech

anisms of trastuzumab resistance.Although the investigations focused on tumor cells’intrinsic signaling alterations,and multiple trastuzumab-resistance mechanisms have been identified in preclinical studies,including activation of the downstream PI3K signaling pathway(7),accumulation of a constitutively active form of Her2/neu (8,9),and cross-talk ofHer2/neu with other growth factor receptors(1O,11),recent findings uncovered novel roles for the tumor microenvironment (extrinsic mechanism） in modulating therapeutic response and resistance.

In addition to blocking oncogenic signaling and inducing FcRmediated cytotoxicity(12),recent studies byus (13,14) and other investigators (15) showed that anti-Her2/neu Ab-mediated tumor regression also depends on adaptive immunity extrinsic to the tumor cell.Data based on immune signatures of clinical samples established that a strong immune cell component is predictive of a good response to chemotherapy,and a high T lymphocyte infiltration is associated with a higher response rate to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer(16).In contrast,more established tumor was shown to be more immunosuppressive,contributing to further impairment of the antitumor T cell response and tumor progression.There is growing knowledge that the tumor microenvironment contributes to chemotherapy resistance.Gene-expression analyses suggested that tumor stroma gene signature could be predictive for the resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy(17). Tumor-associated macrophages(TAMs） are an important component of the tumor stroma.Experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that TAMs contribute to chemoresistance and radioprotective effects.Clinical evidence showed that an elevated number of TAMs and their distinct profile correlated with therapy failure and poor prognosis in cancer patients(18,19).A recent studyshowed thatbreast tumors with high TAMnumbers andlow numbers of cytotoxic T cells responded relatively poorly to chemotherapy given before surgery; blockade of macrophage recruitment into tumor,in combination with paclitaxel, improved survival of mammary tumor-bearing mice by $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cell-dependent mechanisms (20).

Macrophages are highly plastic and can rapidly change their phenotypes in response to their local signals.Exposure to bacterial products and Th1 cytokines (e.g.,LPS and $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ ）drivesmacrophages toward a classic (M1) activation state characterized by proinflammatory activity, tumoricidal function,and the promotion of T cell responses (21,22).In response to Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13,macrophages undergo alternative (M2) activation,with the ability to support tumor growth,inhibit antitumor immunity,and promote tissue repair. In malignant tumors (21,23),TAMs resemble M2-type macrophages and are considered a promising target for tumor therapy (24).Studiesof TAM-targeted therapies are primarily done by inhibiting macrophage recruitment,survival,and tumor-promoting activity in tumor,but the most potent antitumor strategy should be skewing tumor-promoting M2 TAMs to tumor-suppressive M1-type macrophages (25,26).

In this study,we identify the abundant M2 TAMs in Her2/neu+ breast tumor as a barrier to anti-Her2/neu Ab therapy.Tumor local delivery of IL-21 can skew TAM polarization from the M2 to the M1 phenotype,which reverses immunosuppression and invokes the active antitumor potential that bridges innate and T cell responses for tumor regression.Therefore,our study points to a new strategy to treat established tumor with abundant and unmanageable suppressive macrophages.

# Materials and Methods Mice

BALB/c and C57BL/6 female mice (6-8 wk)were purchased from Vitalriver Experimental Animal (Beijing，China)．BALB/c Rag-1 and FVB/N-transgenic (MMTV-neu) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Institute of Biophysics.The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Biophysics, and all experiments conformed to the relevant regulatory standards.

# Cell lines and reagents

TUBO,cloned from a spontaneous mammary tumor in a BALB/c Neutransgenic mouse (27),was a gift from Joseph Lustgarten (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale,AZ).It was cultured in $5 \%$ （204号 $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and maintained in DMEM supplemented with $10 \%$ heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone),2 mmol/l L-glutamine,O.1 mmol/l MEM nonessential amino acids, $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m l }$ penicillin, and $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ streptomycin.

3T3/Kb and 3T3/NKb cells were provided byDr.Wei-Zen Wei(Wayne StateUniversity,Detroit,MI) (28).3T3/Kb cells expressing the MHC-I molecule $\mathrm { H } 2 \mathrm { - } \dot { \mathrm { K } ^ { \mathrm { d } } }$ and B7.1 were maintained in supplemented DMEM(as above)with the addition of $6 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ G418 and $6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m l }$ Zeocin (both from Invitrogen).3T3/NKb cells expressing $\mathrm { H } 2 { - } \mathrm { K } ^ { \mathrm { d } }$ ,B7.1,and neu $\mathbf { A } \mathbf { g }$ were maintained in supplemented DMEM with $7 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l }$ puromycin (Invitrogen） and $6 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ G418.

Anti-neu Ab 7.16.4,produced in-house (ATCC HB-10493),recognizes the juxtamembranal region of rat neu and competes with 4D5,the precur sor of trastuzumab,for binding and inhibition of tumor growth (29). Recombinant murine IL-21 (endotoxin level $< 1 ~ \mathrm { E U / \mu g } )$ ）was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill,NJ).Murine IL-21/hFc was expressed by transient transfection of the 293E cell line with the corresponding expression plasmid and purified by protein G column (GE).Endotoxinwas measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay(Cambrex,Walkersville, MD).For all Abs and fusion protein preparations,the amount of endotoxin was determined to be ${ < } 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { E U / m g }$ mAb (limit of detection).

# In vivo treatments

TUBO cells $( 6 { - } 1 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } )$ were injected s.c.in the back of 6-8-wk-old mice. Tumor volumes were measured along three orthogonal axes (a,b,and c) and calculated as tumor volume $= \operatorname { a b c } / 2$ .For combination therapy of antiHer2/neu Ab and IL-21, $1 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ anti-Her2/neu Ab was injected i.p.and $5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } }$ IL-21 was injected intratumorally (i.t.)at the indicated time points.

Macrophage depletion was achieved by i.p. $( 1 2 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } )$ ori.t. $( 6 . 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } )$ （2 injection of liposome suspension at the indicated time points by repeated injections every3or $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 4 d }$ .Liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol,with added dichloromethylene diphosphonate (clodronate; courtesy of Roche Diagnostics),were produced as described (3O).The efficiency of macrophage depletion was assessed by CD11b and F4/8O staining.

NK cells were depleted by i.p.injection of $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ anti-asialo GM1(Wako Pure Chemical Industries) 5 d before IL-21 treatment.Cell-depletion effcacy was monitored by staining peripheral blood and tumor mass for DX5.

# Flow cytometry analysis and sorting

Tumor tissues were minced and digested in DMEM with $0 . 1 \%$ collagenase type I for $1 5 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，washed,and passed through a $4 0 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ cell strainer.After centrifuging,cells were blocked with anti-FcR $( 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l } )$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and incubated with the indicated Abs for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .Forflow cytometry analysis,cells were acquired on a FACSCalibur(BD Biosciences),and data were analyzed with FlowJo software.For cell sorting, a FACSAria II(BD Biosciences) was used.TAMs were sorted as $\mathrm { C D 4 5 ^ { + } }$ $\mathrm { C D 1 1 b ^ { + } G r 1 ^ { - } L y 6 C ^ { - } F 4 / 8 0 ^ { + } C D 1 1 c ^ { + } }$ cells.Spleen was digested and stained with CD11b and F4/80 Abs. $\mathrm { C D } 1 1 \boldsymbol { \mathbf { b } } ^ { + } \mathrm { F } \boldsymbol { 4 } / \bar { 8 } 0 ^ { + }$ spleen macrophages were sorted as a control for TAMs.Granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells(G-MDSCs） and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) were gated as $\mathrm { C D 4 5 ^ { + } C D 1 1 \bar { b } ^ { + } G r 1 ^ { + } L y 6 C ^ { - } }$ and $\mathrm { \bar { C D } 4 5 ^ { + } C D 1 1 6 ^ { + } }$ $\mathrm { G r 1 ^ { l o w } L y 6 C ^ { + } }$ ,respectively.

# Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen sections $( 7 ~ \mu \mathrm { m } )$ of treated tumors using mAb against CD8 (clone 53-6.7),F4/80 (clone BM8),CD86 (clone P03.1),and MHC class II (clone M5/114.15.2;all from eBioscience).Briefly,sections were incubated with primarymAb(1/2OO) at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight.After washing，sections were incubated with secondary Ab (anti-rat-HRP) for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ and positive signals were detected using DAB (both from ZSGB-BIO).Three microscope fields for each sample $( n = 6 )$ 1 were selected,and integral OD of positive cells was assessed using ImagePro Plus 6.O software.

# Gene-expression analysis

All mRNA analyses were performed using quantitative real-time PCR $( \mathrm { { q P C R } ) }$ .Briefly,total RNA of cultured cells or sorted cells was extracted by anRNeasy Kit (QIAGEN),following the manufacturer's instructions.FirststrandcDNA was synthesized(NEB)and subjected to qPCR(Bio-Rad CFX96) with SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix(TransGen)using the corresponding primers.Gene expression was normalized to $\beta$ -actin or $I \delta s$ RNA using the △△Ct method.

# Proliferation assay

Lymph node cells were prepared from BALB/c mice,labeled with CFSE $( 2 \mu \mathrm { M }$ in PBS)at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ,and washed with complete RPMI 1640 medium. Then, $0 . 5 \mathrm { - } 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ labeled lymphocytes were cultured with isolated TAMs or spleen macrophages at a 3:1 ratio in the presence of anti-CD3 $( 1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l } )$ and anti-CD28 Abs $( 0 . 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m l } )$ in triplicates in a 96-well roundbottom plate.The proliferation of total cells was tested by CFSE dilution using flow cytometry on day 3,and the cell-proliferation rate was calculated.

# Measurement of IFN $\cdot \gamma$ -secreting Tcellsby ELISPOTassay

Splenocytes were added at $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } / \mathrm { w e l l }$ into a 96-well MSIPS45 plate (Millipore),which wasprecoated with rat anti-mouse $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ (U-CyTech). 3T3/NKb or TUBO cells were added as APCs over the spleen cells,and 3T3/Kb or CT26 cells were used as control.The ratio of responder cells to APC was 10:1.

Tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells were enriched from tumor cell suspension by double Percoll density gradients (36 and $6 3 \%$ ).Theenriched cell suspensions were incubated with PE-conjugated $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ mAb (clone 12-

0081;eBioscience),followed by anti-PE mAb coupled to magnetic beads, and sorted using MS MACS columns and the Midi MACS system (both from Miltenyi Biotec) $( > 8 0 \%$ （204号 $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ cells by flow cytometry).A total of $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } – 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells were added the wells of a 96-well MSIPS45 plate precoated with rat anti-mouse $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ ,and cocultured with APCs at 10:1 ratio in RPMI 164O medium with the addition of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { U / m l }$ IL-2 (Sihuan Pharm).TUBO cells were exposed to $\mathrm { 1 0 ~ n g / m l }$ （204号 $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ prior to plating with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes(TILs） to increase the expression of MHC class I.After $3 6 { \scriptstyle - 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ of incubation,cells were removed, and ELISPOTs were developed following the manufacturer's instructions (U-CyTech),counted,and quantified with a CTL-ImmunoSpot S6 Micro Analyzer (Cellular Technology).The results were expressed as the number of cytokine-producing cells.

# Statistical analysis

Statistical significance was calculated bythe Student $t$ test,unless otherwise stated,with $p < 0 . 0 5$ considered statistically significant. Two-way ANOVA was performed to assess the differences in tumor growth between groups. Data are mean $\pm$ SEM of representative experiments,unless stated otherwise.

# Results

# Tumorprogressionis highly correlated with macrophage infiltration

Because the therapeutic effect of anti-Her2/neu Ab treatment depends on adaptive immunity (13-15),we reasoned that the immunosuppressive mechanisms within tumors might contribute to tumor resistance to anti-Her2/neu therapy. To this end,we dynamically analyzed the immune contexture inside the growing tumor of the Her2/neu-dependent cell line TUBO.In the early stage of tumor growth $( < 5 \mathrm { ~ d ~ }$ after tumor inoculation), few $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 ^ { + }$ leukocytes were seen in tumor tissues.By day 9 after tumor inoculation, tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 4 5 ^ { + } }$ cells were obvious,and the number increased rapidly with tumor growth (Fig.1A).More than half of the infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 4 5 ^ { + } }$ cells were ${ \mathrm { C D } } 1 1 { \mathrm { b } } ^ { + }$ myeloid cells, which could be divided into three populations: $\mathrm { L y 6 c ^ { l o w } G r ^ { \mathrm { - 1 } } } ^ { \mathrm { h i g h } }$ GMDSCs, $\mathrm { L y 6 c } ^ { \mathrm { h i g h } } \mathrm { G r } \mathrm { - } 1 ^ { \mathrm { l o w } / - }$ M-MDSCs, and a $\mathrm { L y 6 c ^ { - } G r ^ { - 1 } } ^ { - }$ population. The $\mathrm { L y 6 c ^ { - } G r ^ { - } l ^ { - } }$ population accounted for ${ \sim } 7 0 \%$ of $\mathrm { C D 1 1 6 ^ { + } }$ cells,whereas G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs each accounted for ${ \sim } 1 0 \%$ of $\mathrm { C D 1 1 6 } ^ { + }$ cells.The majority $( > 8 0 \% )$ of $\mathrm { L y 6 c ^ { - } G r ^ { - 1 } } ^ { - }$ $\mathrm { C D 1 1 6 ^ { + } }$ ，which coexpressed F4/80 and CD11c,should be TAMs (Fig.1B),whereas G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs had no expression of F4/8O and CD11c(data not shown).The data suggest that the number of TAMs increased more dramatically with tumor growth compared with other tumor-infiltrating leukocytes.

The percentage of TAMs in tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 4 5 ^ { + } }$ cells also increased after tumor inoculation(19.9,28.6,and $4 7 . 8 \%$ at days 9, 12,and15,respectively).Theabsolute numberof TAMs increased linearly15-fold between days 9 and15 (Fig.1C).However, tumorinfiltrating T and NK cells increased in the early stage of tumor growth but did not increase further after day 12 (Fig.1D). Correspondingly, the ratio of TAM/CD8 T cell or TAM/NK cell did not change from days 9 to12,but suddenly increasedby 5-fold since day 15 after tumor inoculation (Fig.1E). The number of tumorinfiltrating regulatory T cells did not increase as the tumor grew (data not shown).These results indicate that TAMs are a disproportionately increased subpopulation in TUBO tumor tissue and correlate highly with more established and progressive tumors.

# TAMswith M2 phenotype confer immune tolerance and resistance to anti-Her2/neu therapy

To characterize the TAMs in the ${ \mathrm { H e r } } 2 / { \mathrm { n e u } } ^ { + }$ breast tumor model, TAMs were purified by sorting,and real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression of various functional molecules. Compared with splenic macrophages $( \mathrm { C D 1 1 b ^ { + } F 4 / 8 0 ^ { + } } ,$ ）from tumorbearing or naive mice,TAMs $\mathrm { C D 1 1 6 ^ { + } F 4 / 8 0 ^ { + } } ,$ ）expressed higher levels of the M2-type genes Il10,Tgf $\cdot \beta$ ,and Vegf but lower levels of the M1-type genes Ill2 and $T n f - \alpha$ . The expression of these genes in splenic macrophages was comparable between tumorbearing mice and naive mice.(Fig.2A).In addition, the sorted TAMs dramatically inhibited T cell proliferation stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs,whereas the splenic macrophages from the same tumor-bearing mice had no suppressive effects (Fig.2B).These results show that the macrophages were skewed toward the typical M2 phenotype in the tumor microenvironment, which manifested strong immunosuppressive effects.

To determine whether TAMs contribute to extrinsic resistance to anti-Her2/neu therapy,TUBO-bearingmicewere treatedi.p.with the well-characterized anti-Her2/neu (rat homolog of human Her2) mAb 7.16.4(13),followed by continuous i.t. injection of clodronate liposomes (CELs) to delete TAMs (using vehicle liposome as control).Even for larger tumors in which anti-Her2/neu treatment followed by i.t. injection of vehicle liposome only slightly delayed their growth,TAM deletion following anti-Her2/neu treatment resulted in the regression of all tumors (Fig.2C).The tumors continued to shrink even after the cessation of CEL injections, suggesting that tumor regression is mediated by an antitumor immune response.To assess whether removal of TAMs increased the tumor-specific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cell responses,the sorted tumorinfiltrating $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells or splenocytes were stimulated with 3T3/NKb cells expressing Her2/neu and $\mathrm { H } { - } 2 \mathrm { K } ^ { \mathrm { d } }$ (3T3/Kb as negative control) (28) or TUBO tumor cells(CT26 as negative control) 8 d after completion of CEL injections,and $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ -secreting cells were evaluated by ELISPOT.Both tumor-infltrating $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells and splenocytes from the TAM-deleted group had 3-fold more $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ -producing cells than did those from the vehicle liposome-treated group (Fig.2D),indicating the increased responses of local and systemic tumor-specific T cells.Overall,our data suggest that TAMs confer an immune-suppressive environment that inhibits antitumor T cell responses and results in the emergence of further extrinsic resistance to anti-Her2/neu therapy.

# IntratumoraltreatmentofIL-21dramaticallyincreasesthe therapeuticeffectofanti-Her2/neu Ab

Next,we tried a series of combination treatments to manipulate the immune responses,including anti-CD137 agonist mAb,antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-blocking mAb,and rIL$1 5 / \mathrm { I L } \mathrm { - } 1 5 \mathrm { R } \alpha$ fusion protein to improve the therapeutic efect of anti-Her2/neu Ab.Impressively,i.t.injection of IL-21 resulted in the most notable therapeutic effects combined with anti-Her2/neu treatment. Injection of low-dose IL-21 $( 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } )$ alone had no effect on tumor growth,and anti-Her2/neu treatment alone delayed tumor growth compared with control treatment; however, the combination of these two treatments rapidly eradicated the tumor masses in all mice (Fig.3A).Neu-transgenic mice are tolerant to Rat-neu and are highly resistant to various immunotherapies or antineu Ab. The same therapeutic regimen even rapidly eradicated the established TUBO tumors in all tolerant F1 neu-transgenic mice $\mathrm { \langle B A L B / c \times \ F V B / N }$ MMTV-neu) (Fig.3B). The cured mice rejected the rechallenged tumors,suggesting that long-term immune memory was generated (Fig.3C).However, the i.v.injection of 5- fold more IL-21 had no synergistic antitumor effect with anti-Her2/ neu Ab,suggesting the local effect of IL-21 on tumors (Fig.3D). These results demonstrate that tumor local delivery of IL-21 could overcome the extrinsic resistance of tumors to anti-Her2/neu therapy and markedly improve the antitumor effects of anti-Her2/neu Ab.

# Intratumoral IL-21 directly skews TAMpolarization

Although the antitumor effects of $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { I L } } - 2 1$ are considered to be mediated by NK and/or $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells (31-33), their local effects on tumor tissues in the combination therapy with anti-Her2/neu Ab promoted us to pursue their effects on TAMs.Tumor-bearing

mice were injected i.t.with rIL-21or PBSon days15 and17after tumor inoculation,and the expression of the M1/M2-type genes in TAMs sorted from tumor masses was detected by real-time PCR $3 \mathrm { d }$ after the last injection of IL-21.TAMs from the IL-21-treated group expressed reduced levels of M2-type genes Tgf $\cdot \beta$ ，I10, Ccl17，Vegf,and Arg2 compared with TAMs from the control group.In contrast, the M1-type genes $C x c l 9$ and iNos tended to be upregulated in TAMs from the IL-21-treated group (Fig. 4A). Instead of inhibiting T cell proliferation,TAMs from IL-21- treated tumors enhanced T cell proliferation(Fig.4B).Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that IL-21 treatment significantly increased the expression of CD86 on TAMs,whereas it tended to reduce the tumor infiltration of macrophages and enhance MHC class II expression on TAMs (Supplemental Fig.1).

To test the antitumor effect of IL-21 through TAM polarization in other tumor models,we combined tumor local treatment of IL-21 with the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in an MCA2O5 tumor model. Doxorubicin treatment alone had minimal effect on tumor growth, whereas combination with IL-21 treatment dramatically improved its therapeutic effect (Supplemental Fig.2A). Similarly,i.t. injection of IL-21 significantly decreased the expression of M2-type genes Ccl17,

$T g f { - \beta }$ ,and Vegf in sorted TAMs fromMCA2O5 tumors (Supplemental Fig.2B).These results demonstrate that tumor local treatment of IL21 skewed TAM polarization away from the immune-suppressive M2 phenotype toward the immune-stimulatory M1 phenotype.

TAM polarization induced by intratumoral delivery of IL-21 might be explained by the stimulation of tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells and NK cells to produce $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ ,a strong stimulator of M1 polarization of macrophages. To exclude this possibility, tumor-bearing $\mathrm { R a g } ^ { - / - }$ mice were injected i.p. with anti-asialo GM1 Ab 5 d before the first i.t. injection of IL-21.TAMs from IL-21-treated mice lacking T,B,and NK cells still upregulated the expression of the M1-type gene iNos and downregulated the expression of the M2- type genesIlio, Ccll7,Vegf,and $T g f { - \beta }$ to a greater extent than did TAMs from IL-21-treated wild-type mice (Fig. 4C,compared with Fig.4A). These results suggest that TAM polarization skewed by IL-21 treatment is independent of T,B,or NK cells.

To assess the direct effect of IL-21 on TAM polarization,the freshly sorted TAMs were cultured with IL-21 overnight.They expressed reduced levels of the M2-type genes Vegf and $T g f { - \beta }$ ,but increased levels of the M1-type gene $C c l { 2 }$ ，compared with TAMs from the control group (Fig. 4D).In addition, the in vitro treatment of IL-21 also decreased the expression of the M2-type genes Vegf and IllO in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Supplemental Fig.3A) and Vegf, $T g f { - \beta }$ ,Il10,and Ccll7 in peritoneal macrophages,and it markedly increased the expression of the M1-type genes $T n f - \alpha$ and $I l { \boldsymbol { \theta } }$ in peritoneal macrophages induced by a low dose of LPS (Supplemental Fig.3B); this suggested that the effect of IL-21 on macrophage polarization was not specific to TAMs.These results indicate that IL-21 could directly skew macrophages away from the M2 phenotype.

# IL-21amplifiesthe tumor-specific $C D \delta ^ { + }$ T cell response throughpolarizing TAMs

Our previous study showed that anti-Her2/neu Ab treatment increased tumor infltration of $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T and NK cells (13).Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the combination treatment of IL-21 and anti-Her2/neu Ab further increased tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells by 2-fold,which reached $20 \%$ of tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D } 4 5 ^ { + }$ cells,but failed to increase $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ T cells and NK cells in tumors compared with anti-Her2/neu Ab alone (Fig.5A，5B).Strikingly,the percentage of IFN- $\cdot \gamma$ -producing cells among tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells from the combined treatment group was also 2-fold more than that of the anti-Her2/neu group (Fig.5C).Thus, tumor local delivery ofIL-21 increased the quantity and enhanced the function of $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells in tumors treated with anti-Her2/neu Ab.

To underscore the role of TAM polarization skewed by IL-21 treatment in our combination therapy，we compared the effects of TAM deletion on therapy with anti-Her2/neu Ab alone and combination therapy.Anti-Her2/neu treatment alone only delayed the tumor growth,whereas TAM deletion following Ab treatment markedly enhanced the therapeutic effects of anti-Her2/neu Ab, which resulted in tumor regression in four of six mice, indicating that TAMs were predominantly of tumor-promoting M2 phenotype in Ab-treated tumors.Conversely,combination therapy of antiHer2/neu and IL-21 resulted in rapid elimination of all detectable tumors,whereas the TAM deletion prevented the tumor regression induced by the combination treatment and caused rapid grow-up of tumors in two of six mice,suggesting that TAMs are tumor-inhibitory M1 phenotype in tumors with the combination treatment (Fig.5D).Concomitant with the contrary polarization of TAMs with anti-Her2/neu Ab alone and combination therapy, TAM deletion increased $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ -producing $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells in tumors treated with anti-Her2/neu Ab alone while dramatically reducing $\mathrm { I F N - } \gamma$ -producing $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells in tumors treated with combination therapy to the same level as that seen with anti-Her2/neu monotherapy(Fig.5E).Collectively, these results show that the combination treatment of IL-21 and anti-Her2/neu Ab can greatly amplify the tumor-specific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cell response in the tumor microenvironment triggered by anti-Her2/neu therapy through reprogramming TAMs from the M2 phenotype to the M1 phenotype.Moreover, the reprogrammed M1 TAMs are required for the tumor regression mediated by the combination therapy of anti-Her2/neu and IL-21.

# Discussion

In this study,we found that TAMs with the M2 phenotype are gradually enriched within growing tumors and confer tumor resistance to anti-Her2/neu therapy as a major extrinsic limitation. Next,we demonstrated an effective strategy to prevent anti-Her2/ neu-resistant breast cancer: combination therapy using anti-Her2/ neu Ab and tumor local IL-21.The mechanism underlying its superior effect is that IL-21 has the potential to skew TAMs away from the immune-suppressive M2 phenotype and,therefore,break the immune tolerance of the tumor microenvironment.

Recent work showed convincingly that Ab-mediated tumor control depends on both innate and adaptive immune responses (13-15).However,multiple immune-suppressive mechanisms in the cancer microenvironment impair antitumor immunity and promote tumor recurrence. Targeting intrinsic signaling of tumor cells,as well as the extrinsic immune-suppressive microenvironment,will enhance the ongoing immune response against tumor, resulting in sustained tumor remission (34,35).One of the most successful strategies is blockade of the B7-H1(PD-L1)/PD-1 pathway.Recent clinical trials demonstrated that ${ \sim } 4 0 \%$ of patients treated with human anti-PD1 Ab had objective responses,with a durable response observed in only $20 \%$ of patients (36).Although this is an exciting strategy because this treatment has a much higher success rate than conventional treatment, the majority of patients still fail to respond to anti-PDl treatment. Other strategies need to be considered.

The tumor microenvironment contains various cellular and molecular immune-suppressive mechanisms.Different tumors might rely on different key dominant immune-resistant mechanisms.In this TUBO breast cancer model,PD-1is highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } T }$ cells.Blockade of PD-1 signaling by anti-PD-1 Ab improves the therapeutic activity of anti-Her2/neu therapy (15).However, this therapeutic strategy is not the most optimal combinatorial treatment with regard to anti-Her2/neu Ab, especially for larger or advanced tumors (data not shown); this suggests that,in addition to the PD-1 signaling pathway,other immune-suppressive mechanisms are responsible for resistance to anti-Her2/neu therapy.In this study,we characterized the abundant M2 TAMs in $\mathrm { H E R 2 / n e u ^ { + } }$ breast tumor as a dominant extrinsic limitation to confer tumor resistance to anti-Her2/neu Ab therapy. This is consistent with a recent clinical study demonstrating that stromal infiltration of $\mathrm { C D 6 8 ^ { + } }$ macrophages correlated inversely with the presence of $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells in human breast cancer tissues and that the CD68/CD8 immune signature is an independent prognostic indicator for survival (2O,37).Thus,a similar phenotype of TAMs might exist and mediate resistance to anticancer therapy in human breast cancer. TAMs are recognized as a promising target for tumor therapy,and reduction of their tumorpromoting activities has become a hot topic.TAM-targeted antitumor approaches principally include inhibition of macrophage recruitment and survival in tumor and blockade of the tumorpromoting activity of TAMs.Macrophages are highly plastic and canadopta different phenotype depending on the changingmilieu. TAMs can be re-educated to become tumoricidal or tumor-suppressive M1-like phenotype.Nonetheless,only a few molecules have been identified to orchestrate this process (25,38,39).

IL-21,a pleiotropic common $\gamma$ -chain(yc）cytokine,is primarily produced by activated $\mathrm { C D 4 ^ { + } }$ T cells and NKT cells,but it acts on multiple lineages,including T cells,B cells,NK cells,NKT cells, and dendritic cells.It should be noted that the role of IL-21 is well established in Tand B cells,but it is less well studied in innate immunity (4O,41).Although several studies demonstrated the complex effects of IL-21 on dendritic cells (42,43),its role in other myeloid cells is poorly documented.It was reported that monocytes/macrophages express IL-21R,and stimulation of IL-21 in vitro enhances phagocytosis and protease activity of monocytes/ macrophages (44-47). Our present study reveals an unprecedented role for IL-21 in re-educating TAMs.We found that tumor local delivery of IL-21 can shift TAM polarization from the immunesuppressive M2 phenotype to the tumor-inhibiting M1 phenotype, which dramatically promotes anti-Her2/neu Ab therapy. The polarization is a direct action of IL-21 on TAMs,but it is not mediated by $\mathrm { I F N - \gamma }$ produced by IL-21-activated $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells and/or NK cells,because in vitro stimulation of IL-21 can rapidly skew the polarization of sorted TAMs;elimination of T,B,and NK cells enhances,instead of diminishes,the tumor local IL-21-induced polarization of TAMs to the M1 phenotype; and depletion of TAMs decreases the progression of anti-Her2/neu-treated tumors while increasing the growth of tumors treated with anti-Her2/neu and IL-21,implying that TAMs acquired a tumor-suppressive M1-like phenotype when exposed to local IL-21. Treatment with IL-21 alone also decreased the expression of the M2-type genes Vegf and IiO in M-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages and Vegf, Tgf-β,Il1o,and Ccll7 in peritoneal macrophages. These results were contrary to the study by Pesce et al.(48),in which pretreatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages with IL-21 increased the expression of the M2-type genes Arg-1 and FIZZl when subsequently stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13. This difference may suggest that macrophage programing by IL-21 depends on the environment of the macrophages.Thus,more research is required to define the effects of IL-21 on macrophages in various conditions.

IL-21 had significant antitumor activity against a variety of tumors in preclinical studies,and it is ina phase II clinical trial for metastatic melanoma (49-52).Depending on the tumor type and the methods of IL-21 application,the antitumor effect of IL-21 was mediated by $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells,NK cells,or both.Most of these studies were done by deleting $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells or NK cells with Abs. However, it is well known that antitumor $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } T }$ cells or/and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment are firmly harnessed by a plethora of immune-suppressive mechanisms,so that they cannot be fully activated if the immune-suppressive mechanisms are not blocked or ameliorated.Therefore,our studies suggest that,in well-established tumors，such as larger or advanced tumors, skewing TAM polarization to the M1-like phenotype is the prerequisite for IL-21 to augment $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cell and/or NK cell cytotoxicity to exert its antitumor effects.Otherwise,IL-21 should not be able to directly activate $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells and NK cells to eliminate the tumors because of the immune-suppressive mechanisms dominatedby TAMs.IL-21-induced polarization of TAMs eliminates the immune suppression of TAMs to unleash the tumorspecific $\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cell response,as well as reverses the immune suppression of TAMs to simulate antitumor immune responses. Based on our data,the potential clinical applicability of IL-2- mediated programming of macrophages allows for a more broad and attractive candidate for combination with Ab,aswell aswith immunogenic chemotherapy,irradiation,and novel immunotherapeutic agents,such as adoptive transfer of TCR-engineered T cells or treatment with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4.Because TAM abundance,distribution，and phenotypes varied between mouse models and human patients,even within different types of human cancers,future work should aim to define the response of TAMs to IL-21 stimulation in different types and subtypes of human cancers.To overcome the shortcoming of local injection of IL-21, fusion of IL-21 with the anti-Her2/neu Ab will be a strategy for tumor-targeting the delivery of IL-21 while maintaining the antitumor effects of the Ab.

In conclusion,our study demonstrates that the M2-type of TAM plays a dominant role in extrinsic resistance to Ab therapy,which isa promising anticancer strategy.We combined Ab therapy with targeteddeliveryofIL-21 to efficiently break the tumorresistance when the M2 type of TAMs become dominant. Our findings unveil a role for IL-21 in reprogramming M2 TAMs and highlight the potential of using re-educated TAMs to restore the antitumor T cell response. The study provides an opportunity to develop nextgeneration biologics by combining anti-Her2/neu Ab with IL-21.
