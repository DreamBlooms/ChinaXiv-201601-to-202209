Adaptations to hypoxia play an important role in Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis. RvO324,which contains an HTH DNA-binding domain and a rhodanese domain,is one of the key transcription regulators in response to hypoxia.M.tuberculosis Rv1674c is a homologue of Rv0324.To understand the interdomain interaction and regulation of the HTH domain and the rhodanese domain，recombinant Rv1674c protein was purified and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to $2 . { \dot { 2 } } 5 { \dot { \mathrm { ~ A ~ } } }$ resolution. Preliminary difraction analysis suggests that the crystals belonged to space group $P 3 _ { 1 } 2 1$ or $P 3 _ { 2 } 2 1$ ，with unit-cell parameters $a \ : = \ : b \ : = \ : 6 7 . 8$ ， $c = 1 7 4 . { \overset { \circ } { . } } { \overset { \circ } { \mathrm { A } } }$ $\alpha ~ = ~ \beta ~ = ~ 9 0$ ， $\gamma ~ = ~ 1 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ ．The Matthews coefficient was calculated to be $2 . 4 4 \mathring { \mathbf { A } } ^ { 3 } \mathbf { D } \mathrm { a } ^ { - 1 }$ , assuming that the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two protein molecules.

# 1.Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a challenging problem that threatens the health of much of the world's population. The detection and thetreatment of TB is complicated because Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can survive within the host for months to decades in an asymptomatic state (Manabe & Bishai, 2000; Flynn& Chan,2Oo1).The mechanism of persistence of MTB is far from clearly understood.

Recently, the MTB regulatory network based on 5O transcription factors has been described and has provided new insight into the physiological consequences of the regulatory programs induced by changes in oxygen availability(Galagan et al.,2O13).Adaptations to hypoxia are thought to play a prominent role in the persistence of MTB.In this network, Rv0324 is an important knot.It is predicted to activate another knot,KstR，which is a cholesterol degradation repressor.RvO324 and KstR are both associated with the enduring hypoxic response (EHR),which is induced later but not in the initial response to hypoxia (Rustad et al.,2008). $\mathtt { R v 0 3 2 4 }$ contains two domains: an N-terminal HTH ArsR-type DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal rhodanese domain. Sequence analysis shows that RvO324 only shares sequence homology with Rv1674c in MTB.Rv0324 and Rv1674c share $45 \%$ sequence identity and thus are deduced to have similar biochemical functions.

The SmtB/ArsR family proteins are transcriptional repressors that sense distinct metal ions and are involved in the regulation of metal detoxification (Busenlehner et al.,2003). Metal binding by these proteins directly negatively regulates binding of the operator/promoter(O/P) region(Wu & Rosen, 1993).The structures of members of this family reveal that the

ArsR type of HTH domain often forms a homodimer to bind double-stranded DNA (Lee et al.,2012).On the other hand, rhodaneses are widely distributed enzymes that catalyse the transferof a sulfane froma sulfur donor suchas thiosulfate to asulfur acceptor such as cyanide (Nandi & Westley,1998). Rhodanese-like proteins alone or in combination with other proteins perform roles in cyanide detoxification,the restoration of iron-sulfur centres in Fe-S proteins, the management of stress tolerance and the maintainance of redox homeostasis (Ogasawara et al.,2001; Sabelli et al.,2008).

Although the three-dimensioned structures of the HTH domain and the rhodanese domain have been intensively studied, no structure of a combination of these two domains within one protein such as in RvO324 and Rv1674c has been reported. The functional mechanism of RvO324/Rv1674c should be related to the interdomain regulation of the HTH and rhodanese domains.In addition,the highest sequence identity of a structurally determined rhodanese to the Rv0324 rhodanese domain is only $3 5 \%$ ．More importantly，the sequences of the predicted active regions of $\mathtt { R v 0 3 2 4 }$ and Rv1674c,with two or three cysteine residues,are not comparable to those of the structurally determined rhodanese, which contains only one catalytic residue.To investigate the structure-functionrelationship ofRvO324/Rvl674c,as well as the interaction or regulation between the HTH domain and rhodanese domain within one protein molecule,we tried to study the crystal structures of Rv0324 and Rv1674c.Unfortunately,attempts to crystallize RvO324 in our laboratory failed.Here,we report the expression,purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of Rvl674c.The structure of Rv1674c should provide useful information to understand the regulatorymechanism ofRv0324.

# 2.1.Macromolecule production

The gene for Rv1674c(UniProt accession No. O53921) was optimized for expression in Escherichia coli and synthesized by GenScript (Nanjing, People's Republic of China). It was then subcloned into the pET-28a-SUMO(Novagen） expression vector with XhoI and BamHI restriction sites.An

N-terminal $\mathrm { H i s } _ { 6 }$ tag and a SUMO tag from the vector were thus fused to Rv1674c (Table 1).

E.coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the recombined plasmid containing Rv1674c. The transformants were cultured in LB medium contaning $2 5 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { m l } ^ { - 1 }$ kanamycin at $3 1 0 \mathrm { K }$ until the $\mathrm { \Gamma _ { O D _ { 6 0 0 } } }$ reached O.6-0.8. IPTG was then added to the culture medium to a final concentration of $0 . 2 { \mathrm m } M$ for the production of protein and the cells were cultured fora further $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ at $3 1 0 \mathrm { K }$ .The cells were harvested by centrifugation at $4 0 0 0 g$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $2 7 7 \mathrm { K }$

For the purification of Rvl674c, the cells were resuspended inlysisbuffer( $5 0 { \mathrm { m } } M$ Tris-HCl $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 5$ ,150 mM NaCl, $1 { \mathrm { m } } M$ PMSF) and lysedby sonication.The lysate was centrifuged at $3 8 9 0 0 g$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ at $2 7 7 \mathrm { K }$ . The supernatant was loaded onto 5 ml Ni-NTA matrix (GE Healthcare). The target protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing $2 0 0 \mathrm { m } M$ imidazole.ULP1 protease was then added to the protein at a mass ratio of 1:20 to remove the SUMO tag.After digestion,the mixture was applied onto Ni-NTA column beads again so that the N-terminal His-SUMO tag remained bound to the beads. The flowthrough containing Rv1674c with no tag was collected and was concentrated by ultrafiltration for gel-filtration chromatography. The protein sample was loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare） equilibrated with buffer consisting of $5 0 \mathrm { m } M$ Tris-HCl pH 7.5, $1 5 0 \ : \mathrm { m } M \ : \mathrm { N a C l }$ at $2 7 7 \mathrm { K }$ .Fractions containing Rv1674c as identified by SDS-PAGE were collected and concentrated for crystallization. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit.

# 2.2.Crystallization

Forinitial crystallization,the concentrationofRv1674cwas adjusted to $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g ~ m l ^ { - 1 } }$ . Crystallization-condition screening was carried out using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at $2 8 9 \mathrm { K }$ with the commercial screening kits Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen2,Indexand PEG/Ion fromHamptonResearch and The Nucleix Suite and The Cryos Suite from Qiagen. $3 0 0 { \mathrm { n l } }$ protein solution was mixed with $3 0 0 { \mathrm { n l } }$ reservoir solutionand equilibrated against $3 5 \mu \mathrm { l }$ reservoir solution in 96-well platesusing a Mosquito robot.Crystals were found in several conditions after a week.To improve the crystal quality,optimization of the crystallization condition was performed using sitting-drop vapour diffusion in 48-well plates and hangingdrop vapour diffusion in 24-well plates with $1 \mu \mathrm { l }$ protein solution and $1 \mu \mathrm { l }$ reservoir solution.Different precipitant concentrations,salt concentrations and $\mathrm { \ p H }$ values were used in the reservoir solutions. Different protein concentrations (3.5 and $5 ~ \mathrm { m g } ~ \mathrm { m l } ^ { - 1 }$ ） were also used for further optimization.

# 2.3. Data collection and processing

Diffraction data were collected on beamline BL17U at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF） using an ADSC Q315 detector at $1 0 0 \mathrm { K }$ .Crystals were loop-mounted and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.A total of 18o diffraction images were collected with an oscillation of $1 ^ { \circ }$ and an exposure time of $0 . 5 \mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ per image. The diffraction data were indexed, integrated and scaled using the HKL-2ooO package (Otwinowski&Minor,1997).

# 3.Results and discussion

Recombinant Rv1674c protein from M.tuberculosis with an N-terminal His-SUMO tag was successfully produced in E.coli cells. Soluble protein was obtained after sonication and was eluted from an Ni-NTA affinity column. The N-terminal His-SUMO tag was cleaved using ULP1 protease and was removed completely after a second Ni-affinity column and gelfiltration purification. A single protein band of approximately $2 6 \mathrm { k D a }$ was observed by SDS-PAGE and the molecular mass is consistent with the calculated mass of full-length $\mathrm { R v 1 6 7 4 c }$ (Fig.1). The purity of the protein was estimated to be at least $9 5 \%$ . According to the elution volumn of Rvl674c and that of the low-molecular-weight protein marker (GE Healthcare) during gel-filtration chromatography,Rv1674c forms a dimer in solution，which is in agreement with other proteins containing an HTH DNA-binding domain.

The crystals found in the initial screening conditions were small and were not well shaped. Reduction of the protein concentration reduced the number of crystal nuclei and

enlarged the crystals. The crystal used for diffraction data collection appeared in an optimized condition consisting of $0 . 0 5 \ : M$ sodium cacodylate $\mathrm { p H } ~ 6 . 5$ ， $0 . 2 M$ KCl, $2 . 5 \% ( w / \nu )$ hexanediol using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method with $3 . 5 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m l } ^ { - 1 }$ protein at $2 8 9 \mathrm { K }$ after a week (Table 2).The crystal shape was hexagonal and the dimensions of the crystal were about $1 1 0 \times 1 1 0 \times 5 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ (Fig.2). The Rv1674c crystal diffracted to $2 . 2 5 \mathring { \mathrm { A } }$ resolution at SSRF. Processing and analysis of the diffraction data indicated that the unit-cell parameters were $a = b = 6 7 . 8$ ， $c = 1 7 4 . 5 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ }$ ， $\alpha = \beta = 9 0$ ， $\gamma = 1 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ and that the crystals belonged to space group $P 3 _ { 1 } 2 1$ or $P 3 _ { 2 } 2 1$ ， which share the same diffraction absence pattern and are not distinguishable at the current stage. The data-processing statistics are listed in Table 3.Calculation of the Matthews coefficient suggested that there would be two Rv1674c molecules in the asymmetric unit,with a Matthews coefficient of $2 . 4 4 \mathring { \mathbf { A } } ^ { 3 } \mathbf { D } \mathrm { a } ^ { - 1 }$ and a solvent content of $5 0 \%$ (Matthews, 1968). Similar structures have been reported for both the HTH DNA-binding domain and the rhodanese domain of $\mathrm { R v 1 6 7 4 c }$ and it is expected that the structure of Rv1674c will be determined by molecular replacement using these similar structures as search models.
