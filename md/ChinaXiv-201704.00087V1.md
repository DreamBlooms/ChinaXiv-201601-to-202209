AbstractThe demand for fiberboards has been growing in recent years.However,emission of formaldehyde,which was the main component of adhesives in fiberboards,has caused environmental and health concerns.Industries are therefore pursuing green chemistry technologies to eliminate these concerns.Binderless fiberboards appeared to be such candidates since the manufacturing process involved no resin addition. Several potential mechanisms of the formation of binderless fiberboards have been proposed. Chemical changes of components in lignocellulosic materials were expected to occur, and self-bonding achieved during hot pressing provided main bonding strength. This review summarized various aspects of binderless fiberboard production，particularly feasibility of different raw materials,chemical and enzymatic pretreatments of raw materials, manufacturing process，as well as the potential mechanism of self-bonding. Furthermore, further work that may benefit the elucidation of self-bonding mechanism was discussed.

# Introduction

The presence of adhesives is traditionally essential for fiberboard manufacture to keep proper physical and mechanical properties.Formaldehyde,one of the most common components in adhesives,has been widely employed in the industry due to its low cost and desirable performance (Saheb and Jog 1999; Sreekala et al. 2000; Zadorecki and Michell 1989). However, the emission of formaldehyde from fiberboards gave rise to environmental and health concerns (Salthammer et al. 2010).Recently, formaldehyde has been reclassified into carcinogenic category 1B according to labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP) regulation in June 2014 in Europe (Regulation 605/2014). In order to eliminate these concerns, formaldehyde-free adhesives made from natural resources， including lignin (Mansouri et al. 2007; Yau et al. 2006), soy protein (Kumar et al. 2002),wheat protein (Schopper and Kharazipour 2006; Nikvash et al. 2012,2013） and starch (Imam et al. 2OO1)，have been extensively researched. However,high cost and relatively poor performance limited their application in the industry (Zhang et al. 2014b). Therefore,the production of fiberboards without adhesives addition is a promising strategy from economic and environmental perspectives. Earlier researches have demonstrated the feasibility of bark as raw materials to produce binderless fiberboards (Chow 1975；Wellons and Krahmer 1973). However, the requirement for high pressing temperature as one of the main obstacles limited their application and development (Chow 1972; Gupta et al. 2011). Recently, binderless fiberboards made from refined bark of black spruce have been obtained.However, fabrication of wood fibers and bark in a sandwich structure was needed to obtain acceptable results (Gao et al.2O11). Systematic researches on binderless fiberboards could be traced back to 198Os.Mobarak et al.(1982） prepared binderless lignocellulose composite from bagasse,and the potential mechanism of selfbonding was discussed.Later on, Shen (1986) proposed and patented a process for the production of binderless fiberboards,which made its industrialization possible. Different raw materials, such as coconuts (Van Dam et al. 2OO4),oil palm (Baskaran et al.2012）and bamboo (Shao et al. 2Oo9),have been studied to determine their feasibility in the production of binderless fiberboards. Chemical and enzymatic pretreatments of raw materials provided new avenues toward the improvement of properties of binderless fiberboards,owing to their ability to form free radicals on the surface of fibers (Felby et al. 1997a,b; Kharazipour et al. 1997;RiquelmeValdes et al. 2008;Widsten 2002; Huttermann et al. 2001; Muller et al. 2009; Mai et al. 2O04; Kies et al. 2OO7). Additionally,manufacturing processes concerning steam explosion before hot pressing and steam injection explosion have been developed and suggested to generate more reactive sites contributing to selfbonding,which in turn improved the performance of binderless fiberboards to meet established industrial standards (Quintana et al. 2Oo9;Widyorini et al. 2005c).

However,discussions or results of the production of binderless fiberboards are most limited on laboratory level. The reason behind this is that the mechanisms of self-bonding formation during the production of binderless fiberboards have remained elusive.Therefore,elucidation of self-bonding mechanism is beneficial for further improvement of performance of binderless fiberboards and thus their industrialization. Several potential explanations have been proposed: lignin-furfural linkages (Suzuki et al. 1998), condensation reaction in lignin (Okuda et al. 2006b) and furfural self-polymerization (Yan et al. 1996).Furthermore,physical phenomenon involving thermal softening of lignin has also been suggested to be partially responsible for fiberboards formation (Bouajila et al. 2Oo5).Actually, the mechanism behind this process varies depending on raw materials and manufacturing process. Moreover, reactions and phenomenon mentioned above are expected to work collaboratively for the production of binderless fiberboards.Large varieties of studies have been conducted to elucidate the self-bonding mechanism by means of several tools,such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR） and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the composition changes of binderless fiberboards (Okuda et al. 2006b; Xu et al. 2Oo6).While these analyses revealed chemical changes in binderless fiberboards before and after pressing，no detailed information on specific or functional group changes during the pressing could be found. Pressing is a dynamic process. Its variables regarding temperature and pressure generally fluctuate as the time changes. Therefore,it is necessary to understand the correlation between changes of groups and fluctuation of variables.Importantly, these works would benefit the optimization of manufacturing process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) seems to serve as such a purpose since it has been used to study the surface chemical compositions of cellulosic fibers before and after esterification (Matuana et al.2OO1).Detailed information will be discussed later.

Summarily, different raw materials were reviewed which have been employed in the production of binderless fiberboards. Chemical and enzymatic pretreatments of raw materials have also been discussed.After a discussion of manufacturing process，self-bonding mechanism of binderless fiberboards as one of the most important aspects was covered.Finally, future work that may deserve attention has been proposed.

# Resources of raw materials

Not all lignocellulosic materials are suitable for the production of binderless fiberboards which is economically attractive for commercialization.Attentions have been put on woody fibers as a raw material since binderless fiberboards were successfully obtained from two different types of fiber furnishes (Suchsland et al. 1985).Furthermore,other resources,such as bagasse,flax and corn，have been patented to make fiberboards without resin addition (Shen 1986). Therefore,the resources were classified into woody and non-woody raw materials. They are described in the following sections.

# Woodyrawmaterials

In most cases, high amounts of cellulose and lignin but low hemicelluloses content were found in woody materials. Consequently,wood-based composites exhibited a better resistance to water than other non-woody materials due to the fact that hemicelluloses are hydrophilic and able to adsorb water(Ye et al. 2OO7). On the other hand, synthetic resins are usually used for the production of wood-based fiberboards because of weak bonding strength which maybe result from the low hemicelluloses content as well. Specifically, residues of spruce and pine have been examined for their potential in producing binderless fiberboards (Anglés et al.2001; Angles et al.1999). Steam explosion pretreatment was applied in order to determine their effect on board properties.It turned out that steam explosion was beneficial for the improvement of physical properties of fiberboards. Other woody materials, such as Pinus radiata (Riquelme-Valdes et al. 2Oo8), spruce fibers (Widsten et al. 2003), beech and rubber fibers (Felby et al.1997a,20O4; Nasir etal.2013),have also been evaluated in the production of binderless fiberboards.However,all woody fibers suffered from enzymatic or chemical pretreatment to generate more stable radicals which were able to initiate self-bonding between fibers.While poplar fibers showed their potential to prepare binderless fiberboards,the addition of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin was conducted to improve the properties of fiberboards (Zhou et al.2O13). Recently，the authors’ group has patented a method to produce binderless fiberboards with high density and thickness and observed that procedure to control the size of cross section and length of wood fibers was essential for their production (Zhang et al. 2O13). In general, binderless fiberboards made from woody raw materials seem to necessarily combine other treatments,such as steam explosion pretreatments and surface activation of fibers. The addition of wax or lignin maybe acts as an alternative option to keep acceptable dimensional stability without compromising bonding strength.

# Non-woodyraw materials

Due to increasing wood price and shortage of wood supply,alternative sources of raw materials for the production of fiberboards are needed.Lignocellulosic wastes including bagasse (Shen 1986;Widyorini et al. 2O05a),coconut husk (Van Dam et al. 2OO4) and wheat straws (Halvarsson et al. 2Oo9) have been explored due to their low price and richness.Velasquez et al.(2Oo3) produced binderless fiberboard fromMiscanthus sinensis,and the obtained fiberboards exhibited desirable performance under optimized conditions after steam explosion pretreatment. The suitability of banana bunch has also been evaluated. Raw materials were steam exploded and then used to make binderless fiberboard (Quintana et al.2009). However, low IB and high thickness swelling(TS） values were observed,and it could probably be related to lignin structure of banana bunch and high residual Xylose content,respectively. Furthermore,it was suggested that the grinding process before the pressing stage was able to significantly improve IB without compromising other physical-mechanical properties of fiberboards from steam-exploded Miscanthus sinensis (Velasquez et al.2OO2).Recently, the potential of seed cake as raw material was investigated for the production of fiberboards,and the mechanical properties are comparable with typical commercial fiberboards under optimized conditions (Hidayat et al.2O14). Obviously, chemical compositions of raw materials determined their suitability in the production of binderless fiberboards. Varieties of non-woody raw materials used in the production of binderless fiberboards are summarized in Table 1. In summary，poor dimensional stability of binderless fiberboards made from non-woody materials was one of the biggest drawbacks resulting from high hemicelluloses content. The extension of steam pretreatment seemed to be an option to overcome this drawback, but correspondingly, the energy consumption has to be considered.

# Pretreatment of raw materials

It was well known that adhesives were able to enhance fiber interaction providing desirable mechanical and physical properties. Therefore, the production of fiberboards without synthetic resin was challenging. Chemical pretreatments,such as alkaline,acid and oxidation agents, have been utilized in the activation of fiber surface (Angles et al. 2001; Geng et al. 2006; Schmidt et al. 2002; Young et al. 1985).Binderless fiberboards made from alkaline-treated black spruce bark possessed a higher IB，modulus of rupture (MOR） and modulus of elasticity (MOE) than those of untreated samples (Geng et al. 2Oo6). Compositions analysis revealed the occurrence of de-acetylation of wood fibers,as well as degradation of large amounts of lignin and hemicelluloses (Schmidt et al. 2OO2).These changes might explain the positive effect of alkaline treatment on the mechanical properties of binderless fiberboards.On the other hand,acid treatment was usually considered asa prehydrolysis before steam explosion due to its significant effect on the structure of raw materials (Angles et al. 2OO1). It was suggested that nitric acid activation of wood surfaces involved oxidation, nitration and hydrolysis of wood polymers (Rammon et al. 1982； Subramanian et al. 1982； Young et al. 1982). Therefore,the concentration and treatment time of alkaline and acid need to be carefully controlled in order to avoid excessive degradation of main components in raw materials. In this section,Fenton's reagent and laccase treatments were emphasized due to their possibilities in realization of the production of binderless fiberboards with satisfactory performance.Finally，addition of other components was also included considering their potential effect on the performance of binderless fiberboards.

# Chemical pretreatment of raw materials

# Fenton'sreagent

Fenton's reagent composed of ferrous chloride and hydrogen peroxide could activate the fiber surface.This oxidation pretreatment facilitated the adhesive bonding between fibers.The main reaction process was shown in the following equation:

$$
\mathrm { R H } + \mathrm { O H } \cdot  \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } + \mathrm { R } \cdot
$$

where hydroxyl radicals(OH·）was continuously generated by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with the assistance of ferrous ions.Then, these hydroxyl radicals were capable of reacting and attacking fibers and lignin to form reactive components (R·). The activated components were able to covalently bond with lowmolecular degraded components contributing to self-bonding in binderless fiberboards (Kharazipour et al.1998). On the other hand, intra-fiber crossing links were also created due to the diffusion of degraded low-molecular reagents into lumen within cell walls.These intra-fiber links are believed to increase the dimensional stability of fiberboards (Halvarsson et al.2OO9;Widsten 2002).

Halvarsson et al. (2Oo9) investigated the physical and mechanical properties of binderless fiberboards made from Fenton's reagent-treated wheat straw. The strength of fiberboards was further enhanced,and TS of fiberboards decreased when hydrogen peroxide percentage was increased from 2.5 to $4 . 0 \ \%$ . Specifically, TS and water adsorption (WA) of the fiberboards with best performance prepared with $4 . 0 \%$ hydrogen peroxide and $2 \%$ addition of $\mathbf { C a C l } _ { 2 }$ were 75 and $90 \%$ respectively (Halvarsson et al. 2Oo9).Furthermore,oil palm was subjected to Fenton's reagent oxidation $( 4 \mathrm { ~ \% , ~ H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } ) }$ ，and the treated fibers were then used to prepare binderless fiberboards at a pressing temperature of $1 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .TS and WA of obtained fiberboards were 35 and $48 \%$ ,respectively,which were lower than those of fiberboards made from treated wheat straw (Mejia et al. 2O14). Comparison of results indicated that the chemical components of different raw materials were a key factor for their suitability in the production of binderless fiberboards.While this method seemed to be an interesting direction of research,there were several weaknesses in terms of long-term harmful effect on the properties of fiberboards due to high peroxide charges,instability of board quality and insufficient mechanical strength unless high board densities (Widsten 2002).

# Enzymatic pretreatment of raw materials

The interest in enzymatic treatments of cellulosic fibers is recently growing (Kharazipour and Euring 2010, 2013; Euring et al. 201la,b; Kudanga et al. 2011). Compared with chemical treatments,enzymatic treatment often involves mild reaction condition, less by-products and being environmentally friendly (Euring et al.2O13).Laccase,which is widely distributed in plants and fungi, has been intensively studied in the pulp and paper industry.It can catalyze the oxidation of various phenolic substrates (Nyanhongo et al. 2O1O;Kudanga et al. 2OO8; Pereira et al.2Oo5).During the fiber treatments, laccase hardly penetrated into fibers and mainly oxidized the lignin on the surface (Alvarez et al. 2O11). As a result, free radicals were generated on the fiber surface.These free radicals can act as potential reactive sites for further cross-linking reactions in the production of fiberboards.The increase in molecular weight of lignin obtained from the surface of laccase-treated fiberboards strongly indicated the occurrence of polymerization of lignin (Felby et al.20o2). In the following equation,this process is described.

$$
4 \mathrm { P h e } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { O H } + \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } \stackrel { \mathrm { L a c c a s e } } { \longrightarrow } 4 \mathrm { P h e } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { O } \cdot + 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }
$$

Laccase pretreatment of beech fibers promoted their adhesion,and the obtained fiberboards possessed a significantly higher strength than that of untreated fibers. Depositions of lignin and formation of covalent bonds between fibers were believed to be highly responsible for improved bonding (Felby et al. 2OO4). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results of treated and untreated rubber fibers showed that enzyme-treated rubber fibers looked smooth due to lignin removal and breakdown of surface molecules in comparison with rough surface of untreated fibers (Fig.1). Nasir et al.(2Ol3）fabricated binderless fiberboards from rubber fibers treated at $9 ~ \mathrm { U / g }$ enzymes for $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and pressed at $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ It showed acceptable performance in terms of MOE,MOR and IB, but not WA and TS.Furthermore, it was suggested that the amounts of enzyme should be controlled in order to avoid excessive removal of lignin,resulting in a dramatic decrease in IB (Nasir et al. 2O13). Recently, manufacture of binderless fiberboards from enzyme pretreated lignocellulosic fibers has been reviewed,covering the effect of preheating temperature and wood type on fiberboard properties,as well as the evaluation of production methods (Widsten and Kandelbauer 2OO8; Mai et al. 2OO4). While enzymatic pretreatment has the potential to improve bonding strength,the attempts to industrially produce binderless fiberboards were difficult due to the presence of technical and economic problems,such as easy inactivation of enzyme under harsh conditions,the cost of enzyme and high investment of facilities.

# Addition of other compositions

Lignin is a component which naturally provides adhesion in wood structure.Ligninbased wood adhesives have been prepared and applied in board industry (Mansouri et al.2OO7).In the production of binderless fiberboards,lignin plasticization and cross-linking reaction between lignin and furfural have been considered to be partially responsible for board adhesion (Bouajila et al.2Oo5). Therefore，the addition of lignin was regarded as an effective method to enhance board properties. Angles et al. (2OO1) have presented the effect of addition of several kinds of lignin on board performance,and it turned out that dimensional stability and mechanical characteristics were significantly improved.Kraft lignin acted as the best candidate. With addition of kraft lignin ( $20 \%$ dry solid basis) to pretreated materials,TS and WA decreased from $1 2 . 9 \pm 1 . 2$ to $2 . 0 \pm 0 . 6 \%$ and $3 8 \pm 7 . 0$ to $7 . 0 \pm 0 . 3 \ \%$ respectively. Lignin could work as a plastic and resist water penetration, which then improves the dimensional stability of fiberboards.Moreover, the improvement of mechanical properties of fiberboards could be attributed to the fact that lignin as an adhesive provided more reactive sites,thus increasing the links between cellulose fibers(Angles et al. 2OO1). Similar conclusion was observed that the addition of kraft lignin prior to pretreatment improved the properties of binderless fiberboards made from steam-exploded Miscanthus sinensis.However,when the lignin was added after pretreatment, bubbles were observed at a high pressing temperature, which negatively influenced the properties of fiberboards.Oppositely,no bubbles were observed when adding lignin before pretreatment probably due to the better mixing and removal of low molecular weight compounds (Velasquez et al. 2003). Recently,binderless fiberboards made from poplar fibers with addition of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) exhibited significantly improved physical and mechanical properties. These lignins were produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated substrates to remove carbohydrates. However, oxygen-related functional groups and radicals were further generated in EHL due to their subjection to oxygen plasma treatment (Zhou et al. 2013).

In the production of binderless particleboards, sugars have also been considered as effective additive to improve the properties.After adding $20 \%$ glucose to oil palm biomass,MOR and IB were improved roughly from 5.0 to $1 3 . 5 \ \mathrm { M P a }$ and 0.6 to $1 . 7 \mathrm { M P a }$ ，respectively.TS and WA values also significantly decreased with the addition of glucose (Lamaming et al. 2O13). Briefly， the addition of other components was a promising method to improve the properties of boards in association with other pretreatments.

# Manufacturing process

Two distinct methods have been widely utilized in the production of fiberboards, namely“wet-forming” process and “dry-forming” process.Wet-forming process involves the distribution of cellulosic materials into water. Hydrogen bonds formation and thermosetting adhesive behavior of lignin are expected during heating and drying processes.Accordingly，less or none binders are needed. However,low density and limited strength of fiberboards,along with waste water pollution are the main disadvantages of this process. In dry-forming process, moisture content of cellulosic materials is reduced via drying before combination with resins.After distribution of mixture into mat,it undergoes prepress and hot pressing to finally produce fiberboards.While a wet process to produce binderless fiberboards from a combination of fibers and particles has been recently patented (Lee and Hunt 2O13),industrial manufacture of binderless fiberboards is mainly based on dry-forming process without resins addition. Furthermore,other processes such as steam explosion before hot pressing and steam injection pressing have been developed to increase the performance of binderless fiberboards. The main difference between steam explosion before hot pressing and conventional dryforming process was the employment of steam explosion to efciently expose components for further reaction in hot pressing. In the authors’ groups,microwave pretreatment has recently been further applied to the dry-forming process.It was observed that temperature of raw materials before pressing was rapidly increased with the assistance of microwave heating,and binderless fiberboards with a high density and thickness,as well as acceptable properties,were obtained (Zhang et al. 2014a).Detailed discussions about the current manufacturing process methods are presented in this section.

# Steam explosion before hot pressing

Preparation of binderless fiberboards traditionally undergoes hot pressing process. However, the fiberboards produced only under hot pressing generally showed poor performance in terms of water adsorption and thickness swelling.Although the addition of wax into fibers has been suggested to overcome this drawback (Felby et al. 20O2),steam explosion has been known as a more effective method to improve the dimensional stability of binderless fiberboards (Luo et al. 2O14).It was able to liberate lignin from inside of cell wall to the fiber surface. SEM analysis of broken fiberboards obtained from mixture of softwood residues indicated that liberated lignin covered hemicelluloses and cellulose,which limited these two hydrophilic polymers to adsorb waters.Consequently,the dimensional stability of binderless fiberboards was improved. It also suggested that steam pretreatment had the ability to cause de-fibration and generate numerous shrinkage folds on the surface. These changes facilitated the adhesion behavior owing to the increase in contact surface. In addition,lignin droplets were observed on the surface of fiber. It was believed that the softening point of these droplets was lower than original lignin,easily resulting in occurrence of plastic flow of lignin (Angles et al. 1999). Angles et al.

(1999) related pretreatment severity of steam to treatment time and temperature. Its effect on the properties of binderless fiberboards produced from steam-exploded residual softwood revealed that high severities within a certain range were able to correspondingly improve the physical and mechanical properties of fiberboards. The addition of acid during steam pretreatment promoted further hydrolysis of hemicelluloses and cellulose.As a result,WA and TS of fiberboards decreased. Furthermore, short fibers packed more compactly preventing water from penetrating into matrix,which also decreased WA and TS(Angles et al. 2001).

Steam explosion could also be applied to non-woody materials.Miscanthus sinensis was first subjected to steam explosion and then used to produce binderless fiberboards (Velasquez et al. 2OO3). Some basic parameters,especially TS and WA, met the requirement of relevant standard specifications.The increase in dimensional stability of the fiberboards is highly related to the decrease in hemicelluloses content (Velasquez et al. 2O03). Saari et al. (2014) investigated the properties of steamexploded binderless particleboards made from oil palm trunks.They observed that steam pretreatment could enhance the overall physical and mechanical characteristics of samples.As the increase in stream temperature and time,MOR and IB of fiberboards increased,and the values of TS and WA decreased.However,when increasing steam exposure time to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ， particle structure was destroyed,leading to reduction in strength properties. Therefore, longer steam exposure time was not recommended (Saari et al. 2014).

Shao et al.(2Oo9) have systematically characterized lignin obtained from steamexploded bamboo.Thermal gravimetric analysis(TG） and DSC analysis revealed that steam explosion showed the ability to decompose lignin since softening temperature of lignin was lower than that of original lignin. Cleavage of $\beta$ -0-4 linkages in lignin confirmed by ozonation and NMR analysis was observed (Shao et al. 2OO9). Considering that the generation of $\beta$ -O-4 linkages has been reported during the hot pressing (Saari et al. 2O14), it was suggested that steam treatment exposed more reactive sites of phenolic hydroxyl ends and that reaction between these sites are expected to contribute to self-bonding in the formation of binderless fiberboards.Although evidences of positive effect of steam pretreatment on the production of fiberboards have been found, drawbacks of this process involving high water and energy consumption should not be ignored.

# Hot pressing

The chemical components in biomass were able to achieve self-bonding under hot pressing. Therefore,pressing parameters such as temperature,time and pressure definitely influenced the properties of fiberboards. The effect of pressing temperature on the properties of binderless boards made from different raw materials such as oil palm truck and frond (Hashim et al.2O1O;Laemsak and Okuma 2000; Saadaoui et al. 2013), kenaf core (Okuda et al. 2006b) and Miscanthus sinensis(Velasquez et al. 2OO3） have been examined. It turned out that pressing temperature is one of the most important manufacturing parameters affecting the properties of boards.As the pressing temperature increases,MOR and IB were observed to increase and WA and TS of the fiberboards decreased.Similarly,Boon et al.(2O13） concluded that increase in temperature,time and pressure had the potential to improve the mechanical strength and stability of fiberboards against moisture. Pressing temperature seemed to be the most significant parameter, whereas pressure and pressing time did obviously not affect the properties of fiberboards.The temperature should be limited to below $2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in order to avoid severe burning. Given the energy consumption,a high pressing temperature is also not recommended.Therefore,further improvement of dimensional stability via the increase in temperature was not effective (Boon et al. 2O13). In addition，the presence of water in raw materials is crucial for the heat transfer during hot pressing.Effect of water content in feed materials (5-20 wt $\%$ ）on the properties of fiberboards suggested that the optimum condition was $8 \%$ moisture content,and higher moisture contents gave a negative effect on modulus (Hidayat et al. 2014).

# Steam injection pressing

Researches on steam injection pressing in large panel fabrication with southern hardwoods were carried out about 3O years ago (Geimer and Price 1987). Afterward, this technology was employed to produce binderless fiberboards from mixed softwood and hardwood. It turned out that there was a poor bonding strength, whereas the dimensional stability of fiberboards was improved (Okamoto et al. 1994).Recently, few researches on steam injection pressing in the production of binderless fiberboards can be found (Kwon and Geimer 1998; Troughton and Lum 2000;Xu et al. 2Oo5). Conversely, successful development of particleboards from kenaf core using steam injection pressing has been reported ( $\mathrm { \Delta X u }$ et al. 2003). The particleboards showed higher IB value （ $\mathrm { 0 . 4 3 \ M P a }$ ， $0 . 5 0 ~ \mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } ,$ ）and lower average TS ( $11 \%$ $0 . 5 0 ~ \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } ,$ than those of particleboards made under hot pressing,where IB was $0 . 0 9 \mathrm { M P a }$ and average TS was $169 \%$ . They also observed that mechanical properties of particleboards increased linearly with increasing board density. Furthermore,increase in steam pressure improved the bonding strength.Extension of steam treatment time from 7 to $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at a pressing pressure of $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { M P a }$ decreased TS from 16 to $9 . 4 ~ \%$ ,but had less effect on MOR.

Widyorini et al.(2Oo5c) further compared the effect of steam injection and hot pressing on the chemical changes of kenaf core in the production of particleboards. It was suggested that mild steam injection ( $_ { 0 . 6 - 1 . 0 \mathrm { M P a } }$ ， $7 { - } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ）gave rise to a significant degradation of lignin,cellulose and hemicelluloses compared with lowdegree degradation under hot pressing.With a steam pressing pressure of $1 . 0 \ \mathrm { M P a }$ ， the mean TS was $7 . 4 7 \ \%$ in contrast to $169 \%$ of TS under hot pressing at $1 9 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } .$ In addition, increase in steam injection pressure and time could further promote the degradation of main components. Difference in the manufacturing process significantly affected the properties of boards.In the case of steam injection, the temperature of boards increased rapidly by injecting high-pressure steam，and components degraded and then re-reacted in a very short period of time.In the case of hot pressing,it worked less efficiently since it took time for the steam to be generated from moisture in particles(Widyorini et al. 2Oo5c). Similar observation revealed that particleboards made from sugarcane bagasse by steam injection pressing showed relatively better properties than by hot pressing(Widyorini et al.

2005b). However， it was suggested that excessive steam resulted in serious decomposition of components and thus poor board properties.

# Self-bondingmechanism of binderless fiberboards

No matter whether woody or non-woody raw materials,pretreatment operations seem to be necessary for their further application. Mechanical, chemical, biological and thermochemical pretreatments have been employed separately or conjunctively depending on the expected products (Samaniego et al. 2013; Boonstra 2O08; Smith 2011).Given the difference of chemical and morphological properties of raw materials, moisture content, as well as manufacturing process, several self-bonding mechanisms of binderless fiberboards have been proposed (Pintiaux et al. 2O15). In the case of hot pressing,understanding the chemistry of substrates thermal reaction may benefit the understanding of the bonding mechanisms. Several reactions such as hydrolysis,dehydration and oxidation upon heating have been observed.Hemicelluloses were suggested to be easily removed due to their less thermal stability than cellulose and lignin (Hill 2006; Xu et al. 2006; Inoue et al. 1993;Rowell and McSweeny 2OO8). Organic acid,acetone and furfural were formed from the thermal decomposition of hemicelluloses (Tshabalala et al. 2Ol2).However, Okuda et al. (2006a) compared the chemical compositions of kenaf core and obtained binderless fiberboards. They observed that little furfurals were formed during the preparation of binderless fiberboards (Okuda et al. 2Oo6a). The discrepancy was probably the results of variations of detailed conditions,since the degradation of hemicelluloses has been reported to be highly dependent on moisture content, temperature, time of treatment and the composition of raw materials (Rowell and McSweeny 2008). Furthermore, Okuda et al. (2O06a） suggested that components decomposed from lignin during hot pressing could be extracted by methanol, indicating little contribution to self-bonding. They believed that condensation reactions in lignin and chemical reaction from conjugated carbonyl compounds played an important role in self-bonding (Okuda et al. 2006a).More recently，Alvarez et al. (2015) suggested that these organic extractives from leaf plantain decreased the reactivity of the surface of the fibers.Removal of organic extractives favored the contact between fibers.As a result,an increase in the mechanical properties of binderless boards was observed (Alvarez et al. 2Ol5). Conversely, removal of water extractives showed negative effects on the mechanical properties of boards. These water extractives with low molecular weight facilitated the formation of stable free radicals and therefore better bonding. In addition, Sun et al. (2O14) comparatively characterized lignin from raw materials and binderless fiberboards prepared under hot pressing, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis revealed that molecular weight of enzymatic/mild acidolysis lignin (EMAL) decreased from 2210 to $1 6 3 0 ~ \mathrm { g / m o l }$ .They also observed the formation of $\beta$ -O-4 linkages in EMAL after the production of fiberboards via NMR (Sun et al. 2O14).In the case of steam exposition, self-bonding mechanism seems to be more complex due to the presence of steam treatment (Fig. 2). Although Quintana et al. (20o9) observed no obvious cellulose degradation, depolymerization of hemicelluloses, lignin and cellulose has been widely accepted during the steam treatments (Sun et al. 2OO5; Takashashi et al. 2010). After investigating the chemical changes of steam injection and hot pressing, Widyorini et al.(2Oo5b） attributed the satisfactory performance of binderless particleboards using steam injection pressing to significant degradation of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Several researchers have noticed that the content of free sugars generated from hemicelluloses during steam pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials experienced an increase to maximum and then decreased in the yield.This indicated potential reactions of these sugars to other products (Rowell and McSweeny 2O08;Lawther et al.1996). Furthermore, furan monomers were found during the production of fiberboard (Cristescu and Karlsson 2O13；Fahmy and Mobarak 2O13; Tshabalala et al. 2O12). These monomers were believed to generate lignin-furfural linkages or undergo self-polymerization during the pressing,which provided the main self-bonding strength of binderless fiberboards (Suzuki et al. 1998; Yan et al. 1996). On the other hand, physical perspectives of materials have been observed to contribute to self-bonding. Cellulose can be hydrolyzed during steam pretreatment,and these new crystals work as reinforcement for the lignin/ hemicelluloses matrix,as well as contributing to the shape fixation and water resistance (Ito et al.1998; Saito et al. 2O13). Furthermore, it was also suggested that thermal softening of lignin played an important role in the properties of fiberboards (Okuda et al. 2006b;Van Dam et al. 2004).Bouajila et al. (2005) believed that in situ plasticization of lignin could increase the final mechanical properties.

Fig.2 Potential self-bonding mechanism in the production of binderless fiberboards with steam pretreatment (Fahmy and Mobarak 2O13; Sun et al.2O14; Suzuki et al.1998; Tshabalala et al.2012)

Although several acceptable mechanisms have been suggested to play an important role in the self-bonding,these observations were mainly based on the chemical changes of components before and after the production of fiberboards. Information on the chemical changes during the production of fiberboards is limited. Therefore,the optimization of pressing variables,such as pressure and temperature as a function of time,is difficult.Previous works by the authors have investigated the surface composition of wood fibers (Bixa orellana) using XPS.Raw materials were subjected to hot pressing in a high-pressure reactor as a simulation of real manufacturing process.The effect of hot pressing on the concentration of carbonyl groups is shown in Fig.3.Obviously,carbonyl groups content increased as the reaction proceeded within 2 min. This indicated that the degradation of cellulose and hemicelluloses to monosaccharides during hot pressing occurred. Additionally, the generation of furan monomers from dehydration of monosaccharides was also suggested to contribute to the increase in carbonyl groups content (Tshabalala et al. 2012). Then, carbonyl groups content gradually decreased until $6 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ due to the potential reaction of furan monomers. Self-bonding was achieved during this period. Finally,concentration of carbonyl groups slightly increased probably as the result of degradation of resin under continuous high pressure and temperature.These results obtained from XPS analysis of functional groups on the surface of fibers supported the observations that furan monomers were one of the main contributors to selfbonding of binderless fiberboards.Future work about the role of lignin and its degraded fractions in self-bonding is still needed.

# Future researches

Although researches on the production of binderless fiberboards have been ongoing for many years, it is still challenging to scale up their production from bench scale to pilot and industry levels.The obstacle which limited its commercialization is the difficulties in elucidation of self-bonding mechanism of binderless fiberboards. Therefore，the cost and the performance of products are not competitive with commercial resin-based fiberboards.In view of traditional resin-based fiberboards which are environmentally unfriendly, efforts to reduce the cost and improve the physical and mechanical properties of binderless fiberboards still need to be continued. This review here may offer a new insight to figure out the self-bonding mechanisms, particularly the role of lignin and furan during hot pressing process via state-of-the-art technologies in terms of FT-IR,XPS and solid-state NMR.On the other hand,extensive efforts should also be put on the investigation of other efficient approaches to prepare binderless fiberboards,such as laccase-mediator system,as well as effective pretreatment methods to utilize natural components in the fibers.
