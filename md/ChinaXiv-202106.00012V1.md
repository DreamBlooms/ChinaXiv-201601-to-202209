Abstract: The soil type is a key factor influencing $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ (nitrogen) cycling in soil; however, gross N transformations and $_ \mathrm { N _ { 2 } O }$ emission sources are still poorly understood. In this study, a laboratory $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ tracing experiment was carried out at $60 \%$ WHC (water holding capacity and $2 5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { { C } }$ to evaluate the gross N transformation rates and $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission pathways in sandy loam and silt loam soils in a semi-arid region of Heilongjiang Province， China. The results showed that the gross rates of $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification were 3.60, 1.90,and $5 . 6 3 \mathrm { ~ m g ~ N } / ( \mathrm { k g } { \cdot } \mathrm { d } )$ in silt loam soil, respectively, which were 3.62, 4.26,and 3.13 times those in sandy loam soil, respectively. The ratios of the gross nitrification rate to the ammonium immobilization rate $( n / i _ { a } )$ in sandy loam soil and silt loam soil were all higher than 1.00,whereas the ${ \boldsymbol n } / i _ { a }$ in sandy loam soil (4.36) was significantly higher than that in silt loam soil (3.08). This result indicated that the ability of sandy loam soil to release and conserve the available N was relatively poor in comparison with silt loam soil, and the relatively strong nitrification rate compared to the immobilization rate may lead to $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ loss through $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } -$ leaching. Under aerobic conditions, both nitrification and denitrification made contributions to $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions. Nitrification was the dominant pathway leading to $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ production in soils and was responsible for $8 2 . 0 \%$ of the total emitted $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ in sandy loam soil, which was significantly higher than that in silt loam soil $( 7 1 . 7 \% )$ . However, the average contribution of denitrification to total $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ production in sandy loam soil was $1 7 . 9 \%$ ，which was significantly lower than that in silt loam soil $( 2 8 . 3 \% )$ . These results are valuable for developing reasonable fertilization management and proposing efective greenhouse gas mitigation strategies in diferent soil types in semiarid regions.

# 1 Introduction

Soil N transformations are microbially mediated processes and are affected by a range of factors, such as moisture content, temperature,cultivation, soil type, and land use type (Hoyle et al., 2006; Lan et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2019). Among these factors, the soil type has been considered to be one of the most important regulating factors. There are many studies about the effect of soil type on $\mathbf { N }$ (nigtrogen) transformations via the investigation of net rates (Grünzweig et al., 2003; Tripathi and Singh, 2OO9; Yang et al., 2O1O). However, net mineralization or nitrification rates are only valuable for indicating the $\mathbf { N }$ availability for plants and cannot provide detailed information on the production and consumption processes of soil inorganic $\mathbf { N }$ (Murphy et al., 2003). Alternatively, gross $\mathbf { N }$ transformation rates quantified by the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotope-labelling technique can estimate the gross rates of N mineralization, nitrification, and immobilization, respectively, which provide deeper and fundamental understandings of the $\mathbf { N }$ cycle inherent in the soil (Muller et al., 2007).

${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ is an important greenhouse gas that is involved in global warming and the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer (Byrnes, 199O). Agricultural soil is an important source of $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions, being responsible for $70 \%$ of anthropogenic emissions (Kroeze et al., 1999). ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ is mainly produced from two biological processes in soil, namely, nitrification and denitrification (Stevens et al.， 1997). These two processes are considered to occur simultaneously due to soil heterogeneity, which allows for aerobic and anaerobic zones to coexist in soil aggregates (Steven et al.， 1997). However, the magnitude of $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions derived from nitrification and denitrification depends on many factors such as temperature, moisture content, fertilizer, and soil type (Dobbie and Smith, 2001; Khalil et al., 2004; Pihlatie et al.,2004; Lan et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019; Castellano-Hinojosa et al., 202O; Li et al., 202O), among which soil type is regarded as one of the most important controllers. Although some studies have estimated the specific processes leading to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions from different soils, the results were varied. For example, most studies showed that $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ was mainly released via nitrification at $30 \%$ to $60 \%$ water filled pore space (WFPS) in agricultural soils (Steven et al., 1997; Pihlatie et al., 2OO4; Bateman and Baggs,2005; Well et al.， 2008; Lan et al., 2014). However, Zhu et al. (2011) reported that denitrification was the dominant source of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions from agricultural soils at $50 \%$ water holding capacity (WHC),and Li et al. (2O16) indicated that the contribution of the denitrification process to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emissions was larger than $50 \%$ at $40 \%$ to $60 \%$ WFPS in a sandy loam soil. The discrepancy of these results could result from the differences in soil texture, $\mathrm { \ p H }$ ，and the availability of C and N. However, the underlying mechanisms and regulations are still not well understood.

The semi-arid region of Heilongjiang Province is an important agricultural area of Northeast China, sandy loam and silt loam soils are two typical agricultural soil types distributed in this region, where maize crops are grown annually. Large amounts of $\mathbf { N }$ fertilizer have been applied every year to increase the crop yield (Wang et al.， 2O13),and excessive $\mathbf { N }$ inputs are of environmental concern as they can cause water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It is especially crucial to better understand the N transformations under these two typical soil types to optimize fertilizer management and increase $\mathbf { N }$ use efficiency. However, there are few studies on the characteristics of gross $\mathbf { N }$ transformations in the agricultural soils of the semi-arid region. In addition, since soil ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions are mainly controlled by nitrification and denitrification, the contribution of these two processes to $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions in soils are need to be studied to well understand the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emission sources for different soil textures of the semiarid region， to accurately estimate the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ inventories and plan mitigation strategies.

In this study, the aims were (1) to elucidate the gross $\mathbf { N }$ transformation rates in sandy loam and silt loam soils, and (2) to assess the relative importance of nitrification and denitrification on $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions under aerobic conditions. To meet these objectives, the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ tracing technique was used under laboratory incubation conditions to identify the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emission sources in the two agricultural soils with substantially different soil properties, and the gross $\mathbf { N }$ transformations were calculated with the FLUAZ model.

# 2Materials and methods

# 2.1 Study site and soil sampling

The study sites were located in Qiqihar City $( 4 5 ^ { \circ } 5 3 ^ { \prime } - 4 8 ^ { \circ } 5 6 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ $1 2 2 ^ { \circ } 2 4 ^ { \prime } – 1 2 6 ^ { \circ } 4 1 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E } )$ , in southwest Heilongjiang Province, China, which has a typical temperate continental semiarid monsoon climate. Precipitation is rare and strong winds occur frequently in spring. The annual mean temperature is $2 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and the mean annual precipitation is $4 5 4 . 0 \mathrm { m m }$ ,approximately $70 \%$ of which falls between June and September (Jiang et al., 2O14). Two types of soil samples were collected from agricultural fields in this study and were classified as sandy loam and silt loam soil, according to the soil texture classification system issued by International Society of Soil Science. The conventional cropping practice of the study filed is the continuous cultivation of corn from May to October every year, with a mean annual $\mathbf { N }$ fertilizer application of approximately $7 5 0 \ \mathrm { k g } \ \mathrm { N } / \mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ The soil types used for this study represent typical cultivated soils, as sandy loam soil and silt loam soil cover approximately $6 . 6 8 \%$ and $5 . 2 9 \%$ , respectively, of the local agricultural land area (Du et al., 1994).

Soil sampling was conducted after the crop harvest in October, 2O18. For each soil type, three sites that were $1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m } { \times } 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m }$ in area were chosen randomly as space replications. At each site, three plots $( 4 ~ \mathrm { m } { \times } 4 ~ \mathrm { m } )$ were randomly established,and four soil cores ( $5 \ \mathrm { c m }$ in diameter) were collected at a depth of $0 { - } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ from the 4 sampling quadrates $( 2 \mathrm { m } { \times } 2 \mathrm { m } )$ of each plot. A total of 12 soil cores from one replicated site were pooled to form a composite sample. The roots and plant litter in the soil were picked out by hand, and then all of the soils were passed through a $2 \mathrm { - m m }$ sieve and split into two subsamples. One soil subsample was stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before being used for incubation in one week and the other was air-dried to measure the basic physical and chemical properties.

# 2.2 $\mathbf { \Delta } ^ { 1 5 } \mathbf { N }$ tracing experiment

$^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ tracing experiment was carried out using the method of Lang et al. (2010) with some modifications. Briefly, there were two $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled treatments (each with three replicates) in this study, $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled ammonium $\mathrm { ( ^ { 1 5 } N H _ { 4 } N O _ { 3 } ) }$ and $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled nitrate $\mathrm { ( N H _ { 4 } ^ { 1 5 } N O _ { 3 } ) }$ with a $5 \mathrm { - a t o m \% }$ of $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess . For each of the studied soils, $3 0 \mathrm { g }$ (dry weight basis) of fresh soil was weighed into 30 ( $2 ~ ^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled treatments $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { s x } } 3$ replicatesx5 sampling times $\scriptstyle \operatorname { \ i = } 3 0$ ）Erlenmeyer flasks( $( 2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L } )$ ： Each $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labled ${ \mathrm { N H } } _ { 4 } { \mathrm { N O } } _ { 3 }$ solution was added to 15 flasks at a volume of $1 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ to reach a final applied $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ concentration of $4 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } ~ \mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } \mathrm { - N / g } }$ soil or $4 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g } } ~ \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } \mathrm { { ^ - - N } / g }$ soil,and then the soil was adjusted to a water content of $60 \%$ WHC. The flasks were sealed with silicone rubber stoppers and incubated for $^ \textrm { \scriptsize 7 d }$ at $2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under dark conditions. During the incubation period, the stopper was removed for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ every day to maintain the aerobic condition of the soil, and the water lost through the process of evaporation was compensated as needed by adding deionized water via a pipette.

At day O, 1, 3, 5,and 7 after the addition of the $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } N O _ { 3 } }$ solution, gas samples inside the flasks were collected. For each sampling time, three replicate flasks of each $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled treatment were randomly selected and flushed three times with room air using a multiport vacuum manifold (for $4 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ each time)，and then immediately sealed with silicone rubber stoppers (with a gas collection port） for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ . When sampling, the headspace gas inside the flask was sufficiently mixed through repeated extracting and injecting for 5 times with a gas-tight syringe. Subsequently, a $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ volume of the headspace gas was collected and injected into $1 2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ pre-evacuated vials to determine the concentration and the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O } { - \bf N }$ using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatogram (Agilent Technologies， USA） and a Finnigan MAT 253 mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA), respectively.

After gas sampling, soil samples were extracted with 2 mol/L KCl solution (at a soil to water ratio of 1.0:2.5) by shaking for $^ { \textrm { 1 h } }$ at $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { r / m i n }$ with a mechanical rotary shaker. The solution was then filtered into $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ plastic bottles through filter paper and stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to determine the concentration and $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ and ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ within one week. To analyze the concentrations and $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } { - } N }$ and $N O _ { 3 } ^ { - } { } ^ { - } { \bf \Delta } ^ { }$ in the labeled soil, we used the steam distillation method to separate $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ and $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ . In detail, a $1 0 \mathrm { - m L }$ volume of the KCl extracted solution was first steam distilled with magnesium oxide to separate $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } ^ { + }$ ，and then distilled again with Devarda's alloy to separate $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ . During the distillation process, $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ and ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ were liberated in the form of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ and were absorbed in $5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of a ${ \mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { S O } } _ { 4 }$ solution (0.010 $\mathrm { \ m o l / L } )$ . To prevent the cross contamination of the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess between samples, we distilled $2 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m L }$ of ethyl alcohol after each sample to clean the distillation system. The concentrations of $\mathrm { { N H _ { 4 } } ^ { + } { - N } }$ and $N O _ { 3 } \mathrm { ^ - N }$ were determined by titrating the superfluous ${ \mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { S O } } _ { 4 }$ with $0 . 0 1 0 \ \mathrm { m o l / L } \ \mathrm { N a O H }$ ， Afterward, the titrated solution was acidified with $0 . 0 0 5 \mathrm { \ m o l / L \ H _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } }$ to reach a $\mathrm { \ p H }$ of 3 to avoid microbial contamination and dried at $6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in an oven until reaching constant weight. The dried matter was packed into a tin capsule used for the analysis of $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess with a stable isotope mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT 253 mass spectrometer, Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). The extracted soil was washed three times with $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of deionized water to remove the residual KCl, and then the soil was dried at $6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and fine ground with a ball grinder. Then, a portion of the soil was packed into a tin capsule to measure the concentration and $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of organic $\mathbf { N }$ with a CN analyzer (NA Series 2, Capillary Electrophoresis Instruments, Italy) linked with the stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer.

# 2.3Soil property analysis

The soil samples were stirred quickly with a glass bar for $1 \mathrm { m i n }$ after adding deionized water (at a soil to water ratio of 1.O:2.5), and then left to stand for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ to measure the $\mathrm { \ p H }$ of the soil suspension with a $\mathrm { D M P - 2 \ m V / p H }$ detector (Quark Ltd., China). The soil WHC was determined after water logging the air-dried soil for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and natural draining for $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ (Fierer and Schimel, 2002). The particle size distribution was measured using the hydrometer method after dispersion of the soil with pyrophosphate for $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ . The sand, silt, and clay contents are expressed as a percentage by mass of the dispersed soil. The soil organic carbon (SOC) was analyzed by titration with $\mathrm { F e S O _ { 4 } }$ after digestion of the soil using $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } { - } \mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C r } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 7 }$ , and the total $\mathbf { N }$ (TN) was analyzed via a semi micro Kjeldahl digestion with a ${ \mathrm { K } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { S O } } _ { 4 }$ ， $\mathrm { C u S O _ { 4 } }$ , and Se power mixture as the catalysts. We determined water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and water soluble organic $\mathbf { N }$ (WSON) according to Burford and Bremner (1975). The inorganic N $\mathrm { ( N H _ { 4 } ^ { + }  – N }$ and $N { \cal O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - } { - } \mathbf { N } )$ in the air-dried soil was extracted with 2 mol/L KCl(at a soil to water ratio of 1.O:2.5) on a mechanical shaker for $6 0 \ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ and then filtered. The concentrations of $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } { - } N }$ and $N O _ { 3 } { } ^ { - } { - } \mathbf { N }$ in the filtrate were determined using a continuous-flow analyzer (Skalar Analytical Corporation, Netherlands).

# 2.4 Calculation and statistical analysis

The gross rates of $\mathbf { N }$ transformations were calculated by the FLUAZ model (Mary et al., 1998). The calculations of this model are based on the isotopic dilution and enrichment principles. It uses a numerical fourth order Runge-Kuta algorithm with a variable time-step to solve the differential system, and a non-linear fiting program (based on Marquardt's algorithm) to calculate the unknown $\mathbf { N }$ transformation rates between the $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } { - } N }$ ， ${ \bf N O } _ { 3 } { \bf \bar { \Psi } } { \bf - N }$ ，and organic $\mathbf { N }$ pools. Minimizing the mean weighted error (MWE) is used as a criterion instead of the sum of squares when optimal fiting of the experimental data, which accounts for the variance of the measurements and normalizing of various variables (Mary et al., 1998). In the present study, five gross $\mathbf { N }$ transformation rates were estimated by the FLUAZ model, gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization rate $( m , \mathrm { ~ m g ~ N / ( k g \cdot d ) } )$ ， gross nitrification rate $( n , \mathrm { ~ m g ~ N / ( k g \cdot d ) } )$ ， gross $\mathbf { N }$ immobilization rate $( i , \ \mathrm { m g }$ $N / ( \mathrm { k g } { \cdot } \mathrm { d } ) )$ ， $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } }$ immobilization rate $( i _ { a } , \ \mathrm { m g } \ \mathrm { N } / ( \mathrm { k g } { \cdot } \mathrm { d } ) )$ ，and ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ immobilization rate $( i _ { n } , \ \mathrm { m g }$ $\mathrm { { N } / ( k g \cdot d ) ) }$ from the measurements of the amounts and $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excesses of $\mathrm { { N H _ { 4 } } ^ { + } { - N } }$ $N O _ { 3 } { } ^ { - } { - } \mathbf { N }$ and organic $\mathbf { N }$ . The time-weighted average rates for the whole incubation period were calculated in addition to the individual time interval rates. The $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ flux was calculated according to Lang et al. (2011). The $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emission fractions derived from nitrification and denitrification were calculated as described by Steven et al. (1997). Within the two emission pools in their model, the contribution of denitrification $( d )$ and nitrification $( 1 { - } d )$ to the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions could be calculated from the $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } } ^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N O _ { 3 } }$ labeled treatment, and the equation is shown as follows:

$$
d = \frac { a _ { m } - a _ { n } } { a _ { d } - a _ { n } } , a _ { d } \neq a _ { n } ,
$$

where $a _ { m }$ is the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ mixture $( \mathrm { a t o m } \%$ ), $a _ { n }$ is the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ $( \mathrm { a t o m } \% )$ ; and $a _ { d }$ is the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N O _ { 3 } } ^ { - } \left( \mathrm { a t o m } \% \right)$

Differences in the measured soil properties and the time-weighted average gross N transformation rates between sandy loam and silt loam soils were assessed by paired sample

$t \cdot$ -tests.All of the statistical analyses were carried out by SPSS 13.O (IBM, USA).

# 3.1Soil properties

As shown in Table 1, there were significant differences in soil properties between the sandy loam and silt loam soils. The sandy loam soil had a sand content of $8 0 . 5 \%$ ，which was significantly higher than that of silt loam soil $( 2 3 . 4 \% )$ , while the silt and clay contents in sandy loam soil were $1 1 . 1 \%$ and $8 . 4 0 \%$ , respectively, which were significantly lower than those in silt loam soil. The WHC， SOC， TN， WSOC， WSON, $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ ，and $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ contents in sandy loam soil were all significantly lower compared to those in silt loam soil, whereas no significant difference in pH between these two soils was found.

# 3.2 Concentrations and $\mathbf { \Delta } ^ { 1 5 } \mathbf { N }$ isotopic excess of inorganic N

For the two studied soils, there was an obvious decrease in the $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } }$ concentration and increase in the $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ concentration with time, indicating that net nitrification occurred (Fig. 1). The decrease in the $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ concentration and increase in the ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ concentration were larger in the silt loam soil than in the sandy loam soil. In the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N } \mathrm { H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ treatments for both soils, the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ decreased over time (Fig. 2a and b), indicating that the natural abundance of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ resulting from the mineralization of native organic $\mathbf { N }$ was continuously input into the $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ pool. In the same $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled treatment, the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ increased gradually during the whole incubation period due to the input of nitrified $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ labeled with $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ .In the $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } } ^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N O _ { 3 } }$ labeled treatments, the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ was very low and no significant change was observed between each sampling time (Fig. 2c and d), suggesting that for the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ ，the remineralization of the immobilized ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { \bf \bar { \Sigma } }$ and the reduction of ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ to $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ could be neglected. Conversely, in the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ labeled ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ treatment, the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess in the ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ pool decreased over time, which was caused by the nitrification of the naturally abundant $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ containing $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ pool (Fig. 2b and d). The $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ in silt loam soil increased much faster than that in sandy loam soil in the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N } \mathrm { H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ spiked treatment (Fig. 2a and b), which was consistent with the faster decrease of the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ in silt loam soil than in sandy loam soil in the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - } .$ spiked treatment (Fig. 2c and d), indicating that nitrification was stronger in the silt loam soil.

# 3.3Gross nitrogen transformations

For silt loam soil, the gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization rate reached its highest value during the first time interval and then decreased gradually until the end (Table 2). However, the gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization rate in sandy loam soil showed an initial increase until it peaked during the time interval of day 3 to 5 and declined thereafter. The average gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization rate in silt loam soil was 3.595 $\mathrm { m g \ N / ( k g { \cdot } d ) }$ ，which was 3.62 times that in sandy loam soil $( 0 . 9 9 3 \mathrm { ~ m g ~ N / ( k g \cdot d ) } )$ (Fig. 3). Similar temporal patterns in the gross $\mathbf { N }$ immobilization rates were observed in sandy loam and silt loam soils,and were generally characterized by the highest rates during the first time interval and a subsequent decrease towards the end of the incubation period (Table 2). The average gross N immobilization rate in silt loam soil was $1 . 8 9 7 \mathrm { ~ m g ~ N / ( k g \cdot d ) }$ ， which was 4.26 times that in sandy loam soil $\left( 0 . 4 4 5 \mathrm { ~ m g ~ N / ( k g \cdot d ) } \right)$ (Fig. 3). The gross nitrification rate in sandy loam soil remained nearly constant over the first $5 \mathrm { d }$ , and then dropped sharply, whereas the gross nitrification rate in silt loam soil peaked during the time interval of day 1 to 3 and then decreased (Table 2). The average gross nitrification rate in silt loam soil was $5 . 6 3 2 ~ \mathrm { m g } ~ \mathrm { N } / ( \mathrm { k g } { \cdot } \mathrm { d } )$ ,which was 3.13 times that in sandy loam soil $1 . 7 9 6 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { N } / ( \mathrm { k g } { \cdot } \mathrm { d } ) )$ (Fig. 3).

From the results calculated by the FLUAZ model, we can see that both $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ and $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ were immobilized in silt loam soil and sandy loam soil over the whole incubation period (Table 2). However, the immobilization rates of $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } }$ were much higher than those of ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ for each time interval in both soils (Table 2). The amount of $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } }$ immobilized accounts for $7 0 . 2 \%$ to $9 8 . 0 \%$ of all immobilized $\mathbf { N }$ , demonstrating that microbes prefer to utilize $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ rather than $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$

The ratio of the gross nitrification rate to the $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } ^ { + }$ immobilization rate $( n / i _ { a } )$ could be used to indicate the dominant consumption pathway of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ in the soil. For sandy loam soil, the ratio of $n / i _ { a }$ was 4.36, which was significantly higher than that of silt loam soil (3.08).

# 3.4 $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ flux and sources

In silt loam soil, the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux increased sharply from day 1 to 3 and then declined quickly over the remaining incubation time. In sandy loam soil, the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux showed a slow increase from day 1 to 5,followed by a gradual decrease until the end of the incubation time (Fig. 4). For each sampling time, the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux in silt loam soil was significantly higher than that in sandy loam soil $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ . The average time-weighted ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ flux over the incubation period in silt loam soil was $4 9 0 \ \mathrm { n g }$ ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O } / ( { \bf k g } \cdot { \bf h } )$ ， which was significantly higher than that in sandy loam soil ( $1 7 4 \ \mathrm { n g }$ ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O } / ( { \bf k g } { \bf \cdot h } ) )$

For the two studied soils, the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ pool was always between the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ and ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ pool for both the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N } \mathrm { H } _ { 4 } \mathrm { N } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { 1 5 } N O _ { 3 } }$ treatments (Fig. 2), and the $^ { 1 5 } \mathrm { N }$ isotopic excess of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ was closer to that of the $\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } }$ pool. This result demonstrated that ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ was derived from both nitrification and denitrification processes, but nitrification led to more ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emissions than denitrification. The ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emission fraction derived from nitrification and denitrification varied with the sampling time (Fig. 5). The relative contribution of denitrification to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions tended to first increase and then decrease with time in silt loam soil, whereas this value showed a pattern of decrease-increase-decrease in sandy loam soil. The opposite trend was observed for the relative contribution of nitrification to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions in the two soils. For both soils, nitrification was the dominant source contributing to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emissions, as the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission fraction derived from nitrification was significantly higher than that from denitrification over the whole incubation period (Fig. 5). In sandy loam soil, the average contribution of nitrification to the total ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ production $( 8 2 . 1 \% )$ was significantly higher than that in silt loam soil $( 7 1 . 7 \% )$ , and the average contribution of denitrification to total ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ production was $1 7 . 9 \%$ , which was significantly lower than that in silt loam soil $( 2 8 . 3 \% )$

# 4Discussion

# 4.1 Nitrogen transformation rates

Soil $\mathbf { N }$ transformations are microbially regulated processes that are influenced by a range of factors,among which soil type is regarded as one of the most important controllrs (Cookson et al., 2007; Lang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2019). Our research also supports this general assertion.

The present study showed that the gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization and immobilization rates were significantly lower in sandy loam than in silt loam soil. The reason for the lower rates of gross $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ turnover may be due to the lower C (carbon) content in sandy loam soil (Table 1). It has been suggested that soil C could provide the substrate and energy for microbe growth in soil, as the positive correlations between SOC or WSOC and gross N turnover rates have been reported in many studies (Cookson et al., 2007; Lang et al., 2010, 2016; Zhang et al., 2013). Therefore, the higher contents of SOC and WSOC in silt loam compared to sandy loam soil may promote the growth and propagation of microorganisms and thus result in higher rates of N mineralization and immobilization. However, some studies showed that the gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization rate was more influenced by the SOC content in soil and was not affected by the quality of the substrate, while the immobilization process was mainly affected by the availability of soluble organic C (Hoyle et al., 2006), since the microbes participating in the process of mineralization could use a wide variety of complex organic substrates and microbes that dominate the immobilization process could only utilize simple organic carbohydrate (Gibbs and Barraclough,1998). Thus, it is possible that the higher gross N mineralization and immobilization rates in silt loam compared with sandy loam soil could be attributed to the higher contents of SOC and WSOC, respectively, in silt loam soil.

In accordance with gross N mineralization and immobilization rates, gross nitrification rate in sandy loam soil was also lower than that in silt loam soil. In view of the similar $\mathrm { p H }$ of sandy loam and silt loam soils, some other factors such as $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ availability and SOC may regulate the nitrification process in these two soils (Hart et al., 1994). Kuroiwa et al. (2011) reported strong correlations between the gross nitrification and mineralization rates and soil C concentrations, which was consistent with the results in this study, suggesting that the quantity of SOC controls the gross nitrification rate by regulating the gross mineralization rate， which engenders the available $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ for the nitrifiers. The relatively lower SOC content and gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization rate in sandy loam compared to silt loam soil may therefore contribute to the lower gross nitrification rate in the former. In addition to SOC, soil texture may be another crucial parameter influencing gross nitrification (Pereira e Silva et al., 2O12). Gross nitrification rates were found to correlate positively with the clay content and negatively with the sand content (Elrys et al., 2020), which is in agreement with our findings. The lower gross nitrification rate in sandy loam soil than in silt loam soil may be attribute to the following reasons. First, little available $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ is produced via the exchange equilibrium in sandy soil (Aulakh et al., 1996). Second, the abundance and diversity of nitrifying bacteria is high in soil with larger clay content (Hosny,1979; Elrys et al., 2020). Third, the cation exchange capacity of soil rich in clay is strong， thus the $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ concentration in the soil solution can be reduced to levels that are nontoxic for microorganisms (Lam et al., 2O18). Our results highlight that the soil texture and SOC content maybe the dominant factors controlling the gross nitrification rates in sandy loam and silt loam soils.

In soils under laboratory incubation conditions, nitrification and immobilization are the two main consumption fates for $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ in soil. The ratio of the gross nitrification rate to the ammonium immobilization rate could reflect the dominant pathway of $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ consumption and usually be used as an effective indicator for assessing ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ leaching (Stockdale et al., 2002; Murphy et al., 2003). In this study, the $n / i _ { a }$ ratio of sandy loam soil (4.36) and silt loam soil (3.08) were both higher than 1.0O, suggesting a very strong risk of ${ \mathrm { N O } } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ leaching in these two soils. However， the significantly low rates of gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization and immobilization and high ratio of $n / i _ { a }$ in sandy loam soil indicated that sandy loam soil has relatively weak capacity for the production and conservation of available $\mathbf { N }$ and is more vulnerable for ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ leaching in comparison with silt loam soil.

# 4.2 $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emission pathways

Our study showed that $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions from silt loam soil was significantly higher than that from sandy loam soil, which is in agreement with the previous findings of Pihlatie et al. (2004) and Syväsalo et al. (2OO4), who indicated that the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ in soils was larger in clay than in loamy sand soil. The high ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emission in silt loam soil could probably be attributed to the high contents of C and N, which could provide enough substrates for nitrification and denitrification. Furthermore, the significantly high clay content in silt loam soil may be favorable to build up anaerobic microsites, creating conditions conducive to denitrification processes and more $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions (Smith, 1980).

Under aerobic incubation conditions, nitrification was the dominant process in regulating the production of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ in soil; however, denitrification also plays an important role in ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ formation. For example, Bateman and Baggs (2OO5) indicated that in agricultural soils with $6 0 . 0 \%$ and $5 0 . 0 \%$ WFPS, $1 8 . 5 \%$ and $2 3 . 9 \%$ of the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ was emitted from denitrification, respectively. Pihlatie et al. (2004) found that when the water content was adjusted to $60 \%$ WFPS in peat, clay, and loamy sand soils, the proportion of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ produced by denitrification reached a percentage of $2 2 . 0 \%$ to $3 3 . 0 \%$ ： Lan et al. (2O13) demonstrated that denitrification contributed to $1 6 . { \bar { 3 } } \%$ and $23 . 9 \%$ of the total ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission in two paddy soils when the water content was $6 5 . 0 \%$ WHC. In the present study, the average contribution of denitrification to the whole ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emission was $1 8 . 0 \%$ and $2 8 . 3 \%$ in sandy loam and silt loam soil, respectively， which was in accordance with these findings. The great contribution of denitrification to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions suggests that denitrification occurred under aerobic conditions, even though the gross denitrification rates calculated by the FLUAZ model was close to zero in both soils (data not shown). The large amount of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission might be resulting from the formation of anaerobic microsites. Renault and Stengel (1994) pointed out that the fast growth of microbes consumed a large amount of oxygen in soil aggregates， leading to anoxic microenvironments. Additionally, anaerobic microsites may be formed in aerobic soils with high clay contents and high nitrification rates, since rapid nitrification would limit the supply of $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ and a high clay content may prevent the diffusion of $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ (Smith，198O),resulting in anaerobic environments where denitrification can occur. Moreover, when the $\mathbf { N }$ solution was added into the soil via pipetes, the solution could not be distributed uniformly in the soil aggregates; thus, some aggregates may be saturated and conductive to denitrification. Garrido et al. (2OO2) also reported the occurrence of aerobic denitrification in soil, but the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood.

As discussed above, the low clay content and low rate of gross nitrification in sandy loam soil in comparison with silt loam soil (Table 1） may be the reason for the lower contribution of denitrification to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions in sandy loam soil $( 1 7 . 9 \% )$ than in silt loam soil $( 2 8 . 3 \% )$ . Our result is in agreement with Pihlatie et al. (2OO4), who found that the contribution of denitrification to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions was lower in loamy sand $( 2 2 . 5 \% )$ than that in clay soil $( 3 3 . 5 \% )$ under aerobic conditions. Of the physical properties of mineral soils, the soil texture, macro- and micro-porosity, and soil aeration are important factors regulating the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emission pathways (Simojoki and Jaakkola, 2OoO). Sandy loam soil would have larger macro-porosity, allowing for the transport and supply of oxygen, which would be unfavorable for the occurrence of denitrification in soil. Our results are supported by Pihlatie et al. (2OO4),who reported that nitrification was still the dominant process contributing to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission events at $100 \%$ WFPS for loamy sand soil that was visibly water logged. Castellano-Hinojosa et al. (202O) also showed that in a sandy loam soil incubated at $80 \%$ WFPS, $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ was emitted mainly from nitrification rather than denitrification, indicating the good aerobic property of sandy loam soil, which is favorable for nitrification.

Our results are consistent with most published results, which show that nitrification was the main pathway to produce ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ under aerobic conditions (Steven et al., 1997; Pihlatie et al., 2004; Well et al., 2008; Lan et al.， 2014). In contrast, there are also some studies showed that denitrification was the dominant pathway of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission under aerobic conditions.For example, Zhang et al. (2O11) indicated that denitrification accounted for $5 3 . 5 \%$ to $56 . 1 \%$ of the total ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ production in four acidic forest soils incubated at aerobic conditions ( $40 \%$ to $52 \%$ WFPS). Li et al. (2016) reported that denitrification was estimated to contribute to more than $50 \%$ of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions in loamy sand soil at $40 \%$ to $60 \%$ WFPS when adding crop residues. The possible reason behind the different result of Zhang et al. (2O11) may be that fungi prevailed in acid forest soils,and the denitrification manipulated by fungi was an important ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission source in acidic forest soil due to the potential lack of the $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ reductase in fungal biomass (Laughlin and Stevens, 2O02). In the study of Li et al. (2016), the incorporation of crop residues resulted in the large consumption of oxygen, thus leading to the predominance of denitrification as a source of $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ . As a result, the rates at which the two processes (nitrification and denitrification) dominate ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ release under aerobic conditions are influenced by the soil type and substrate supply.

The results here indicated that the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emission fraction from nitrification and denitrification fluctuated during the 7 d incubation time in sandy loam and silt loam soils, which is in agreement with Khalil et al. (2004), Li and Lang (2014) and Li et al. (2016), who also found the same phenomenon in unsaturated soils. However, Stevens et al. (1997) found that the contribution of denitrification to $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions decreased after two days of incubation, regardless of the water content in the soil. Additionally， in some cases， the ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emission fraction derived from denitrification increased with time under aerobic conditions (Wolf and Russow, 2Ooo; Lan et al., 2013). The conflicting results between these studies may be related to the soil type, incubation time or availability of substrate, and the underlying mechanism needs further research.

# 4.3Implications of the gross rates of N transformations and $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emission pathways

The sandy loam and silt loam soils selected for this study are typical for local agriculture in the western region of the Heilongjiang Province, China. The significant differences in these two soil properties lead to different rates of gross $\mathrm { \bf N }$ transformations and ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions. Sandy loam soil had lower rates of gross $\mathbf { N }$ mineralization and immobilization than silt loam soil due to the relatively low C content, but the ratio of gross nitrification to ammonium immobilization rate was relatively high. This result suggests that mineral $\mathbf { N }$ produced from mineralization in sandy loam soil was low, therefore a large amount of $\mathrm { \bf N }$ fertilizer is needed to meet the nutrient requirements of crop growth. However, it is better to apply the $\mathbf { N }$ fertilizer at low intensity and high frequency to avoid $\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ leaching, considering the low capacity of the soil to preserve the available N. In addition, this study showed that nitrification was the dominant process for emitting ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ in both sandy loam soil and silt loam soil under aerobic conditions,and the contribution of nitrification to ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ emissions in sandy loam soil was higher than in silt loam soil. These results provide an improved understanding to identify the relative importance between the two processes through which $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ is produced in sandy loam and silt loam soils, which is valuable for improving the predictability of soil ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions, proposing ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ mitigation strategies and establishing a calculation model to inventory greenhouse gases. However, the results were obtained under laboratory incubation conditions, which are different from the environmental variables found at a field site. Caution should be taken when extrapolating the results to field conditions.

# 5Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that the soil type was an important factor influencing the gross N transformationsand $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissionsfrom agriculturalsoil. GrossNmineralization, immobilization, and nitrification rates were significantly lower in sandy loam soil than in silt loam soil, but the ratio of gross nitrification rate to $\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 } { } ^ { + }$ immobilization rate was much larger in sandy loam soil despite the ratio values were both higher than 1.OO in these two soils, suggesting that sandy loam soil had a relatively poor ability to supply and conserve the available N and was more vulnerable to ${ \bf N } { \bf O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ leaching compared to silt loam soil. The processes of nitrification and denitrification took place simultaneously under $60 \%$ WHC for the two soils, nitrification was the dominant source of ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ production and the contribution of nitrification to $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ emissions was higher in sandy loam soil than in silt loam soil. These differences in gross $\mathbf { N }$ transformation rates imply that the soil type needs to be taken into consideration when manipulating fertilizer applications,and data on the pathway producing ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } { \bf O }$ from different agricultural soils are valuable for proposing effective mitigation strategies and developing process-based models to reduce the uncertainties in estimating ${ \bf N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ emissions. However, caution should be taken because this study was conducted under laboratory incubation conditions, and further research needs to be investigated at the field scale to take more factors into consideration.
