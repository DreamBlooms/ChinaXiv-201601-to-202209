# Introduction

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) convert the chemical energy from fuel directly into electrical energy have attracted much attention due to its high electrical efficiency,environmental friendly,and fuel flexibility [1,2]. SOFCs include the type of planar and tubular.Recently, the planar type SOFCs become the development trend for the commercialization application because of its high power density and low production cost [3]. However,the planar SOFCs are divided into the electrolytesupported and anode-supported type [4]. The anode supported cells (AsCs) has higher powder density due to the thin electrolyte with the thickness of approximately $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ [5].

Though the tape casting and the co-sintering technology is a cost-effective technique for fabricating large-scale ceramic substrates and multilayered structures [6-1O],it is still difficult to acquire a flat anode-supported half-cell,especially for the large-size ASCs.During the fabricating process,the mismatch between the material properties of the anodesupport and the electrolyte causes the warpage of cells [11,12]. The different layers are already in strong tension and others in compression [13].These high residual stresses can result in the single cell more fragile during the stacking process.Although there has been reported thata large-scale cell withtheareaof $2 2 \mathrm { c m } \times 3 3 \mathrm { c m }$ wasused to study the internal reforming on ASCs [14].However，it is still necessary to research on the preparation of large-size flat anode-support fuel cells.

In this work,the tape-casting,co-sintering,two-step sintering，and screen printing technique have been used to fabricate the flatanode-supported planar SOFCs with the large size of $3 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } \times 3 0 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ .Here,the large-size Ni-8YSZ/8YSZ/ 8YSZ-LSM ASCs with the electrolyte thickness of $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ were successfully fabricated.In addition,their sintering properties, microstructures,mechanical strengths,and electrochemical properties were investigated systematically.

# Experimental

Thematerialof $8 \mathrm { \ m o l \% } \mathrm { Y } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ -stabilized $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { Z r O } } _ { 2 }$ (8YSZ) and NiO was purchased from Qingdao Terio Corporation of China and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. of China, respectively. The powder of $( \mathrm { L a } _ { 0 . 7 } \mathrm { S r } _ { 0 . 3 } ) _ { 0 . 9 8 } \mathrm { M n O } _ { 3 }$ (LSM) was prepared by the solid-liquid composite method[15].For the preparation of the anode-support slurry,the mixture of 2- butanone and ethanol with a volume ratio of 2:1,polyvinyl butyral (PVB) and dibutyl-phthalate (DBP) were used as the solvent,the binder and the plasticizer,respectively. Then the mixture of 8YSZ and NiO,solvent,binder and plasticizer with the ratio of 15:20:60:3:2 was ball milled for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to obtain the uniform slurry.For fabrication of the NiO-8YSZ/ 8YSZ half-cell, the size of $3 8 ~ \mathrm { c m } \times 3 8 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ anode-supports green tape were prepared by the conventional tape-casting method followed by multilayer lamination.The active anode layer with the thickness of $2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ and the electrolyte with the thickness of $1 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ were prepared successively with the spraying，co-sintering and two-step sintering method. The half-cells were sintered by the two-step sintering process at the temperature of $1 1 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and $1 3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,respectively.

To study the pyrolysis behavior and the phase evolution of the anode support green tapes dried at $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ,TG-DTA analysis was carried out with heating velocity of $5 \mathrm { ~ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { ~ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ in air. For studying the sintering behaviors of the anode-support green tape,the $5 \mathrm { c m } \times 5$ cm samples were prepared with the same method,and then sintered at the different temperatures.The shrinkage rates of the half cells were measured by equation (1) with the formulaas follows:

$$
s \mathrm { h r i n k a g e } ( \% ) = \frac { \mathrm { l } _ { 0 } - \mathrm { l } _ { 1 } } { \mathrm { l } _ { 0 } } \times 1 0 0 \%
$$

where $\mathrm { l } _ { 0 }$ and $\mathrm { l } _ { 1 }$ are the lengths of the tape-cast green tapes and sintered half cells,respectively.For studying the flexural strength， thehalfcellswith the dimensionsof $4 \ : \mathrm { m m } \times 1 . 4 \ : \mathrm { m m } \times 3 6 \ : \mathrm { m m }$ were also prepared with the same method mentioned before.For each sintered temperature,10 half-cell samples were selected and measured in a screwdriven universal testing machine (Instron4483,Instron,USA) with a span of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ,at the cross-head moving velocity of $0 . 3 \ \mathrm { m m \ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ .The flexural strength values were obtained from the maximum load,according to the standard recommendations (ASTM-C1161,1994).The microstructure of the single cell was observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM,Hitachi T-1000).

The cathode slurry was prepared by mixing the powders of LSM $( 5 0 \mathrm { \ w t . \% } )$ and 8YSZ $( 5 0 \mathrm { \ w t . \% } )$ in terpineol solvent by ball milling. The cathode slurry was printed on the side of electrolyte by the method of screen printing.After dryingat the temperature of $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ ,the single cells with the active areas of $6 2 5 \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ were sintered at the temperature of $1 0 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,and the thickness of the cathode was approximately $2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ：

Before the two-cell short stack performance tests, the NiO slurry and $\mathsf { A } \mathsf { g }$ paste were printed on the anode and cathode surface of the single cells for the current collection,respectively.The stack was reduced at $8 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and tested at temperature of $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ using the stainless steel 430 (SS430) as interconnect.Air and dry hydrogen were used as an oxidant and fuel,respectively.The two cells and stack performances were evaluated by the current-voltage $( \mathrm { I } { - } \mathrm { V } )$ and current-- power $( \mathtt { I } { - } \mathtt { P } )$ curves at the temperature of $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Lastly,the stack was successively discharged under constant current of 5Afor $3 1 6 \mathrm { h }$ and $3 0 \mathtt { A }$ for1161h at $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ：

# Results and discussion

The TG/DTA curves of the half-cell green tape,the shrinkage rates of the half cells,and the photographs of the sintered half-cells are presented in Fig.1.As can be seen in Fig.1a, the loss in weight of approximately $2 1 . 4 \%$ for the TG curve is due to the thermal decomposition of the binder and plasticizer in the green tape accompanied by the sharp exothermic reaction in DTA curve. The exothermic peaks are approximately 380 and $4 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ 、With an increase of temperature,no further changes in weight and heat are detected,indicating that the half-cell is in relatively stable state.The shrinkage rates of the half cells sintered at different temperature are showed in Fig.1b.The shrinkage rates at the temperature from 100 to $9 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ are very small (less than $2 \%$ ),andincreasingrapidly from $2 \%$ to $2 0 . 5 \%$ from $9 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 3 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，then increasing slowly to $2 1 . 4 \%$ .The photos of the samples sintered at different temperatures show in Fig. 1c are also further confirmed the sintering process.It is the carbide and combustion process of the binder and plasticizer before the temperature of $5 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，and then the sintering process of the NiO-8YSZ composite ceramic material from 900 to $1 4 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Thus the two temperature range of 300-500 $^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $9 0 0 { - } 1 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf C }$ are very important to fabricate anode-supported half-cells due to the combustion and sintering process.In addition,thermal behavior of the sample was characterized bya NETZSCH DIL 402C pushrod dilatometer from room temperature to $1 4 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ witha heatingrate of $3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ .From the Fig.1d, the analysis of the shrinkage rate curves of the sample pre-sintered at $1 1 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ revealed that the densification at the temperature of approximately $1 1 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and the maximum shrinkage rate was achieved at the temperature of $1 2 2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$

Samples for the open porosity testing were also prepared with the same method,then sintered in air at different temperature for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ and half of the specimens were reduced in $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ at $8 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .The open porosities of unreduced and reduced samples test with the Archimedes method are shown in Fig.2. It is shown that the porosity of the unreduced and reduced samples decreasing from $20 \%$ and $3 6 . 8 \%$ to $8 . 6 \%$ and $2 4 . 3 \%$ ，under the sintering temperature from $1 2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 4 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,respectively.From the Fig.2, the porosity of unreduced and reduced half-cellis both decreased rapidlyafter the sintering temperature of $1 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .The flexural strength of the half-cells as a function of the sintering temperature is also shownin Fig.2.It can be seen that the flexural strength of the half-cell increases from 186 MPa to $2 8 3 ~ \mathrm { M P a }$ under the sintering temperature from $1 2 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 4 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .The flexural strength of the samples sintered at $1 3 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 4 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ are 265 MPa and $2 8 3 ~ \mathrm { \textmu { P a } }$ ，which is much higher that of the samples sintered at the same temperature in the references [24-26]. Therefore, the co-sintering temperature of $1 3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is more suitable for the fabrication of NiO-8YSZ/8YSZ anode support half-cells.

The sintering process of the half-cell, the photo and SEM micrographs of the anode-support single cell sintered at $1 3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,and the photo graph of the two-cell stack are shown in the Fig.3. The two-step sintering method was used to fabricate the anode-support half-cells,and the sintering curves were shown in Fig.3a.During the first sintering stage, the temperature rate is $3 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ from $3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $1 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the purpose of the completely combustion of organic additive and partial sintering of ceramic particles,and then keeps the temperature of $1 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .During the second sintering stage,the sintered cover plate was used.And the temperature rateis $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C h } ^ { - 1 }$ from room-temperature to $1 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ,thenwith the rate of $3 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \ \mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ from $1 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $1 3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and keeps the temperatureof $1 3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ .The flat NiO-8YSZ/8YSZ halfcells for planar ASCs with the large size of $3 0 \mathrm { c m } \times 3 0 \mathrm { c m }$ were successfully by the process of tape-casting,co-sintering,and two-step sintering.While the half-cell fabricated by the onestep sintering process was bending seriously.It is difficult to evaluate the flatness of the cell with irregular warpage showed in Fig.3b.Fig.3c and d shows the SEM micrographs of the large-size half-cell co-sintered at $1 3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ .The thickness of the 8YSZ electrolyte andactiveanode layerare around $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and $2 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ,respectively,and the 8YSZ electrolyte is dense.The area ofNiO-8YSZ/8YSZ/LSM-8YSZ full cell is $3 0 \times 3 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ ,and the active area of the cathode is $2 5 \times 2 5 \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ (show in Fig. 3e). Fig.3f shows the photograph of the two-cell short stack with the large size ASCs using the stainless steel 430 (SS430) as interconnect.

Fig.4 shows the I-V,I-P,and aging curves of the two-cell stack tested at the temperature of $7 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with the active electrode area of $6 2 5 \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ flow of 5000 sccm.In this work,the SS430 testing device was used to test the electrochemical properties of the cells and stack.It is well known that the resistance of stainless steel leads of the testing device is much higher than that of Pt or Agplate/mesh,especially at the high temperature.So the output voltage of cells and stack is occupied by the steel leads of the external circuit,and the maximum power cannot be obtained when the testing current becomes larger.From the Fig.4a,It can be seen that the open current voltage (OcV) of the two cells and short stack reach 1.123 V,1.186V and $2 . 3 0 9 \mathrm { V }$ ,respectively.It means that the 8YSZ electrolyte layer was dense without significant gas cross over,and the performance of the sealing components was excellent [16,17]. It also shows that the maximum measurement power $( \mathtt { P } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } } )$ of the two cells and short stack reach 32.6 W, 34.7 W and $6 7 . 3 { \mathrm { ~ W } }$ at the discharge current of $4 1 . 2 \mathrm { A }$ respectively.Fig. 4b shows the aging curves of the two-cell stack with the large size ASCs for $3 1 6 \mathrm { h }$ ata constant current of 5Aand 1161 h at a constant current of $3 0 \mathsf { A }$ ,respectively.In order to fullyactivate the cells,alow current of 5Awas used to agefor $3 1 6 \mathrm { h }$ .The output voltage of the cells and short stack slightlydecreasesfrom 0.989V to 0.985V,1.011V to $1 . 0 0 5 \mathrm { V }$ and $2 . 0 0 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ to $1 . 9 9 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ after $3 1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，corresponding to the degradation rate of $1 . 2 8 \% \mathrm { k h } ^ { - 1 }$ ， $1 . 8 8 \% \mathrm { k h } ^ { - 1 }$ ,and $1 . 5 8 \% \mathrm { k h } ^ { - 1 }$ respectively.The Cr element diffused into the electrode under the high temperature,which maybe the degradation mechanism of the cells and stack during the long-term discharging [18,19]. In addition,the high temperature corrosion of stainless steel test-house is likely to be another reason for cell performance degradation,which can lead to significantly in creases in resistance of the cell [2O,21]. Then the stack was aged at a constant current of 30 A for1161 h.From the Fig.4b, it can be seen that there is no degradation on the cells and the short stack during the second constant current discharging. This may be because of the better contact between interconnect and cells during the aging process,or the entirely reduction of the NiO in anode [22,23] due to the very large size which lead the $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ flow diffcult to uniformly distribute in the cells.This indicates that planar ASCs with a large area of $3 0 \ \mathrm { c m } \times 3 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ can operate at $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with a low degradation rate.

# Conclusions

In this study,the flat NiO-8YSZ/8YSZ half-cells for planar ASCs with the large size of $3 0 \ \mathrm { c m } \times 3 0 \ \mathrm { c m }$ were obtained by optimizing both the sintering characteristics and the sintering temperature of green-tapes.By optimizing the sintering process,the large size half-cells were prepared with the tapecasting，co-sintering，and two-step sintering method at $1 3 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ .The thickness of the 8YSZ electrolyte and the active anode layer are about $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ and $2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ ,respectively, and the 8YSZ electrolyte is dense.Then,the flexural strength and porosity of the half-cells were investigated in detail.After that, the $\mathrm { N i O + 8 Y S Z / 8 Y S Z / L S M + 8 Y S Z }$ anode-supported single cells were prepared at the sintering temperature of $1 0 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ And the maximum measurement power at output voltage of $0 . 8 \mathrm { V }$ of the two cells and $1 . 6 \mathrm { V }$ of the stack could reach $3 2 . 6 \mathrm { W }$ $3 4 . 7 ~ \mathrm { W }$ and $6 7 . 3 ~ \mathrm { W }$ ,respectively.Lastly,the two-cells stack was successively dischargedunder constant current of5A for $3 1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ with the degradation rate of $1 . 5 8 \% \mathrm { k h } ^ { - 1 }$ and 30 A for 1161 h with no degradation at the temperature of $7 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The results indicated that the large size NiO-8YSZ/8YSZ/8YSZLSM anode supported single cells showed the good mechanical strength and low degradation rate.To the best of our knowledge,so large anode supported single cells are firstly reported,and this work is expected to open a new pathway to prepare the large size anode supported single cells for the commercial application.
