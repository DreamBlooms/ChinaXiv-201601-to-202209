Conclusion: Functional analysis of the insertional mutants supports the recent structural models of HIV-1 Env.   
Significance: GFP insertion simultaneously achieves structural probing and generation of GFP-tagged Env.

The mature human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) comprises the non-covalentlyassociated $\mathbf { g } \mathbf { p } \mathbf { 1 } 2 \mathbf { 0 }$ and $\mathbf { g } \mathbf { p } 4 \mathbf { 1 }$ subunits generated from the $\mathbf { g } \mathbf { p } \mathbf { 1 6 0 }$ precursor.Recent structural analyses have provided quaternary structural models for $\bf { g } \bf { p } 1 2 0 / \bf { g } \mathrm { p } 4 1$ trimers,including the variable loops(V1-V5) of $\mathbf { g } \mathbf { p } 1 2 \mathbf { 0 }$ .In these models, the V3 loop is located under $\mathbf { V 1 } / \mathbf { V 2 }$ at the apical center of the Env trimer, and the V4 and V5 loops project outward from the trimeric protomers.In addition, the V4 and V5 loops are predicted to have less movement upon receptor binding during membrane fusion events.We performed insertional mutagenesis usinga GFP variant, $\mathbf { G F P _ { O P T } } ,$ placed into the variable loops of $\mathbf { H X B 2 \ g p { 1 2 0 } }$ This allowed us to evaluate the current structural models and to simultaneously generate a GFP-tagged HIV-1 Env,which was useful for image analyses.All GFP-inserted mutants showed similar levels of whole-cell expression，although certain mutants,particularly V3 mutants,showed lowerlevelsof cell surface expression.Functional evaluation of their fusogenicities in cell-cell and virus-like particle-cell fusion assays revealed that V3was the most sensitive to the insertion and that the V1/V2 loops were less sensitive than V3.The V4 and V5 loops were the most tolerant to insertion,and certain tag proteins other than $\mathbf { G F P _ { O P T } }$ could also be inserted without functional consequences.Our results support the current structural models and provide a $\mathbf { G F P _ { O P T } }$ -tagged Env construct for imaging studies.

The envelope glycoprotein $( \mathrm { E n v } ) ^ { 2 }$ of HIV-1 is an essential structural protein responsible for viral attachment and membrane fusion.Env is translated as the gpl6O precursor glycopro tein and is proteolytically processed into $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ and $\mathrm { g p 4 1 }$ by cellular furin or furin-like proteases within the Golgi apparatus (1) (see Fig.1A).The gpl20 subunit serves as a receptor-binding domain,and the gp4l subunit mediates membrane fusion. The $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ subunit is believed to dissociate from $\mathrm { g p 4 1 }$ during membrane fusion (gpl20 shedding).

The gpl20 domain contains five variable loops (V1-V5) that exhibit considerable sequence heterogeneity.The V1 and V2 loops demonstrate length and sequence variation among different strains as well as among quasispecies developing in the same individual during disease progression (2, 3). The V3 loop harbors a major co-receptor-binding site.The functions of the V4 and V5 loops are not well established; however,deletion of either loop exposes epitopes in $\mathrm { g p 4 1 }$ (4).The deletion of any variable loop in gpl2O abolishes viral entry $( 4 , 5 )$ ,although short peptide sequences such as FLAG,HA,and Myc can replace the sequence of the V1,V2,or V4 loop $( 6 - 8 )$ or can be inserted into the V1,V4,or V5 loop without loss of infectivity (9-11).These observations indicate that the variable loops of $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ are more tolerant to insertions than to deletions.

Recent advances in structural studies of HIV-1 Env have revealed the quaternary structures of trimeric gpl40 in a prefusion state with relatively high resolution $( 3 . 5 { - } 5 . 8 \mathrm { ~ \AA } )$ (12-14). The $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ subunits surround the core structure formed by three protomers of gp41 (see Fig.1B).Most of the variable loops except for V4 and part of V2 were resolved in these structures. The V1/V2/V3 loops associate together and stabilize the trimer apex.The V3 loop is located beneath the V1/V2 loop.The V4 and V5 loops are exposed at the exterior side of each protomer (see Fig.1B).Upon receptor binding, the Env structure is predicted to shift from this“closed"state to an“open"form(15, 16),involving a major shift of V1/V2 to expose V3 epitopes.In contrast,movement of the V4 and V5 loops is expected to be minimal.

# GFP Insertion into the Variable Loops of HiV-1 Env

To verify current structural models,we performed insertional mutagenesis within the gpl2O subunit.We reasoned that insertion of a protein rather than a peptide would be more informative because it produces a more drastic structural disturbance (17).We chose the GFP variant, $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ (230 amino acids; $2 6 \mathrm { k D a }$ )(18),as the insertion protein. $\mathrm { G F P _ { O P T } }$ isa derivative of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) (19),and we have successfully used it as a structural probe in a previous study (20). $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion mutagenesis not only provides structural insights regarding the gpl20 subunit itself but also generates a $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } ^ { - } }$ tagged $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ subunit that could be useful for the dynamic imaging of HIV-1 Env,which is difficult to accomplish with standard immunofluorescence staining methods.

In the current study,we evaluated the effects of the insertion of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ or other tag proteins into $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ variable loops on the expression, intracellular distribution, processing,and fusogenicity of this subunit.We found that $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ was one of several proteins suited for use as an insertional tag among those tested. The V4 and V5 loops were more tolerant of the insertion,and $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion therein could be used for image analyses.

# Experimental Procedures

Plasmids and Reagents-We used the pCMVand pHIV vectors as plasmid backbones.The pCMV vector was based on phRL-CMV (Promega,Madison，WI) and was used for the expression of the Env mutants destined for insertion or C-terminal tagging. The amino acid sequence of HIV-1 Env was derived from that of HXB2 (UniProt P04578).The pHIV vector was based on pEGFP-1(Takara Bio,Clontech) and used for the expression of Gag-Pol and Vpr.The gag-pol and vpr genes of HIV-1 HXB2 (Gag-Pol, UniProt accession number P04591 and GenBankTM accession number AAC82598; Vpr, NCBI accession number NP_057852) were codon-optimized for mammalian expression (Taihe Biotechnology,Beijing, China).

$\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ represents the full-length GFP variant originally optimized for generating split GFP (18). ${ \mathrm { P A - G F P } } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ was generated byintroducing three mutations (L64F,T65S,and T203H (21)) into $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ .Clover (22) was from Addgene (Cambridge, MA).When EGFP and mCherry (23) were inserted into Env, their C termini were shortened at Thr-231 and Thr-228, respectively. Clover-GIT was generated by adding the GIT amino acid sequence to the Clover C terminus to yield the same C-terminal sequence as that of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } } .$ The HaloTag was from Promega.Insertion,deletion，and site-directed mutagenesis procedures were mainly performed using the QuikChange method(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Insertion of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ into Env was performed as described previously (20). For C-terminal $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } } .$ tagging, Sall-XbaI sites were first added to the $\mathsf { g p 4 1 C }$ terminus followed by the insertion of the $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ gene.

For BlaM assays,we generated several constructs encoding the $\beta$ -lactamase-Vpr fusion protein that we designated AmpR, $\mathrm { B l a } _ { \mathrm { O P T } } .$ ,and W1o3Y.The AmpR sequence was identical to the $\beta$ -lactamase used in the original BlaM assay (24). $\mathrm { \Delta B l a } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ was codon-optimized for human expression and contained seven mutations,sixofwhich (A40G,G90S,E102K,M180T,G236S, and R238H) conferred a 32,ooo-fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration against cefotaxime compared with wild-type TEM-1 (25). The seventh mutation (Y103W) conferred a1.5-fold increase in the $k _ { \mathrm { { c a t } } } / K _ { m }$ for cefazolin, the $\beta$ -lactam most closely related to CCF2-AM (26,27).W103Y was based on $\mathrm { \Delta B l a } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ with reversion of the Y103W mutation.These mutants were connected to the $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ or C terminus of $\mathrm { V p r }$ via an $\mathrm { S G } _ { 4 }$ linker.Overall,we generated five $\beta$ -lactamase constructs: AmpR-Vpr (C-terminal Vpr),Vpr-AmpR (N-terminal Vpr), $\mathrm { B l a } _ { \mathrm { O P T } } – \mathrm { V p r }$ ,Vpr-BlaoPT, and W103Y-Vpr.

The peroxisomal marker was generated by inserting a peroxisome-targeting signal (Ser-Lys-Leu） in the C terminus of mKate2 (Evrogen,Moscow,Russia).The subcellularmarkers for clathrin light chain (28),Rab5 (29),Rab7 (30),Rab11 (30), and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) (31) were from Addgene.The fluorescent proteins of the markers for Rab7,Rab11,and LAMP-1 were replaced with mCherry.

Cells and Transfections-We grew the 293FT (Thermo Fisher Scientific,Life Technologies，Invitrogen)，293MSR (Invitrogen)，293CD4 (293 cells constitutively expressing human CD4) (32),HeLa L132,and MAGI (HeLa cells expressing human CD4) (33) cell lines in DMEM(Corning Cellgro, Cambridge,MA） supplemented with $1 0 \%$ （204 $\left( \mathbf { v } / \mathbf { v } \right)$ FBS(Thermo Fisher Scientific,Hyclone) and penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Life Technologies,Gibco) at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in $5 \%$ （204号 $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ .Weused Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and FuGENE HD (Promega) for transient transfections.

Indirect Immunofluorescence Assays-Cells were grown in wells of a clear bottom 96-well Matriplate with $0 . 1 7 \mathrm { - m m }$ -thick glass (Brooks Life Science Systems, Spokane,WA) and fixed in $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde.Cells were permeabilized with $0 . 5 \%$ Triton X-1oo.Fixed cells were blocked with $2 \%$ BSA in PBS for 30 min and incubated with a human anti-gpl20 monoclonal antibody (clone 2G12; Polymun Scientific GmbH,Klosterneuburg, Austria) followed by incubation with an Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific，Life Technologies,Molecular Probes).Fluorescence was observed usingan IX71 fluorescence microscope (Olympus,Tokyo,Japan) equipped with a Retiga2000R cooled monochrome 12-bit charge-coupled device camera(QImaging,Surrey,British Columbia,Canada).

Cell-based ELISA (CELISA)-293MSR cells $( 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ cells) wereplated in 96-well ViewPlates (PerkinElmerLife Sciences). The next day，cells were co-transfected with Env and $\mathrm { R L - D S P } _ { \mathrm { 1 - 7 } }$ (20) expression plasmids.Alternately,HeLa cells $( 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ cells) were plated in a 96-well plate and transfected with an Env expression plasmid of interest ora variant thereof. After $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ of transfection,cells were fixed in $4 \%$ paraformaldehyde and treated with $3 \%$ hydrogen peroxide in PBS ( $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 \mathrm { m i n } \rangle$ to deactivate endogenous peroxidases.Fixed cells were incubated with $2 \%$ ECLPrime Blocking Reagent (GE Healthcare)in PBSat $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .Todetermine thewhole-cell expression levels,cells were permeabilized by the addition of $0 . 5 \%$ Triton X-1oO to the blocking buffer.After blocking, cells were incubated with a saturating amount of 2G12 $( 1 3 . 1 \mu \mathrm { g / m l } )$ at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { \textrm { 1 h } }$ and then incubated with anti-human IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,Dallas,TX) at $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { \textrm { 1 h } }$ Antibodies were diluted in $0 . 2 \%$ ECL Prime Blocking Reagent. Luminescence was detected using the ECL Prime Western

Blotting Detection Reagent(GE Healthcare) and a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega).Before calculation of the relative expression levels,the averaged background signal from Env-untransfected cells was subtracted from the readings.

Cell-Cell Fusion Assays-To quantitatively evaluate cell-cell fusion activity,a dual split protein (DSP) assay was performed as described previously (20,34,35).Briefly,293MSR cells were co-transfected with Env (WT, $2 2 { \mathrm { n g } } i$ mutants, $5 0 \mathrm { n g }$ plus $5 0 \mathrm { n g }$ of RL- ${ \cdot \mathrm { D S P } _ { 1 - 7 } }$ plasmids per well and co-cultured with 293CD4 cells constitutively expressing Rl $\mathrm { - D S P _ { 8 - 1 1 } }$ in the presence of EnduRen (Promega).Based on our pilot experiment， the amount of WTDNA used for transfections was reduced to that used for the mutant constructs to avoid saturation of the DSP assay.Cell-cell fusion was continuously monitored as Renilla luciferase (RL) activity witha GloMax-MultiDetection System (Promega) after co-culturing at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ Therelative fusion activities were calculated based on the RL activity at $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ after the averaged background signals from Env-untransfected cells were subtracted from the readings.

After centrifugation $( 2 0 , 4 0 0 \times g , 3 0 \operatorname* { m i n } , 4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ,the supernatant was collected,and the total protein concentration was determined with a BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein samples $( 2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } )$ were electrophoresed by SDSPAGE (XV Pantera MP gel, DRC CO., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with PageRulerPrestained ProteinLadder(Thermo Scientific).Proteins were then passively transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-PSQ,Merck Millipore,Billerica,MA).Polyclonal goat anti-gpl20(1:30oo; Fitzgerald,Acton,MA),monoclonal mouse anti-gp41 (1:500;Chessie8 (36))，monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (1:50oO; clone B-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)，and monoclonal rabbit anti-GAPDH(1:5000;clone D16H11; Cell Signaling Technology,Danvers,MA) antibodieswereused as primaryantibodies.Bovine anti-goat IgG-HRP(1:25,ooo; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies)，goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:50,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),and donkey anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:50,ooo; GE Healthcare) were used as secondary antibodies. Reactive bands were visualized using an eECL Western Blot kit (CWBIO, Beijing, China) and an LAS30o0 luminescence image analyzer(Fujifilm，Tokyo,Japan).ImageJ (37） software was usedto quantifytheband intensities.

Production of Virus-like Particles (VLPs)-For VLP-cell fusion assays,HIV-1 VLPs were produced by transfecting 293FT cells with pCMV/Env, pHIV/Gag-Pol,and pHIV/Vpr$\beta$ -lactamase using molar ratios of 2.2:1:1.After transfection for ${ \sim } 4 8 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,cell debris was removed from the supernatant by centrifugation ( $2 0 0 0 \times g ,$ 10 min)and filtration $( 0 . 4 5 \mathrm { - } \mu \mathrm { m }$ syringe filter).The amount of VLPs was quantified usinga RETROtek HIV-1 p24 Antigen ELISA kit (ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY).

VLP-Cell Fusion Assays (BlaM Assay)-MAGI cells( $( 1 . 5 \times$ $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ cells) were plated in 96-well ViewPlates 1 day before the BlaM assay.VLPs( $\cdot 5 { \mathrm { ~ n g } }$ of p24) were added to MAGI cells, spinoculated $( 1 5 8 0 \times g , 3 0 \mathrm { m i n } , 1 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ ,and incubated at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $9 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ to enable virus entry.The medium was then replaced with cold medium containing CCF4-AM loading solution (LiveBLAzer FRET-B/G Loading kit, Invitrogen). Plates were incubated at $1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 1 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ or at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ overnight. Fluorescence was observed by imaging cytometry using an IN Cell Analyzer 1000(GE Healthcare) with a $4 \times$ objective lens,dichroic mirror (425DCXR),excitation filter $\mathrm { ( H Q 4 0 5 / 2 0 \times ) }$ ,and emission filters $\mathrm { ( H Q 4 6 0 / 4 0 ~ M }$ and HQ535/50M).The exposure time for blue and green fluorescence was $5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ .We observed four fields of view for each well.Data were analyzed using the IN Cell Investigator (GE Healthcare).The signals within the cells were detected using the“object segmentation" module with a setting of kernel size $= 7$ where pixels with higher intensities than those in the surrounding $7 \times 7$ -pixel unit were detected. The sensitivity value was set to 5O at which the blue signal was almost absent in the mock well. Background noise signals of less than $5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ were removed. These operations allowed us to detect the cytoplasmic fluorescence signals.The fluorescence levels were then calculated as the total fluorescence intensity in each field and separately for blue and green fluorescence.The fluorescence intensities from the four fields were averaged to compare the signal of each well. The blue:green fluorescence ratio for each mutant was calculated as the VLP-cell fusion activitycomparedwith that of the WT,whichwas set to $100 \%$

Particle Counting-Intracellular particles of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -inserted Env in fixed HeLa cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy and counted using ImageJ (37） software.The particles were detected using the Find Maxima program as local maxima within the surrounding pixels above a threshold determined by the“noise tolerance"value of 3oo.The resultant binary image was furtheranalyzed by the Analyze Particles program with a circularity of $0 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0$ to count the circular particles.

The optical and acquired resolutions were $1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and $6 2 \ \mathrm { n m } ,$ /pixel,respectively,under our experimental conditions.Images were analyzed using ImageJ software with a manually developed macro. Vesicles were detected using the Find Maxima program with a noise tolerance value of ${ \sim } 8 0 0$ .After closing holes in the binary image,the Analyze Particles program was run with a circularity of $0 . 7 \mathrm { - } 1 . 0$ against the objects consisting of more than two pixels to remove noise.The resultant binary images in each channel were merged,and overlapping pixels were extracted.To count the number of colocalized vesicles,the Analyze Particles programwas run against pixel overlaps consisting of more than four pixels to remove the marginally overlapped vesicles from the total counts.

Evaluation of $G F P _ { O P T ^ { - } } E n \nu$ Using a Cell-Cell Fusion Assay andWestern Blotting-The fusogenicity of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -Env was evaluated using the DSP assay (20,34) (Fig.3B). The V1.2, V2.4, V4.1,and V4.2 mutants retained more than $60 \%$ fusogenicity of the WT Env. V1.3 and V4.3 showed less than $45 \%$ fusogenicity, whereasV1.1,V2.1,V2.2,V2.3,V3.1,V3.2,andV3.3lost fusogenicity entirely.After normalization using cell surface Envlevels, the V5 and $\mathrm { g p 4 1 }$ mutants were revealed to have cell-cell fusogenicity similar to that of the WT (Fig. 3B).

We selected the highly fusogenic mutants (V1.2,V2.4, V4.1, V5.3,gp41-GFP1,and $\mathrm { \ g p { 4 1 } }$ -GFP2)anda fusion-incompetent mutant (V3.2) to examine the effects of insertion of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ on the processing of gpl60 and gpl20 shedding by Western blotting (Fig.4A).The V3.2,gp41-GFP1，and $\mathrm { \ g p 4 1 }$ -GFP2 constructs showed decreased processing (Fig. 4A, $\mathrm { g p 4 1 / g p 1 6 0 } _ { \cdot }$ compared with the WT.Low amounts of gp120 (Fig.4A,gp120/ gp160) in V3.2,gp41-GFP1,and gp41-GFP2 compared with their $\mathrm { g p 4 1 / g p 1 6 0 }$ values suggested that these constructs had enhanced gpl20 shedding.In particular,gpl20 was hardly observed in V3.2. TheV1.2,V2.4,V4.1,and V5.3 constructs exhibited levels of processing similar to that seen in the WT.

The shedding of gpl20 was further analyzed by immunoprecipitation of the shed gpl2O from culture supernatants (Fig.

$\left. 4 B \right.$ ).The band shift following PNGase F treatment indicated that all shed gp120 contained $N \mathrm { . }$ -glycosylations regardless of the $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion.In V3.2,in addition to a faint band around $1 5 0 \mathrm { k D a }$ ,most of the shed $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ migrated as a thick band with an apparent molecular mass of $8 0 \mathrm { k D a }$ (Fig. 4B,lane 5).After deglycosylation,two bands of ${ \sim } 3 2$ and $5 5 \mathrm { k D a }$ were observed in addition to the full-length $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0 + \mathrm { G F P }$ band at around 100 kDa (Fig. 4B,lane 13). The upper 55-kDa band was recognized by the anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 29). Because cleavage around the V3 crown has been reported previously (38-41), the thick 80-kDa band in the V3.2 lane was interpreted to be a mixture of the cleaved gpl20 products with the expected sizes of 77 (N-terminal fragment) and $8 2 \mathrm { k D a }$ (C-terminal fragment with GFP),respectively.These mixtures were resolved into 32 (N-terminal fragment) and $5 5 \mathrm { k D a }$ (C-terminal fragment with GFP） after deglycosylation (Fig. $\begin{array} { r } { 4 B _ { ; } } \end{array}$ ，lanes 13 and 29).From these results,it appeared that $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion into the V3 loop enhanced the proteolytic cleavage around the GPGR crown prior or subsequent to $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ shedding.A similar phe nomenon was also observed forV1.2 and V2.4(Fig.4B,lanes 19, 20,27,and 28).The fact that V3.2 had a very low association index clearly indicated that V3.2 showed enhanced gp120 shedding (Fig. 4B).

VLP-Cell Fusogenicity of $G F P _ { O P T ^ { - } } E n \nu$ -Because the efficien cies of cell-cell and virus-cell fusions can be different (42),we examined the fusogenicities of VLPs bearing $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -Env using the BlaM assay (24) (Fig.5).The BlaM assay uses a virion-incorporated $\beta$ -lactamase as a virus entry reporter (Fig.5A).We improved the sensitivity of the BlaMassay by testing several $\beta$ -lactamase-Vpr fusion proteins (Fig. 5B). The $\mathrm { B l a } _ { \mathrm { O P T } } { - } \mathrm { V p r }$ construct had the highest activity and was used in subsequent experiments.

Compared with the WTEnv, the VLP-cell fusionactivities of V4.1,V4.2,V5.2,and V5.3 were more than $60 \%$ ,whereas those of V1.2, V2.4, V4.3,V5.1,gp41-GFP1,and gp41-GFP2 were less than $5 5 \%$ (Fig.5C).The V1.3 and V3.2 constructs lost their

VLP-cell fusion activity entirely. Comparing normalized cellcell fusion activity according to cell surface expression levels (Fig. 3B),V1.3,V4.3, V5.1,gp41-GFP1,and gp41-GFP2 showed over $40 \%$ decreases in their relative VLP-cell fusion activities (Fig.5C).In contrast, the V4.1,V4.2,V5.2,and V5.3 constructs generated good fusogenicity in both cell-cell and VLP-cell fusion assays.

To examine the stability of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -Env on VLPs,we performed VLP-cell fusion assays using VLPs with prolonged storage (Fig. $5 D$ ).VLP samples stored at $4 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 7 and $5 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ were compared.VLP-cell fusion activities of all V1 and V2 mutants were dramatically decreased by prolonged storage. Therefore, $\mathrm { G F P _ { O P T } }$ -insertion into the V1/V2 loop likely induced structural instability.

ToleranceoftheV1,V4,andV5LoopsforInsertionofForeign Proteins-The tolerance of identified sites in the V1,V4,and V5 loops for the insertion of proteins other than $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ was examined in cell-cellfusion assays (Fig.6).Several proteins that might be useful for image analysis were chosen for insertion.These represent GFP derivatives (EGFP;Clover,a bright variant of GFP (22); sfGFP (19); and P $\mathrm { A - G F P _ { O P T } }$ ，a photoactivatable (PA)version of $\mathrm { G F P _ { O P T } } ,$ )；ared fluorescent protein (RFP) derivative (mCherry)；a photoconvertible fluorescent protein (mEos3.1,the latest variant for super-resolution microscopy (43)); and a multipurpose tag protein (HaloTag),which can be labeled with fluorescent ligands.

Env proteins with sfGFP,PA- ${ \bf \cdot G F P _ { O P T } }$ ,mCherry,orHaloTag inserted into the V5 loop showed more than $60 \%$ fusogenicity (Fig. 6B). Clover-, sfGFP-, PA $J _ { \cdot } \mathrm { { G F P } _ { \mathrm { { O P T } } ^ { - } } }$ , mCherry-,or HaloTag

Envinsertions into the V4.1 or V5.3 sites exhibited near WT activity after normalization,suggesting that these sites were good targets for insertion.However,Env proteins with EGFP or mEos3.1 insertion showed low fusogenicity even after normalization (Fig. 6B).

EvenamongGFP derivatives (Fig.6A),modified Env proteins exhibited different levels of fusogenicity.When we inserted the GFP derivatives into the less tolerant V1.2 site,only the Env with sfGFP had good fusogenicity(Fig. 6C) despite the fact all of the GFP derivatives had amino acid sequences similar to that of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ (Fig. 6A).Clover in particular shares $9 2 \%$ amino acid sequence identity with $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ .Extension of the C terminus of Clover(Clover-GIT) to generate the same C-terminal length as $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } } \left( \mathrm { F i g } . 6 A \right)$ did not significantly improve the fusogenicity of V1.2-Clover. Overall, the Env constructs with GFP variants with the exception of sfGFP showed less than $1 5 \%$ fusogenicity regardless of their high levels of cell surface expression (Fig.6C). It appears that subtle amino acid sequence differences within the inserted protein gives rise to different effects on Env functioning.

Application of $G F P _ { O P T }$ -EnvtotheExaminationofIntracellu larEnv Distribution-We examined whether the $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -Env can be applied to the analysis of intracellular distribution regulation by the cytoplasmic tail (CT).The lentiviral Env protein has a long CTat the C terminus of $\mathrm { g p 4 1 }$ (Fig.1A) that regulates intracellular trafficking and virion incorporation of Env (44, 45).A truncation mutant of the CT(△CT) was generated whose coding region stopped at the end of the transmembrane domain $( \mathrm { A r g } ^ { 7 0 7 }$ ; Fig. 7). Both the WT and V5.3 Env proteins containing $\Delta \mathrm { C T } \ \mathrm { g p 4 1 }$ showed high cell surface expression (Fig.7,A and $B$ ）

asreported previously (46) regardless of the similarityof their whole-cell expression levels to those of the full-length CT constructs.Fluorescence microscopy showed that most of the $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ signal from $\mathrm { V } 5 . 3$ was distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus (Fig.7C) as expected from the expression pathway of Env.Furthermore, $\mathrm { V } 5 . 3 \Delta \mathrm { C T }$ showed a high incidence of punctate expression(Fig.7C) in addition to this distribution pattern.The number of particles in $\mathrm { V } 5 . 3 \Delta \mathrm { C T }$ was significantly higher than that observed for V5.3(Fig. $7 D _ { , } ^ { ' }$ .A similar result was obtained for the R511S noncleavable mutant (47) (Fig. $7 D$ ),indicating that the appearance of these particles was independent of $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ shedding.

Colocalization analyses with subcellular markers were performed to explore the nature of these particles bearing $\mathrm { V } 5 . 3 \Delta \mathrm { C T }$ (Fig.8). Confocal microscopy showed that $\sim 3 0 \%$ of these particles colocalized with vesicles containing the markers Rab7 (late endosome) and LAMP-1 (lysosome), $\sim 1 0 \%$ were colocalized withRab5 (early endosome),and less than $6 \%$ were colocalized with peroxisome,clathrin lightchain (clathrin-coated vesicle),and Rab11 (recycling endosome) (Table 2).These results suggest that the majority of the observed particles in $\mathrm { V } 5 . 3 \Delta \mathrm { C T }$ are vesicles localized between the trans-Golgi network and lysosomes.

# Discussion

$G F P _ { O P T }$ Insertional Mutagenesisto ProbeProtein StructureWe sought to examine structure-function relationships of the $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ variable loops by insertional mutagenesis using $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ . Consistent with current structural models， we found that the exteriorly located V4 and V5 loops are more tolerant to foreign protein insertion than are the V1/V2/V3 loops located near the trimer interface.

Considering that the V1/V2 loop contained regions exposed to the surface (Fig.1B),it was expected that $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion would be tolerated in these regions. Although all V1/V2 mutants were expressed on the cell surface similarly to the WT Env (Figs.3A and 6C),V1.1,V2.1,V2.2,and V2.3 were found to be fusion-incompetent.The majority of the V1/V2 loop forms $\beta$ -strands (12,14),and the insertion sites ofthe fusion-defective mutants identified in our study are within these $\beta$ -strands (Fig.3B). Thus, the $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion might disrupt or destabilize the $\beta$ -strands in these mutants.Even insertion outside of the $\beta$ -strand regions,however,into the closelyassociated V1/V2/V3 loops might induce structural instability (Fig. $5 D _ { , } ^ { \cdot }$ ).In addition to such potential local disturbances in the prefusion state, insertion of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ into the V1/V2 loop might possibly disturb the predicted global movement of this region upon receptor binding (15，16).Combinations of these local and global structural constraints might be the reason why the V1/V2 loop despite natural variation in its length and amino acid sequences has a low tolerance to the insertion of a large protein.

In terms of steric hindrance,the V4 and V5 loops are expected to be tolerant toward the insertion of foreign proteins because of their exterior location and their minimal predicted movement during membrane fusion.Indeed, the V4 and V5 loops were found to be well tolerant of foreign protein insertions (Figs.3,5,and6),and the resultant $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -Env exhibited good stability (Fig. $5 D _ { \prime } ^ { \prime }$ .Although one half of the V5 loop forms a $\beta$ -strand andonlyabout 5aminoacid residues formanactual loop(Fig.1B), this short loop region is well tolerant to insertion. Thus,our approach of using GFP rather than a small peptide as an insertion probe might provide a better assessment of global protein rearrangements.

The V3 loop showed no tolerance to insertion (Fig. 3B). Insertion of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ into the V3 loop might inhibit co-receptor binding or lead to steric hindrance,preventing the overlaying of the V1/V2 loop (Fig.1B). Consistent with the latter possibility, our Western blotting results showed that $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion into the V3 loop facilitated $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ shedding and V3 cleavage (Fig.4).However,it is unclear whether cleavage at V3 induced shedding or whether shed $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ was easily cleaved. This enhanced gpl20 shedding is likely the reason for the low cell surface expression of the V3 mutants (Fig.3A).

Labelingof gp120-Using $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertional mutagenesis, we successfully labeled HIV-1 Env within the $\mathrm { g p } 1 2 0$ domain. Although tagging at the $\mathtt { g p 4 1 C }$ terminus is possible, we cannot exclude the possibility that the attachment of an additional sequenceat the C terminus mightaffect its functionas has been shown in a previous report (48).In fact, our gp4l-GFP1 and gp41-GFP2 constructs showed decreased gpl60 processing (Fig.4)and lower VLP-cell fusion efficiency than did the V4 and V5 mutants (Fig. 5). Furthermore,gp41-labeled Env might include non-functional Env such as gpl20-depleted gp41 stumps (49). Therefore,a method for effectively labeling gp120 would be useful to avoid these problems.

Because we expected that $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -Env would be suitable for the analysis of $\mathrm { g p 4 1 }$ mutants based on the reasons listed above, the $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ -Env concept was applied to the analysis of the △CT mutant (Figs.7 and 8). As expected, $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ insertion had no effect on the high cell surface expression of △CT Env.It has been reported that the CThas many motifs for the regulation of intracellular trafficking (44,45),including possible Golgi retention or retrieval functions (5O).Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed vesicles might be artifacts arising from the overexpression of HXB-2 Env, the $\mathrm { V } 5 . 3 \Delta \mathrm { C T }$ construct clearly showed that an increased number of vesicles primarily reside in late endosomes and lysosomes.Our results appear to be consistent with the hypothesis that the overexpressed △CT mutant could not be transported back to the Golgi because of the lack of a Golgi retention/retrieval motif and thus was transferred to the degradation pathway instead.

InsertionProteinsforMutagenesisandLabeling-Basedon the results of our insertional mutagenesis study using different kinds of proteins,we reasoned that several factors are critical so that a protein can be suitably inserted but maintain the function of HIV-1 Env: the proximity of the $_ \mathrm { N }$ and C termini, folding efficiency,and size.The close proximity of the Nand C termini ofGFP ( $2 4 \textup { \AA }$ between the $_ \mathrm { N }$ and C termini; Protein Data Bank code 2YoG) may be preferable for insertion as suggested previously (2O).Most fluorescent proteins have a GFP-like $\beta$ -barrel structure with their N and C termini in close proximity.The HaloTag,which hasa different structural fold than that in GFP, also has relatively close $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ and C termini $( 3 1 \textup { \AA }$ ；ProteinData Bank code 4KAF).We found that these proteins can be inserted into Env with good retention of fusogenicity (Fig. 6). However, when we inserted Renillaluciferase,which possesses relatively distant termini (42 A; Protein Data Bank code 2PSD),into the V5.3 position,Env fusogenicity was disrupted (data not shown). Therefore,proximity of the $\mathrm { \Delta N }$ and C termini should be one criterion to be considered when choosing a protein for insertion.However, this should not be the only factor to be considered as insertion at the $\mathrm { V } 5 . 3$ site of EGFP or mEos3.1,which possess similar structural folds and close proximities of their N and C termini,resulted in Env proteins with considerablylower fusion competencies (Fig.6B).

Considering that $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ is derived from sfGFP (19),which demonstrates good folding efficiency,the folding eficiency of the inserted protein could be an important factor for maintaining Env fusogenicity.In fact,among the tested GFP variants, only $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ and sfGFP were able to maintain significant levels of fusogenicity when inserted into the V1.2 site (Figs.3B and 6C).This possibility is supported by a recent report showing that the function of the fluorescent protein-inserted herpes simplex virus $\mathrm { \ g B }$ protein was improved at $3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$ a temperature at which protein folding was also improved (17).

The size of the inserted protein should also be considered because translation of Env can be stalled during translation of the inserted protein.Fluorescent proteins have similar molecularmasses ( ${ \sim } 2 6 \ \mathrm { k D a } )$ and are smaller than the HaloTag (37 kDa).Although further reduction of the size of fluorescent proteins seems difficult,other smaller tag systems such as the biarsenical tetracysteine labeling system (51) are available for use. This system incorporates a 6-amino acid tetracysteine tag and has already been applied for the internal labeling of loops in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and gpl20 (10). However,only tagging in the gpl2o V1loop at the same site as was modified in our

V1.2 construct was capable of producing VLPs with $\sim 5 0 \%$ infectivity. The high level of background generated by the tetracysteine tag system is also problematic.

We cannot rule out the possibility of the existence of other factors critical for the suitable insertion of proteins into HIV-1 Env.Further studiesare needed to determinewhether factors such as the proximityofNand C termini,folding efficiency,and size of the protein are critical characteristics for other target proteins.Most of the phenotypes observed in our insertion mutants are consistent with the current structural models of trimeric Env,which validates the usefulness of mutagenesis using $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ as a probe. $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ appears to have optimal properties for insertional mutagenesis because of the close proximity of its $\mathrm { ~ N ~ }$ and C termini as well as an expected high folding efficiency.Because the insertion of $\mathrm { G F P } _ { \mathrm { O P T } }$ into the V4 or V5 loop effectively preserved the functions of HIV-1 Env, we expect that these mutants will bea useful tool in future HIV-1 research,especially for imagingapplications.
