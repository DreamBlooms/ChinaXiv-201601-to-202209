ABSTRACT:We used cesium stearate (CsSt) to modify the interface of the electronextracting contact in inverted organic solar cells. Surface microstructure， optical properties， and electrical characterization as well as exciton generation rate and dissociation probability were investigated to understand the impact of CsSt on the interface contact. The results indicated that by incorporation of CsSt， the surface morphology and energy level as well as conductivity of a zinc oxide $( \mathrm { Z n O } )$ film were improved. On the basis of the above properties, highly efficient inverted organic solar cells have been demonstrated by using a $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ nanoparticle film and CsSt stacked bilayer structureas the cathode interfacial layer.The insertion of a CsSt layer between the $\mathrm { z n O }$ film and active layer improved the electron extraction effciency，and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE)of $8 . 6 9 \%$ was achieved. The PCE was improved by $20 \%$ as comparedto thereference deviceusinga $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ -onlyelectron extraction layer.

# INTRODUCTION

Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ） organic solar cells(OSCs） have attracted tremendous interest for applications in renewable energy because of their advantages of being low cost and lightweight and having easy fabrication and the capability to fabricate flexible large-area devices.1-5 With the development of materials design and fabrication processes,the power conversion efficiency(PCE）of BHJ OSCs has been remarkably improved.6-10 Recently， great improvements have been achieved such as the certified PCE of $9 . 2 \%$ for singlejunction and $1 0 . 6 \%$ for tandem solar cells.1,12 Inaddition,a PCE of more than $8 \%$ _has also been reported in the small molecular solar cels.13-15 Interfacial layers, located between the photoactive layer and electrodes,can significantly improve the performance of OSCs.16-20Such interfacial layerscan be multifunctional materials that act as selective charge injection layers or modify electrodes,so that theycan block charges from recombinationat the active layer-electrode interfaces.21-23 However,the lack of understanding of interface modification and impact of surface properties limit their further specification anddevelopment24Tereforedevelopingeadmoe effective interfacial layers and investigating the interfacial property are vital for enhancing solar cell performance.

A thin film of n-type semiconducting zinc oxide $( \mathrm { Z n O } )$ nanoparticles is commonly used as an effective electron extraction layer in inverted OSCs owing to its high electron mobility and optical transparency，as well as its ease of processability7-29However,the major challenge inemploying $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ nanoparticle film as an electron extraction layer is the presence of defects on the surface.30 The surface defects allow the increased recombination of electrons and holes generated in the active layer.²7 In addition, sol-gel $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ as an alternative was also reported for the electron extraction layer.30-34 Sol-gel $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ films are formed by annealing zinc acetate at high temperature.Therefore,colloidal $\mathrm { z n O }$ nanoparticle film is the choice for electron extraction in OSCs due to its low temperature processing capability. Recently，a fullerene derivative,3 poly(ethylene glcol) (G)，28,36ojtd polyelectrolytes,7,37,38 or poly(ethylene oxide) (EO),39,4 was widely designed and prepared to optimize the contact between $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ and the active layer.However, the tedious synthesis and batch-to-batch variation of the polymer modifier might be the drawback for their application.In this sense,it is necessary to develop a $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ nanoparticle flm with low defects so as to further enhance the performance of inverted solar cells.

Cesium stearate (CsSt)，consisting of an inorganic metallic cation and a long aliphatic hydrocarbon chain,is thought to be a promising interface modification material. It possesses both the properties of inorganic and organic materials and is expected to exhibit better interfacial compatibilitiesand electronic properties.In this work, we employed CsSt as an interfacial modificationmaterial and studied the effectsof CsSt on the interface property and device performance in OSCs devices.The changes in surface microstructure and optical and electrical properties as well as exciton generation rate and dissociation probability were analyzed to investigate the mechanism of interfacial improvement.After incorporation of a thin CsSt layer onto the $\mathrm { { Z n O } }$ nanoparticle film, the surface traps of $\mathrm { { Z n O } }$ film were passivated,and the flm morphology was improved. The interface improvement gave a power conversion efficiency of $8 . 6 9 \%$ and significantly enhanced the performance of OSCs over that of a $\mathrm { z n O }$ -based device by $2 0 \%$ Such treatment can also prevent a direct contact of the active layerwith $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ andtherefore furtherreduce the recombination of electron and hole on the surface of $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ films.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The device architecture of inverted OSCs and the energy level diagram of materials are illustrated in Figure 1.The device consisted of $\mathrm { I T O / Z n O / C s S t }$ film/polymer active layer/ $\mathrm { M o O } _ { 3 } / \$ Al.For the photoactive layer materials，we used poly[[4,8- bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo- $[ 1 , 2 - \mathbf { b } ; 4 , 5 - \mathbf { b } ^ { \prime } ]$ dithiophene-2,6- diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]-thieno-[3,4-b]- thiophenediyl]] (PTB7）as the donor material and [6,6]- phenyl- $\mathrm { \cdot C } _ { 7 1 }$ -butyricacid methyl ester $\left( \mathrm { P C } _ { 7 1 } \mathrm { B M } \right)$ as the acceptor material. For comparison，the device with the $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ -only interfacial layer was also fabricated.

Figure 1.Schematic illustration of the inverted device architecture and the chemical structure and energy level of the materials used in the work.

To investigate the effect of CsSt on the surface morphology of interfacial layer,a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM） were employed，and the results are shown in Figure 2.The presence of voids was observed in the $\mathrm { z n O }$ surface (Figure 2a),which was improved and became continuous and uniform after the spin-casting of CsSt (Figure 2b). In Figure 2c, the AFM height image showed that the $\mathrm { \bar { z } n O }$ nanoparticle flm exhibited a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of $2 8 . 7 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ at a scan scale of $5 \mu \mathrm { m } \times 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ On the other hand,when the $\mathrm { z n O }$ film was covered by $\mathrm { C s } \mathrm { S t } ,$ the surface became smoother with a RMS roughness of $2 1 . 2 \mathrm { n m }$ (Figure 2d)，indicating that the voids between the $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ nanoparticles were partially filled by CsSt and the flm was planarized. The interface traps increased the possibility of trapassisted recombination of the electron,leading to the low fill factor(FF） of device.The smooth film has fewer traps,which decrease this recombination possibility. Hence，the reduced roughness of the $\mathrm { { } } Z \mathrm { { n O } }$ film could contribute to increasing FF. An AFM measurement was also employed to investigate the morphology of the active layer. The RMS roughness of the active layer on the $\mathrm { z n O }$ film was $9 . 6 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ,whichwas higher than that $\left( 7 . 0 \ \mathrm { n m } \right)$ on the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ film (Figure S1, Supporting Information).Obviously, the roughness of the substrate could affect the roughness of the active layer spin-casting on it. The rough active layer was unfavorable for device performance. The influence of CsSt on the electric property of the interlayer was measured by the conductive AFM measurement (Figure S2, Supporting Information)；the current RMS of $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ film was 14.6 nA.When it was covered bya CsSt layer, the current RMS $\mathrm { ( 4 . 1 ~ n A ) }$ was decreased. The lower RMS current implied that the surface electrical conductivity was more uniformly distributed.18,42 While there was some resistance contribution from the lower conductivity in the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ case，the reduction of current RMS should counteract the effects of the low conductance.Additionally，these results implied the importance of using a relatively thin CsSt layer to reduce resistance effects.

The passivation effect on the $\mathrm { z n O }$ film was investigated by photoluminescence (PL) measurements.As shown in Figure 3, $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ has two emission peaks,a near band-edge emission at 373 nm and a deep level emissonbysurface defects at 535 nm.27,43 The PL spectra of $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ were normalized by the emission intensity of the near band-edge at $3 7 3 \ \mathrm { \ n m } . ^ { 3 9 , 4 2 }$ The PL intensity at $5 3 5 \ \mathrm { \ n m } ,$ corresponding to the trap emission, decreased after insertion of a CsSt layer，indicating that the surface defects were restrained and repaired by modification with CsSt (Figure3).28,30,36 In the photovoltaic device,the reduction of traps can decrease the possibility of trap-assisted interfacial recombination of carriers and consequently enhance short-circuit current density $( J _ { \mathrm { s c } } )$ and FF of the device; thus, the PCE of device was improved. The UV-vis transmission spectrum of the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ layer is shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. The $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ layer only absorbed UV light and was transparent in the visible range. This indicated that visible light was allowed to pass through it and irradiate into the active layer.In the meantime，the photodegradation of the polymer active layer induced by UV lightwasreduced.

To investigate the effect of CsSt on the electronic property, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS） was carried out to study the electronic energy levels (highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO）and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO）levels）of the interfacial layer(Figure 4 and $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ and $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ can be determined as $4 . 0 7 \ \mathrm { e V }$ （204 $( \mathrm { Z n O } )$ and $3 . 8 7 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ $\left( { \mathrm { Z n O / C s S t } } \right)$ by subtracting the optical bandgap (3.3 eV for both cases)，as derived from UV absorption result (Figure S4, Supporting Information).The difference in LUMO energy levels between $\mathrm { z n O }$ and $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ showed that the LUMO energy level of $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ was tuned by the CsSt thin layer. The results implied that the incorporation of CsSt formed an intermediate energy gradient at the interface between the interlayerandactive layer,which facilitated the electron transfer to the ITO cathode.32,33

To investigate the impact of CsSt on the performance of the solar cells,the inverted OSCs device was test. The current density-voltage $\left( J - V \right)$ curves under illumination and in the dark with $\mathrm { { Z n O } }$ -only， the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ bilayer,and CsSt-only as interfacial layers are shown in Figure S.The photovoltaic device

Table S1，Supporting Information).The $\mathrm { { } } Z \mathrm { { n O } }$ film shows a photoemission cutoff at $1 7 . 3 3 \ \mathrm { e V } ,$ which corresponds to a work function (WF) of $3 . 8 7 \ \mathrm { e V } .$ After spin-casting the CsSt layer, the WFvalue decreases to $3 . 7 1 \ \mathrm { e V } .$ A $0 . 1 6 \ \mathrm { e V }$ shift indicatesa lowering of the WF of $\mathrm { { } } Z \mathrm { { n O } }$ , leading to a downward vacuum level shift. Thus, the modification of a high WF $\mathrm { { } } Z \mathrm { { n O } }$ surface to a lower WF surface is beneficial for enhancing the built-in potential in devices,which in turn contributed to the enhanced $V _ { \mathrm { o c } }$ and the electron collection to the cathode.36 The HOMO level $( 7 . 1 7 \ \mathrm { e V } )$ of the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ was lowered by $0 . 2 \mathrm { e V }$ relative to the HOMO level $( 7 . 3 7 ~ \mathrm { e V } )$ of $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ .TheLUMOlevelsof parameters of open-circuit voltage $( V _ { \mathrm { o c } } ) , J _ { s c }$ FF,and PCE are summarized in Table 1.The reference device based on $\mathrm { z n O }$ exhibiteda PCE of $7 . 2 2 \%$ ，with $V _ { \mathrm { o c } }$ of $0 . 7 2 9 \mathrm { V } , J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ of $1 5 . 8 8 ~ \mathrm { m A }$ $\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，and FF of $6 2 . 4 \%$ .When CsSt alone was used as an interfacial layer, the $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ of the device was $1 6 . 5 4 \mathrm { \ m A \ c m ^ { - 2 } }$ ，but the $V _ { \mathrm { o c } }$ and FF dropped to $0 . 6 2 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ and $6 0 . 1 \%$ ，respectively. After depositing the CsSt layer onto the $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ flm to reengineer the interface, the device showed an enhanced $V _ { \mathrm { o c } }$ of $0 . 7 3 6 \mathrm { V } , J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ of $1 7 . 0 7 \mathrm { \ m A } \mathrm { \ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ ，and FF of $6 9 . 1 \%$ and hence showed a remarkably enhanced PCEof $8 . 6 9 \%$ in comparison with the reference devices.In order to check the reproducibility of the device,six devices using the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ bilayeras the interfacial layer were examined under the same conditions.The maximum and average PCE were $8 . 6 9 \%$ and $8 . 4 6 \%$ ，respectively，which suggested the device could present excellent performance and favorable reproducibility by using the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ stacked bilayer structure as the cathode interfacial layer.Moreover, the inverted OSCs with a $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ interfacial layer were optimized,and the optimized concentration of CsSt was $1 \ \mathrm { m g \ m \bar { L } ^ { - 1 } }$ ,as shown in Figure SS and Table S2 of the Supporting Information. To further scrutinize the electrical characteristics of the device, the $J { - } V$ curves of the devices with $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ interfacial layers in the dark are presented in Figure Sb.Evidently,the control device showed a high leakage current in the reverse direction. However, the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ -baseddevice exhibited excellentdiode characteristics with a lower leakage current,which was favorable for electron extraction.Figure Sc shows the external quantum efficiency(EQE） spectra of the device based on the $\mathrm { z n O }$ and $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ interlayers.The device with CsSt exhibited a substantial enhancement response from the wavelength range of $3 4 0 { - } 6 5 0 ~ \mathrm { \ n m }$ as compared with that of the $\bar { Z } \mathrm { n O }$ -only interlayer,which leads toa large forward current $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ as shown in Figure Sa.This indicated that the interface between the active layer and $\mathrm { I T O / Z n O }$ was improved by inserting the CsSt layer. To study the effects of the CsSt on the device stability，we performed a side-by-side comparison of the lifetime between non-encapsulated $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O - } } }$ and $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ -baseddevices stored in an argon filled glovebox. Figure 6 shows the normalized

efficiency of the devices versus storage time.As the data shows, the ZnO/CsSt-based device degraded slower than the $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O } . } }$ onlydevice did within 23 days.This indicated that the device lifetime was improved by the modification of CsSt.

To further illustrate the effect of CsSt on the performance of the solar cells,we determine the maximum exciton generation rate $\left( G _ { \mathrm { m a x } } \right)$ and exciton dissociation probability $( \bar { P } )$ in the devices.Figure 7 reveals the effect of the bilayer structure on the photocurrent density $\left( J _ { \mathrm { p h } } \right)$ versus the effective voltage $( V _ { \mathrm { e f f } } )$ $J _ { \mathrm { p h } }$ is calculated as $J _ { \mathrm { p h } } = J _ { \mathrm { L } } - J _ { \mathrm { D } } ,$ where $J _ { \mathrm { L } }$ and $J _ { \mathrm { D } }$ are the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. $V _ { \mathrm { e f f } }$ is determined as $V _ { \mathrm { e f f } } = V _ { 0 } - V _ { \mathrm { a } } ,$ where $V _ { 0 }$ is the voltage at which $J _ { \mathrm { { p h } } }$ is zero and $V _ { \mathrm { a } }$ is the applied voltage. $4 4 - 4 6$ Figure $7 a$ clearly showed that $J _ { \mathrm { p h } }$ increased at a low $V _ { \mathrm { e f f } }$ range for both devices and was saturated at a high $V _ { \mathrm { e f f } } \left( 1 . 5 \mathrm { V } \right)$ . It suggested that all the photogenerated excitons dissociated into free charge carriers and were collected at the electrodes.In this case，saturation current density $\left( J _ { \mathrm { s a t } } \right)$ is only limited by the amount of absorbed incident photons. Thus, the $G _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ could be given from $J _ { \mathrm { s a t } } = $ $q G _ { \mathrm { m a x } } L ,$ where $q$ is the electronic charge and $L$ is the thickness of active layer ( $\left( 1 1 0 \mathrm { n m } \right)$ .45,46 The values of $G _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ for the $Z _ { \mathrm { { n O - } } }$ only and $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ devices are $9 . 7 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 7 } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 3 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ （204号 $\left( J _ { \mathrm { s a t } } = \right.$ $1 7 \dot { 1 } . 2 \mathrm { ~ A ~ m ~ } ^ { - 2 }$ and $1 0 . 2 9 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 7 } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { - 3 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ （20 $\left( { { J _ { \mathrm { { s a t } } } } = 1 8 1 . 3 \mathrm { { A \ m } } ^ { - 2 } } \right)$ respectively. An enhancement of $G _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ occurred after incorporation of the CsSt layer onto the $\mathrm { z n O }$ film. The $P$ values can be obtained from the ratio of $J _ { \mathrm { p h } } / J _ { \mathrm { s a t } }$ (Figure 7b).We can see that exciton dissociation probability of the device with the $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { Z n O } } /$ CsSt bilayer is higher than that of the device with the $\mathrm { { } } Z \mathrm { { n O } }$ -only across the full range. $P$ values under the $J _ { \mathrm { s c } }$ condition increase from $9 2 . 9 \%$ in the $\mathrm { z n O }$ -only device to $9 4 . 2 \%$ in the device with the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ -stacked bilayer structure.Interestingly，in the low effective voltage range,the $P$ values for the two devices show large differences.For example,at $0 . 2 \mathrm { V }$ of $V _ { \mathrm { e f f } } , P$ is $7 9 . 5 \%$ for the device with the $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ -onlyinterlayer,while it is $8 5 . 7 \%$ for the device with the $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ -stacked bilayer structure interlayer.Because the $P$ value is the exciton dissociation efficiency,a lower $P$ value indicates reduced exciton dissociation efficiency. It suggests that exciton recombination begins to dominate the process and thus leads to a lower fill factor in the device without the CsSt layer.47 The $J _ { \mathrm { p h } } { - } V _ { \mathrm { e f f } }$ characteristics from the device with the bilayer interfacial layer identify the effect of CsSt on reducing the exciton recombination and benefiting the dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers at alow effective voltage.An increase in the exciton dissociation probability reduces the recombination rate of excitons and therefore improved the PCEof OSCs.

# CONCLUSION

In this work,we showed that modifying the interface between $\mathrm { z n O }$ and the photoactive layer with CsSt can improve the OSCs performance effectively. SEM and AFM including CAFM characterization showed that CsSt modification to the $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { Z n O } }$ nanoparticle film can effectively modify the film morphology and electric property. PL spectra indicated that the CsSt passivates the surface traps of the $\mathrm { z n O }$ film, which can decrease the possibility of trap-assisted interfacial recombination of the carrers.This was also verified by exiton generation rate $\left( { G _ { \mathrm { m a x } } } \right)$ and dissociation probability $( P )$ measurement. Consequently, $V _ { \mathrm { o c } } , J _ { \mathrm { s c } } ,$ and FF of the inverted solar cells were considerably improved. The PCE of the device therefore with the PTB $7 \mathrm { : P C } _ { 7 1 } \mathrm { B M }$ photoactive layer was significantly improved from the original $7 . 2 2 \%$ to $8 . 6 9 \%$ .These results indicated that the applicable CsSt layer could be applied as the electroncontact modifier layer for high-efficiency inverted polymer solar cell.

# EXPERIMENTALMETHODS

Materials.Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were purchased from Shenzhen Nan Bo Group,China.Electron donor material poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo- $[ 1 , 2 - \mathbf { b } ; 4 , 5 - \mathbf { b } ^ { \prime } ]$ 1 dithiophene- $^ { \cdot 2 , 6 }$ -diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]-thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7）and electron acceptor material [6,6]- phenyl- ${ \bf \cdot C } _ { 7 1 }$ -butyricacid methyl ester $\mathrm { ( P C _ { 7 1 } B M ) }$ were purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech and ADS,respectively.Chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodoctane were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. ${ \mathrm { C s } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { C O } } _ { 3 } ,$ stearic acid and $n$ -butanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { C } } \mathbf { \boldsymbol { o } } .$ ， Ltd.All these commercially available chemicals were used as received. Cesium stearate was synthesized according to the previous report.41 Briefly, $\mathrm { C s } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 3 }$ and stearic acid(1:2 molar ratio）were added to $n$ butanol and kept reflux until no more $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ formed.Subsequently, $n \cdot$ （204号 butanol was separated on the rotary evaporator. The residue was mixed with diethyl etherand aspirated.Zinc oxide nanoparticleswere prepared using an adapted procedure from the literatures.12,48 Briefly, $2 . 9 5 \ \mathrm { g }$ of zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in $1 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of methanol at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ under vigorous stirring.A solution of KOH $\left( 1 . 4 8 \ \mathrm { \ g } \right)$ in methanol ( $\langle 6 5 \mathrm { \ m L } \rangle$ ）was dropped into the zinc acetate dihydrate solution in $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ under vigorous stirring. The solution temperature was held at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and stirred for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and $1 5 \ \mathrm { m i n } ,$ and then, the heater and stirrer were removed to allow the nanoparticles to precipitate for an additional $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ .Precipitate and mother liquor were separated,and the precipitate was washed with $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of methanol for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The suspension was centrifuged to collect the nanoparticles.

Device Fabrication.The device structure was $\mathrm { I T O / Z n O / C s S t / }$ $\mathrm { P T B 7 { : } P C _ { 7 1 } B M / M o O _ { 3 } / A l }$ ，The ITO substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent,deionized water,acetone, and isopropanol for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ,respectively.Then, theywere blown dry with nitrogen.Subsequently， the substrates were moved into an ultraviolet chamber for UV-ozone treatment for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ nanoparticles were dissolved in chloroform,and the solution with a concentration of $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / m L }$ was spin-coated at $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $6 0 ~ \mathsf { s }$ on the ITO substrates and then annealed at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The film thickness is $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ .Next,cesium stearate in methanol with a different concentration was spin-coated at $4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $6 0 ~ \mathsf { s }$ on the top of the $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ film and annealed at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .The thickness of CsSt on the $\mathrm { { z n O } }$ nanoparticle film is too thin to measure.All substrates were then transferred to the argon-filled glovebox for further processing. Electron donor material PTB7 and electron acceptor material $\mathrm { P C } _ { 7 1 } \mathrm { B } \bar { \bf M }$ $\left( 1 0 { : } 1 5 ~ \mathrm { w t / w t } \right)$ were weighed (total concentration is $2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g ~ m L ^ { - 1 } }$ and dissolved in mixed solvents of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane $( 9 7 { : } 3 \%$ by volume) in the argon-filled glovebox. The solution was stirred at 60 $^ { \circ } { \bf C }$ for a minimum of $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and spin-coated on the freshly prepared $\mathrm { Z n O / C s S t }$ interlayer at $2 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $1 2 0 \ s$ in the glovebox. The thickness of the active layer was around $1 1 0 ~ \mathrm { \ n m }$ .The device fabrication was completed after thermal evaporation of $1 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ of $\mathbf { M o O } _ { 3 }$ and $1 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ of Al under vacuum at a base pressure of about $1 \times$ $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ Torr.A shadow mask was used during the thermal evaporation to define the device area of $0 . 0 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$

Measurements and Characterization. The current densityvoltage characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 24oo source meter under 1 sun,AM 1.5G，simulated solar light. The measurement of external quantum efficiency (EQE）was performed using a IQE200TM data acquisition system. Scanning electron microscopy(SEM) images were conducted on a S-48oO scanning electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of $4 \mathrm { k V } .$ Atomic force microscopy(AFM) was used to measure film roughness and surface morphologies in tapping mode using a Veeco dimension V atomic microscope.The AFM cantilever coated with $\mathrm { P t / I r }$ was employed for conductive AFM measurements，and contact mode was selected. The transmittance spectra were recorded onaUV-3300 spectrophotometer.UPS was performed usinga Kratos AXIS ULTRADLD UPS/XPSsystem (Kratos analytical, Manchester, U.K.).UPS was carried out using He I radiation at $2 1 . 2 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ from a discharge lamp operated at $2 0 \mathrm { \ m A } ,$ a pass energy of ${ \mathfrak { s } } { \mathfrak { e V } } _ { \cdot }$ ，anda channel width of $2 5 \ \mathrm { m e V }$ ：
