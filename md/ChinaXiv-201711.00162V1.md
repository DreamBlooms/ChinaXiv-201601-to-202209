ABSTRACTTheadsorptionprocessandhydrogenationmechanismsof 2-methylthiophene on the Pt(111） surface have been elucidated using density functional theory (DFT). The optimal adsorption sites of reactants,intermediates,and products as well as the activation energy and reaction energy of each elementary reactions were investigated.The results turned out that the 2-methylthiophene tilt to the Pt(111) catalyst with the $\displaystyle \mathbf { C } _ { 1 } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { { C } } _ { 2 }$ double bond at the top site was the most stable.During the hydrogenation process， the heat of reaction almost located at the negative side， so dropping the temperature is good for the occurrence of hydrogenation process.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In modern society, with the increasing consumption of energy demand along with the growing shortage of energy supply and the development of people's consciousness to curb greenhouse gas emissons，many research efforts are focused on the exploitation of new types of energy resources[1-5].

Hydrogen is regarded as one of the high-performance, low cost and environmentally-friendly energy resourcel6-8]，which has been widely applied in the fields of electronics,petrochemical, metallurgy, machinery and so on[9-11l However, owing to the storage restrictions of low energy density materials,there are stillsome limitations in the usage of hydrogen[12,13]. As a result, plenty of hydrogen storage materials with high energy density were developed in the last three years[14-17].

2-Methylthiophene (2MT） is a group of representative heteroatom aromatic rings and the electron-donating effects of methyl favor hydrogen release both thermodynamically and kinetically under mild conditions[18,19]. Besides,further cleavage ofoneof the C-S bond during the hydrogenation process can carry an additional mole of hydrogen. For these reasons, it is considered to be one of the effective materials for hydrogen storage. Celis-Cornejo et al.[20] investigated the adsorption of 2MT on the supported catalyst of $\mathrm { C o M o } / \gamma { \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ during the hydrogenation process. They found that the adsorption mechanism is in accordance with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Zhao et al.[19] compared 16 catalysts for hydrogenation and ring-opening of 2MT, finding that the catalyst of Pt exhibited the best reactivity and selectivity. Furthermore,they proposed the possible reaction equation of hydrogenation process. Although there are some researches on the hydrogenation of 2MT currently, the hydrogenation mechanism of the process is very few because of the limitations of characterization and the complexity of reaction.

Density functional theory $( \mathrm { D F T } ) ^ { [ 2 1 , 2 2 ] }$ has become a unique and powerful research approach for examining individual elementary reaction steps at the molecular level. Gecel23] used DFT methods to find that thiophene has a considerable tendency for the protonation and the most probable site of protonation is the $a$ position. Zhu et $a l ^ { [ 2 4 , 2 5 ] }$ studied the most efficient hydrogenation route of thiophene on different crystal planes of $\mathrm { P t }$ catalyst. Our previous theoretical calculations[26-28] have been performed to investigate the adsorption and hydrogenation process of thiophene catalyzed on Au, Pd and $\mathrm { { A u / P d } }$ catalysts in order to study the most favourable pathway for thiophene hydride sulfurization.

Despite these efforts mentioned above,as far as we know,no theoretical reports are available to show the adsorption behavior and hydrogenation process of 2MT on the Pt catalyst. So in this study, Dmol³ program package of DFT method was used to calculate the hydrogenation storage of 2MT and its hydrogenated derivatives on clean Pt(111) surface.The aim of this study is to analyze the possible hydrogenation storage pathways of 2MT and further to make better sense of Pt catalysts at the molecular level for the hydrogenation of 2MT.

# 2 COMPUTATIONALMETHODSANDMODEL

# 2. 1 Methods

All DFT simulations were conducted using the Dmol³ program package[29] in the Materials Studio 6.0 of Accelrys Inc. In the whole study,the Perdew and Wang (PW91)[30-32] function with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA） was adopt. The double numerical basis set with polarization functions (DNP） was employed to describe the valence atomic orbitals. The convergence criterion of energy， maximum force, maximum displacement and maximum self-consistent-field (SCF) were set as $5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \mathrm { e V }$ $2 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { e V / n m }$ $5 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { n m }$ ，and $2 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ eV/atom respectively. Furthermore, the transition states (TS) from reactants and products were searched by means of complete LST (linear synchronous transit)/QST (quadratic synchronous transit) methodl33l. The calculated TS was confirmed by the fact that the structure possesses only one imaginary vibration frequency and the vibrational vector for this imaginary frequency is along the reaction direction.During computation,the Fermi smearing method is employed to determine electron occupancies with a smearing width of $0 . 1 \mathrm { e V } .$ （204号

# 2.2 Catalyst model

Based on the optimized structure of Pt bulk, we built up a four-layer Pt(111) surface with a $( 4 \times$ 4) unit cell ( $6 4 \ : \mathrm { P t }$ atoms in a cell),which corresponds to 1/16 monolayer (ML) for a single 2MT on the surface,as shown in Fig. 1. The reciprocal space was sampled with a $( 5 \times 5 \times 1$ ） $\mathbf { k }$ -points grid generated automatically using the Monkhorst-Pack method and the vacuum region thickness of $1 \ \mathrm { n m }$ was added into the perpendicular direction to prevent the interactions from various periodic configurations. It created a unit in the space by making use of the layer and the vacuum region repeated. During the geometry optimization and TS search, the bottom bilayer for Pt(111) was kept fixed during calculations,while the rest atoms were alowed to move freely. With the parameters presented above,the calculated lattice constant for the Pt(111) surface was $0 . 3 9 2 4 \mathrm { n m }$ which is consistent with the experimental data of $0 . 3 9 2 3 \ \mathrm { n m } ^ { [ 3 4 , \ 3 5 ] }$ 1. The results of simulating calculation show that the method used in this paper is correct and feasible.

# 3 RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

# 3.1Adsorption

Calculation of the adsorption energies is always regarded as an efficient measure, which can be used to illustrate the transform of the adsorbate-substrate before and after adsorption.In this work, the adsorption energy $\left( E _ { \mathrm { a d s } } \right)$ is defined as follows:

$$
E _ { \mathrm { a d s } } = E _ { \left( \mathrm { A / s u r f a c e } \right) } - \left( E _ { \mathrm { A } } + E _ { \mathrm { s u r f a c e } } \right)
$$

Where $E _ { \mathrm { ( A / s u r f a c e ) } }$ is the total energy of 2MT together with the $\mathrm { P t } ( 1 1 1 )$ surface, $E _ { \mathrm { A } }$ is the total energy of free 2MT molecule and $E _ { \mathrm { s u r f a c e } }$ is the total energy of bare surface.By this definition, the more negative values of adsorption energy denote the more stable binding between the 2MT molecule and the $\mathrm { P t } ( 1 1 1 )$ surface.

According to the structure of ring-plane of 2MT and the results that we had been concluded[26-28, 36l,2MT adsorbed in the parallel direction to the $\mathrm { P t } ( 1 1 1 )$ surface is considered to be more stable than in the vertical direction. For this reason,the sixteen possible parallel adsorption sites are labeled by local coordination: (1) four top sites $( 0 ^ { \circ } , 3 0 ^ { \circ } , 6 0 ^ { \circ } , 9 0 ^ { \circ } )$ ，(2) four hcp sites $( 0 ^ { \circ } , 3 0 ^ { \circ } , 6 0 ^ { \circ }$ $9 0 ^ { \circ } .$ ),(3) four fcc sites $( 0 ^ { \circ } , 3 0 ^ { \circ } , 6 0 ^ { \circ } , 9 0 ^ { \circ } )$ and (4) four bridge sites $( 0 ^ { \circ } , 3 0 ^ { \circ } , 6 0 ^ { \circ } , 9 0 ^ { \circ } )$ ,as shown in Fig.1. Different angles in Fig. 1 represent 2MT rotating $0 ^ { \circ }$ $3 0 ^ { \circ }$ $6 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $9 0 ^ { \circ }$ around the symmetry axis of ring-plane from the horizontal.

Table 1 summarizes the calculated adsorption energies of 2MT adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface. In Table 1,the data of adsorption energies are divided into two parts with the energy around -139.0 and $- 1 7 5 . 0 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ . The molecule of 2MT preferred to adsorb in a tilted way through the double bond which is far away from the functional group of methyl. Among different initial positions,2MT adsorbed on the site of Top- ${ \cdot 6 0 } ^ { \circ }$ with the lowest $E _ { \mathrm { a d s } }$ of $- 1 7 5 . 0 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ is regarded as the most stable configuration. Additionally,the top and side views of the most stable structure of 2MT adsorbed on the Top- ${ \cdot 6 0 } ^ { \circ }$ site are shown in Fig. 2.

In Fig.2, the ring-plane spins clockwise around the axial; meanwhile,the methyl associated with the double bond of $\mathbf { C } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ moves away from the $\mathrm { P t } ( 1 1 1 )$ surface during the adsorption process.Finally，2MT adsorbs on the bridge site via $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } { - } \mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ double bond.Table 2 lists the calculated structural parameters of the most stable adsorption site of 2MT on the $\mathrm { P t } ( 1 1 1 )$ surface. By making a result comparison in Table 2, the calculation bond length of 2MT also agrees well with the experimental datal37l. These phenomena suggest that our method in this study is suitable for the adsorption of 2MT on the Pt(111） catalyst. Furthermore,the bond length of $d _ { 2 }$ has the biggest change, suggesting that the double bond of $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } }$ and $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ is the probable site for the beginning of the reaction.

# 3.2Hydrogenation mechanism of 2MT

On the basis of our previous research results[19], the product of hydrogenation was classified into two types of thiols on the Pt catalyst in the reaction process.Fig.3 lists the structures of all intermediates in sequence of the hydrogenation process of 2MT.

We simulated the optimal configuration of reactants (IS)， products (FS） and corresponding transition states (TS) in Fig.3. The activation energies and reaction energies at TS are tabulated in Table 3. Based on the different hydrogenation pathways,we regarded the co-adsorption of 2MT and hydrogen as the first step,and then made a comparison of intermediate steps (steps $1 { \sim } 5$ in Fig. 3).

# 3.2.1

At the start of reaction, we considered the initial product of hydrogenation storage exhibits four different possibilities, including ${ \mathrm { F S } } 1 { \sim } { \mathrm { F S } } 4$ . The calculated barriers $( E _ { \mathrm { a } } )$ , the total energy change $( \Delta E )$ ,and the corresponding structures of IS,TS and FS in the mechanisms of step 1 are shown in Fig. 4.According to our calculations, the approach of $\mathrm { H }$ atom shifted to the bridge site from the adjacent fcc site and the 2MT still adsorbed on the bridge site via the $\displaystyle \mathbf { C } _ { 1 } \mathbf { - } \mathbf { { C } } _ { 2 }$ double bond.

The product of FS1 moved to the left side in the horizontal direction; Meanwhile,the functional group of $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { H }$ tilted upward to be perpendicular to the Pt(111） surface and the atom $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ shifted downward. Finally, the FS1 adsorbed on hollow site via the $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ double bond. The TS1 was also calculated between IS1 and FS1 in Fig.4.When the reaction was carried out,the atom H transferred to the fcc site and the atom $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } }$ moved downward slightly to form the $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { H }$ bond. The first step for the formation of FS1 was exothermic with $\Delta E$ of $- 5 2 . 2 ~ \mathrm { { \ k J } { \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } } }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $1 6 7 . 7 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ ：

The functional group of $\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { H }$ in FS2 tilted upward and the S atom as well as methyl moved downward.Therefore, the FS2 preferred to adsorb at the top site of $\mathrm { P t }$ surface via S.During the formation of FS2, the $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ gradually shifted to the fcc site to get close to $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ for the formation of methylene of ${ \bf C } _ { 2 } \mathrm { - } { \bf H }$ in TS2. The generation of FS2 was exothermic with $\Delta E$ of $- 8 . 1 \ \mathrm { k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ to be $7 5 . 0 \mathrm { k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ ：

The methyl of 2MT in FS3 tilted upward and was almost vertical to the $\mathrm { \sf P t }$ surface,and at the same time,the atom of $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ shifted downward slightly to approach the surface.The FS3 adsorbed on the hollow site via the $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } { \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ double bond was the most stable configuration.In TS3, the H atom moved to the top site，while the functional group of methyl was folded upward. The formation of FS3 was exothermic with $\Delta E$ of $- 5 4 . 9 \ \mathrm { k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was 130.9 $\mathrm { \ k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$

The molecule of FS4 almost has no change as compared to IS1 when the reaction happened. Finally, FS4 adsorbed on bridge site via the $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } { - } \mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ double bond. In TS4, the atom H moved away from the $\mathrm { P t }$ surface to the adjacent fcc site to approach $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ . These phenomena are conductive to the formation of another bond of $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 - \mathrm { H } }$ . The formation of FS4 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of 29.7 $\mathrm { \ k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ of $1 8 7 . 1 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ ：

It can be made a comparison among FS1,FS3 and FS4 from Table 3 and Fig. 4.The activation energy of FS2 is minimum, which indicates that the formation of FS2 is more likely to generate in step 1. This result is consistent with the analysis of the structure parameters in 2MT. Thermodynamically， the relative energy of ${ \mathrm { F S } } 1 { \sim } { \mathrm { F S } } 3$ is exothermic with a negative value. Reducing the temperature can improve the hydrogenation reactions. In contrast, the relative energy of FS4 is endothermic with positive value,so higher temperature is helpful for the hydrogenation reactions.

# 3.2.2 （204号 $\mathrm { I S 2 ^ { * } + H ^ { * } {  } C _ { 5 } H _ { 8 } S ^ { * } }$ (FS5\~FS7)

FS2 is identified as the dominant product in the first step,and further hydrogenation process of step 2 has three possible products: FS5 or FS6 or FS7. The $E _ { \mathrm { a } } , \ \Delta E$ ， and the corresponding structures of IS,TS and FS of step 2 are shown in Fig.5.It is observed that step 2 begins with the co-adsorption of FS2 and H. The FS2 adsorbed on the top site via the $s$ and $\mathrm { H }$ atoms moved to the bridge site when the co-adsorption happened.

For the product of FS5, its S atom shifted downward to the $\mathrm { \sf P t }$ surface and the reacted methyne tilted upward to relieve the steric hindrance for the $\mathrm { H }$ atom.Ultimately, the FS5 adsorbed on the top site of Pt surface through the S atom. In TS5, the $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ atom shifted to the hollow site to get close to the reacted $\boldsymbol { a }$ C, finally forming a new $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { H }$ bond. The formation of FS5 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of $1 1 . 6 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ to be $1 6 4 . 6 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

For the product of FS6, we can see that the methyl moved upward slightly and its product stil adsorbed on the top site through the S atom. Moreover, we optimize the configuration of TS6,as shown in Fig.5.The atom H shifted away from the surface to approach $\mathbf { C } _ { 3 }$ to form another bond of $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 - \mathrm { H } }$ ，while the distance between $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ reduced from 0.4215 to $0 . 2 6 4 4 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ . The formation of FS6 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of $5 . 3 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $1 9 . 5 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

For product FS7, the atoms of $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { C _ { 4 } }$ located closely to the surface and the methyl migrated upward to be perpendicular to the surface due to the attack of $\mathrm { H }$ atom. At last,FS7 adsorbed on the top site through atom S. In TS7, the atom $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ shifted from the bridge site to the fcc site and the relevant $\mathrm { C _ { 4 } \mathrm { - } H }$ distance was reduced to O.5057 nm from $0 . 2 4 5 8 \mathrm { n m }$ in IS2. The formation of FS7 is endothermic: $\Delta E = 7 6 . 4 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and $E _ { \mathrm { a } } = 1 0 9 . 3 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

As shown in Table 3 and Fig.5,the relative energy of FS5-FS7 was endothermic with positive value,so raising the temperature was benefit for the second step of hydrogenation reaction. Moreover,the relative energy as well as the reaction energy of FS6 is the lowest among the different products. These phenomena implied that the process to FS6 from IS2 was more likely to happen in step 2.

# 3.2.3 $\mathrm { I S 3 ^ { * } + H ^ { * } {  } C _ { 5 } H _ { 9 } S ^ { * } }$ (FS8 or FS9)

In step 2, FS6 was deemed as the dominant product, which would further hydrogenate to form FS8 or FS9.The activation and reaction energies of IS,TS and FS in the mechanisms of step 3 are illustrated in Fig. 6. It begins from the most favorable co-adsorption configuration of FS6 and the H atom. Through optimization, the $\mathrm { H }$ atom shifted away from fcc site to the bridge site and the FS6 adsorbed on hollow site through the S atom.

The product of FS8 transferred to the bottom right and the atoms of $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } { - } C _ { 4 } }$ shifted away from the Pt surface.Meanwhile, the atom ${ \bf C } _ { 5 }$ moved downward to make the bond of $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { C } _ { 5 }$ parallel to the surface.Finally,the FS8 adsorbed on the top site through the atom S.In TS8,the atom H migrated to get close to the atom of $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and the relevant $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { H }$ distance was reduced to $0 . 3 5 8 1 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ from $0 . 4 9 1 1 \mathrm { n m }$ in the IS3.The formation of FS8 was exothermic with $\Delta E$ of $- 1 0 2 . 1 \ \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and

the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $6 7 . 9 \mathrm { k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$

During the process of IS3-FS9, there was a significant distortion in atoms $\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ . The FS9 adsorbed on the top site via the S atom is the most stable configuration.The H atom shifted to the adjacent hollow site,while the methylene of $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ tilted up,as shown in TS9. The formation of FS9 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of $5 . 3 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $9 7 . 3 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

According to the above results of simulations,IS3 prefers to hydrogenate on $| a { - } C _ { 1 }$ rather than $a { - } C _ { 2 }$ . The generation of FS8 is exothermic, while that of FS9 is endothermic. In addition,a lower barrier of $6 7 . 9 \ \mathrm { k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ along with a shorter bond length is present for the $d { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { C } _ { 1 } { \mathrm { - } } \mathbf { H }$ bond formed in FS8. Consequently, the hydrogenation of IS3 to FS8 is likely to occur.

# 3.2.4 $\mathbf { I S 4 ^ { * } } + \mathbf { H ^ { * } } {  } \mathbf { C } _ { 5 } \mathbf { H } _ { 1 0 } \mathbf { S ^ { * } }$ (FS10)

From previous discussion in step 3,the FS8 is identified as the most optimal product. There is only one kind of possible pathway for further hydrogenation of FS8 to form the saturate production of ${ \mathrm { C s H } } _ { 1 0 } { \mathrm { S } }$ . The activation and reaction energies of IS,TS and FS in the mechanisms of step 4 are shown in Fig. 7. It can be perceived that the initial hydrogenation channel of step 4 was the co-adsorption of FS8 and atom H. After co-adsorption, the H atom located at the bridge site and the FS8 kept almost the same structure, as compared in step 4.

The product of FS1O slanted towards the Pt(111) surface through the atom S,and at the same time,the functional group of methyl tilted upward to decrease the steric hindrance of the reaction. In TS1O, the H atom transferred to the adjacent top site to approach the atom of $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ and finally a new bond of $\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { H }$ was formed. The formation of FS1O was exothermic with $\Delta E$ of $- 9 7 . 0 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $1 1 2 . 6 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

# 3.2.5 $\mathbf { I S 5 ^ { * } } + \mathbf { H ^ { * } } {  } \mathbf { C } _ { 5 } \mathbf { H } _ { 1 1 } \mathbf { S ^ { * } }$ (FS11\~FS14)

In step 5,FS1O is further hydrogenated to thiol by the help of $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ atom.The activation and reaction energies of IS,TS and FS in the mechanisms of step 5 are shown in Fig.8.The hydrogenation began with the FS1O locating at top site on the Pt(111) surface through the atom S and the $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ atom moved from fcc site to the top site

The atoms of ${ \bf C } _ { 2 } – { \bf C } _ { 5 }$ in FS11 tilted upward and distorted hugely.At the same time, the atoms of $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and S moved downward,which made FS1l adsorb on the Pt surface stably. In TS11,the distance between the $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ and S atoms reduced from O.3600 to $0 . 2 5 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .This phenomenon caused the bond of $d _ { 1 }$ to break, which was accompanied by the shift of H atom to the adjacent top site and downward shift of S atom, respectively. The formation of FS11 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of 48.9 $\mathrm { \ k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $1 1 6 . 9 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

The methyl of $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ in FS12 shifted to the hcp site and the bonds of $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ to ${ \bf C } _ { 5 }$ kept in a straight line from top view. Finally, the FS12 adsorbed on top site through atom S. In TS12,the atom H moved to the adjacent bridge site and the bond of $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathbf { C } _ { 3 }$ rotated clockwise to get close with the attacking $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ atom. The forming distance of $d { \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { C } { \mathrm { - } } \mathrm { H }$ reduced from 0.2770 to $0 . 2 0 6 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ The formation of FS12 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of $3 9 . 3 \ \mathrm { k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was 388.2 kJ-mol-1.

The molecule of FS13 rotated anticlockwise. Meanwhile,atoms ${ \bf C } _ { 3 ^ { - } } { \bf C } _ { 5 }$ tilted upward to keep away from the Pt surface.For these reasons,the FS13 adsorbed on top site through atom S. The TS13 was also calculated between IS5 and FS13 in Fig.8. The atom H shifted to the adjacent fcc site to get close to the S atom, resulting in a decrease of distance between atoms S and $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ from 0.3600 to $0 . 1 9 7 0 \mathrm { n m }$ . The formation of FS13 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of $1 3 8 . 3 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $2 3 3 . 9 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

There was a huge distortion in the product of FS14, when the reaction occurred. The methyl rotated anticlockwise based on the atom of $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ and the $\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ bond was folded up.In TS14, the H atom moved to bridge site to get close to $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ to generate the bond of $\mathrm { C _ { 4 } \mathrm { - } H }$ ，while the distance between dissociative $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ reduced from 0.4582 to $0 . 2 9 8 7 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ，The formation of FS14 was endothermic with $\Delta E$ of $1 3 . 0 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $4 1 6 . 0 \mathrm { k J \cdot m o l ^ { - 1 } }$ ：

Through a comparative analysis of the calculation results of IS,TS and FS in Fig.8,we can see the reaction energy of FS11 is $1 1 6 . 9 \mathrm { \ k J { \cdot } m o l { \cdot } l }$ ，which was the smallest among FS11-FS14. Moreover, the relative energy of different products in step 5 was positive, thus high temperature was beneficial to improve the reaction. Based on the kinetic and thermodynamic opinions,the hydrogenation of FS10 on $\mathrm { P t }$ surface is more likely to produce FS11 rather than FS12～FS14. These phenomena suggest that FS11 is more competitive in step 5.

The FS11 is the dominant product in step 5.Fig.9 illustrates the activation and reaction energies of IS,TS and FS in the final step of hydrogenation process. The hydrogenation began with the co-adsorption of FS11 and H atom. When step 6 started, the $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ atom shifted to top site and the structure of ${ \mathrm { C } } _ { 5 } { \mathrm { H } } _ { 1 1 } S$ remained the same as FS11.

For the final product of FS15,the molecule twisted like a shape from the top view and adsorbed at the top site via the S atom. For the intermediate of TS15,the methyl of $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ moved upward, and at the same time,the atom $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ shifted to the adjacent hollow site to get close to $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ ，while the distance between atoms $\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ reduced from 0.3017 to $0 . 2 4 6 0 \mathrm { n m }$ .The formation of FS15 was exothermic with $\Delta E$ of $- 1 5 . 8 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$ and the corresponding $E _ { \mathrm { a } }$ was $2 1 0 . 8 \mathrm { k J } { \cdot } \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }$

# 3.3Brief summary about hydrogenation process of 2MT

In this study， possible pathways involved in the hydrogenation mechanism of 2MT were investigated.The landscape of potential energy surface (PES) for each step is shown in Fig.10. As Fig.10 shows,the most favorable hydrogenation mechanism follows the steps as below: the 2MT was hydrogenated to FS2 which then underwent a second hydrogenation to yield FS6. The FS6 can further be hydrogenated to generate FS8. Then FS8 underwent hydrogenation to form FS10 which can undergo a fourth hydrogenation to produce FS11. Finally， the FS1l can be hydrogenated to generate pentane-2-thiol (FS15). These results are in agreement with the previous experimental studies in the literaturel19]. During the different steps in Fig.1O,the first hydrogen step to generate FS1 was the rate-determining step.

# 4 CONCLUSION

We have investigated and compared the adsorption and hydrogenation mechanisms of 2-methylthiophene using periodic density functional theory method. Various adsorption modes of the intermediates involved in the reaction were studied from the energetic and geometrical viewpoints,and the hydrogenation mechanism has been clarified. The major findings can be summarized as follows.

Our calculations show that the tilt adsorption of 2MT at the top site through the $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } { \ - } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ double bond is the most stable. With the increase of bond length of 2MT after the adsorption happened, the atom H will most likely to attack the double bond of $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ of 2MT.

The dominantmechanismofhydrogenationprocess follows thesteps of $\mathrm { \bf C } _ { 2 } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 3 } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 1 } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 4 } {  } \mathrm { \bf S } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 1 }$ to generate pentane-2-thiol from the view of dynamics. The hydrogenation process of 2MT is almost exothermic, so that dropping the temperature is beneficial for the hydrogenation process. In addition, the first step of hydrogenation of 2MT with the highest

activation barrier is the rate-determining step.

# Theoretical Study on the Adsorption and Hydrogenation Mechanism of 2-Methylthiophene over the Pt(11l) Catalyst

SHIWei(施炜） NI Zhe-Ming(倪哲明)XIASheng-Jie(夏盛杰） SUWei-Ke(苏为科)

The tilt adsorption of 2-methylthiophene molecule on the Pt(111） surface at the top site through the double bond of $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ is the most stable.The dominant channel follows the hydrogenation step of $\mathrm { \bf C } _ { 2 } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 3 } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 1 } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 4 } {  } \mathrm { \bf S } {  } \mathrm { \bf C } _ { 1 }$ to generate the product of pentane-2-thiol. And the storage is almost exothermic, so that reducing the temperature is beneficial to the reaction.
