In this paper,we will give a general introduction to the project of Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT)，which is a Sino-US joint project led by the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP)and has involved many diferent institutes in China.It is the first ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment in China and an integral part of China's Gravitational Waves Program.The main scientific goal of AliCPT project is to probe the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) originated from the very early Universe.

The AliCPT project includes two stages. The first stage referred to as AliCPT-1, is to build a telescope in the Ali regionof Tibet with analtitude of 5,250 meters.Once completed,it will be the worldwide highest ground-based CMB observatory and open a new window for probing PGWs in northern hemisphere.AliCPT-1 telescope is designed to have about 7,000 TES detectors at 90GHz and 150GH $\boldsymbol { \mathbf { \mathit { Z } } }$ . The second stage is to have a more sensitive telescope (AliCPT-2) with the number of detectors more than 20.000.

Our simulations show that AliCPT will improve the current constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by one order of magnitude with 3 years’observation.Besides the PGWs,the AliCPT will also enable a precise measurement on the CMB rotation angle and provide a precise test on the CPT symmetry. We show 3 years’ observation will improve the current limit by two order of magnitude.

# I.INTRODUCTION

Searching for gravitational waves (GWs)has long been the cornerstone of cosmologyand astrophysics since Einstein proposed the General Relativity(GR) inearly 2Oth century.GWsare thought to be the last pieceof the theoretical predictions of GR.Withlong-lasting eforts,LIGO(Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory)collaboration in 2016announced the firstdetection ofGWs with the signals coming from two merging black holes with mass of tens of solar masses[1].Since then,LIGOand Virgo have announced other three events of black hole GWs [2-4].These achievements make the GWs study to enter a new era and were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics this year.

Diffrent from the GWs detected by LIGO and Virgo,the PGWs arise from quantum fluctuations and carry important information about the very early Universe,for example,the physics of inflation,bouncing and emergent Universe. So far the most efective way to probe PGWs is to measure the B-mode polarization of CMB.

The CMB photons are relics left after the Big Bang.Its first detection half a century ago pioneered the study of cosmology.For the recent 20 to 30 years,CMB observations have developed rapidly,leading us into the precision cosmology era.However,the CMB B-mode polarization induced by the tensor fluctuations generated in the early Universe,i.e.,the PGWs,stillhave not been detected conclusively1.This hasbecome a key scientific goal of CMB observations inrecent years.In adition, CMB B-modes provideus an important test on fundamental physics,such as the CPT symmetry.

At present, major ground-based CMB experiments are in southern hemisphere, for example,the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)and POLARBEAR/Simons Array in Chile,and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and BICEP at the SouthPole.High precision experiments inthe northern hemisphere arecritically needed to achieveafullskycoverage. In 2014,IHEP cosmology team proposed a CMB experiment in Ali of Tibet,aiming to search for the PGWs in northernhemisphere.In this paper we provide a general introduction tothe AliCPT project.In section I, we introduce the atmospheric conditions,skycoverage and infrastructureofAliCPT.In section II, we present the main scientific goals of AliCPT. Section IV is our summary.

# II. OVERVIEWOF THE ALICPT SITE

Ali prefecture is in the west of the Tibetan Plateau with vast highlands and the siteof AliCPT is located on top of a peak in the northwest of Gangdise mountain range with many peaks higher than 5,0o0m and even 6,00m. The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway (offciallycalled theChina National Highway219)as wellas the Ngari Gunsa Airport are not far from the site.

In this section,we describe the atmospheric conditions,sky coverage and the infrastructure of AliCPT site,which re crucial to ground-based CMB experiments.

·Atmospheric conditions:For ground-based CMB telescopes,the atmosphere is inescapable.The absorption and emission at millimeter/sub-millimeter band by the air molecules reduce the significance of signals.Among all components of the air,water vapor plays a crucial role due to its strong absorption/emisson and heavy time variation. Usually,the Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is used as a conventional parameter to characterize the amount of water vapor,which is defined as the overall depth of water in a column of the atmosphere above the ground. CMB signals,especially the polarization signals,are extremely weak,so observation requires the air of the site to be thin,dryand stable.In the upper panel of Figure1,we show the global distribution of the mean values of PWV over the past 6 years (2011.7-20l7.7). It's obvious that only four regions have the lowest PWV on earth, including the Antarctic,Atacama Desert, Greenland and the high Tibetan Plateau.

AliCPT site is located at a 5,250m high peak of the Gangdise Mountain. The Himalayas is to its southwest and runs from northwest to southeast,separating Ali area from the Indian subcontinent as well as the Indian Ocean,which is shown in the lower panel of Figure 1.So the wet air from the Indian Ocean is largely reduced. This makes air of AliCPT site to be thin and dry enough around Winter.In[7],we quantitatively analyzed the atmospheric conditions of the site using radiosondes data from the local weather station as wellas MERRA-2 reanalysis data from NASA/GMAO.The results show that PWV of Ali have a very strong seasonal variation and the median PWV of the observing season (October to March) is about lmm (1.07mm for MERRA-2,0.92mm for radiosondes), which is excellent to observation at 90/150GHz.We show cumulative fraction of time versus PWV in Figure 2. References [8,9] have also done the atmospherical conditions evaluation for Ali region.

· Sky coverage:The AliCPT site is located at geographical coordination ( $8 0 ^ { \circ } 0 1 ^ { \prime } E$ ， $3 2 ^ { \circ } 1 9 ^ { \prime } N$ ). With the rotation of the earth and the mid-latitude location,AliCPTis able to cover the whole northern sky as welas the low latitude partof the southern sky,and the overallobservable fraction is about 70 percent.We show this inFigure 3as the region above the black dashed line.Inour calculation we choose the instrumental parameters to be a $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ lowest elevation for the mount and a $3 0 ^ { \circ }$ field of view (FOV). The overlap in the low latitude region of observable skyof Ali and Atacama makes it convenient todo cros-check and cross-correlation studies.Known as the northern hole,the lowest foreground contaminated region in the northern galactic hemisphere is also within the observable sky of AliCPT,which is extremely important for a CMB B-mode polarization and PGWs aimed project.We show the target fields of AliCPT in Figure 3.TN1 and TN2 within the black solid lines are target fields in the northern galactic hemisphere and TS in the southern galactic hemisphere.TND with the lowest dust intensity is chosen for deeper survey.

So the sky coverage (both observable and low foreground contamination sky)of AliCPT is complement to that of experiments in Antarctic and Atacama.Together with the southern cleanest sky region that covered by southern projects such as BICEP and Simons Array,AliCPT willincrease the chance to find the B mode and PGWs.For more details about sky coverage,we refer to [7].

·Infrastructure:On the transportation,the National Highway 219 is right next to the AliCPT site.Moreover, the Ngari Gunsa Airport is only about half an hour driving distance to the site and has a daily commercial fight toLhasa,the capital of Tibet.The largest setlementof Ali area,Shiquanhe town is also veryclose to the site and it takes only 3O minutes driving to get there.

From the aerial view around Ali astronomical observatory at A1 point (left panel of Figure 4),we can see that, AliCPT site at Bl is not far from Al point,the distance between them is only about 1km.The concrete road from Al to B1 is already under construction and willbe finished soon.In Ali astronomical observatory at A1 point,city grid electric power and the network infrastructure for data transmission are ready now.Some optical telescopes for astrophysics have been set up. Started in March 2017,the site construction of AliCPT is already ongoing and willbe finished by the endof this year.After the commisioning in 2019,theobservation is expected to start in 2020.

In short,AliCPT opens anew window in the northern hemisphere to detect CMB B-mode polarization and probe :he PGWs.

# III. ALICPT ANDITSSCIENTIFICGOALS

In this section,we frstly introduce the main contents of AliCPT project,then perform the simulations on scientific goals.AliCPT project consists of two stages.The first stage is to develop and deploy a CMB polarization telescope at 5,250 meters,caled AliCPT-1.AliCPT-1 telescope isa dichroic refractor of aperture 70cm covering90/150GHz, with a three-axis driving mount scanning at speed of $5 ^ { \circ } / s$ in azimuth. AliCPT-1 adopts Transition Edge Sensor(TES) bolometers used widely in current CMB polarization experiments[10],and takes Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs)as cryogenic readout.Sensors and their readout willbe packaged into highly integrated modules, and each modulecontains1,704 TES sensors.Four modules willbe installed in AliCPT-1 telescope bytheend of 2019 and the number of detectors will reach 6,816.

In the second stage, we will have a more sensitive telescope (AliCPT-2) with 12 modules and detectors more than 20,000.The construction of AliCPT-2 willstart in 2020.Ineach year,we willinstallfour modules and fnish the 12 modules by the endof 2O22.In TableIwe summarize thebasic instrumentalparameters used for the simulationsand the corresponding schedule of AliCPT-1 and AliCPT-2.

The main scientific goals of AliCPT include:

·Start the large coverage surveys in northern hemisphere and search for regions with low foreground contamination;   
· Target at the cleanest sky region and detect PGWs in the northern hemisphere;   
· Measure the CMB rotation angle in high precision and test the CPT symmetry;   
· Study the hemispherical asymmetry in combination with experiments in southern hemisphere;   
· Measure E-mode polarization in high precision and study the effects in cosmology;   
· Study cross-correlation of CMB polarization with the large scale structures (LSS).

In the following,we provide the simulation on the sensitivity of the measurement on $r$ and the CMB rotation angle.

# A.Sensitivity on $r$ and its implication on the Early Universe Physics

Theleading scenario of theearly Universe is the inflationary cosmology, which describes anaccelerating expanding phase occured before radiation epoch. Inflation resolves several conceptual isues of the Big Bang theory including thefatnes,monopole,and horizon problems[11].Moreover,inflation explains theoriginof primordial perturbations, with a mechanism that the quantum fuctuations of inflaton field were stretched to be classcal perturbations by exponential expansion of space.The primordial perturbations have thre types: scalar,vector and tensor. Scalar modes will eventually seed the CMB temperature anisotropies and also lead to the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe.Tensor modes,which are dubbed as PGWs,willintroduce CMB B-mode polarization,which is the target signal in AliCPT observations. Conventionally, we often use $r$ ， $n _ { t }$ and some other parameters to describe tensor perturbations,where $r$ means the ratio of the amplitudes of power spectra of primordial tensor $A _ { T }$ and scalar modes （204号 $A _ { S }$ ， $n _ { t }$ represents the logarithmic derivative via

$$
r \equiv { \frac { A _ { T } } { A _ { S } } } , n _ { t } \equiv { \frac { d \ln { \cal P } _ { t } } { d \ln k } } \ ,
$$

FIG.5:Comparison of theoretical model predictions with the CMB experiments through the $n _ { t } \ - \ T$ diagram. The green line and red line give the $2 \sigma$ sensitivity reached by AliCPT until 2022 and 2025.

where $P _ { t }$ is the power spectrum of tensor mode,k is the wave number.

Since inflationary cosmology stillsuffer from the initial cosmic singularity issue[12,13],alternative theoretical approaches havebeen proposed,including bounce cosmology [14],cyclic Universe [15],and emergent Universe16]. Similar to inflation,these theories can also generate primordial tensor perturbations.However,PGWs generated from different theories have diferent characteristics,which willbe refected on the shape of CMB BB spectrum.The comparison of typical model predictions for the $\boldsymbol { r } - \boldsymbol { n } _ { t }$ relationship with the present and forthcoming CMB experiments is shown in Figure5[17].Wecan see that high precision measurementsof PGWsare crucial in testing models of early Universe.

We have performed simulations toforecast theconstraining capabilityof the AliCPT survey.Toobtain theconstraint on $r$ derived from the AliCPT observations, we adopt the Fisher matrix approach [18], which is an efficient way to forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters given the specification of the instruments.

Generally, the likelihood function of a multivariate Gaussian-distributed data vector $\mathbf { d }$ can be expressed as,

$$
\mathcal { L } = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { \vert \mathbf { C } ( \theta ) \vert } } \exp \left( - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \mathbf { d } ^ { \dagger } [ \mathbf { C } ( \theta ) ] ^ { - 1 } \mathbf { d } \right) ,
$$

where $\theta$ is the parameter vector,and $\mathbf { C }$ is the covariance matrix which is a function of $\theta$ in general. The Fisher matrix, $F _ { i j }$ , which is the second partial derivative of the likelihood function with respect to parameters $\theta _ { i }$ and $\theta _ { j }$ evaluated at the fiducial model,approximates the Hessan matrix,and the inverse of the diagonal terms $( \mathbf { F } ^ { - 1 } ) _ { i i }$ provides an estimateof the lower limit of the variance for parameter $\theta _ { i }$ ,i.e., $\Delta \theta _ { i } \gtrsim ( \mathbf { F } ^ { - 1 } ) _ { i i } ^ { 1 / 2 }$ [18].

For the case of CMB, $\mathbf { d } = \{ X _ { \ell m } ^ { \nu } , \ldots \}$ ， where $\mathrm { X } \in \{ T , E , B \}$ ，and $\nu$ runs over all available frequency bands. Each （204号 $X _ { \ell m } ^ { \nu }$ consists of three components,namely,the lensed CMB,the foreground emission and the instrumental noise.The Fisher matrix for the CMB observables is,

$$
F _ { i j } = \sum _ { \ell } { \frac { 2 \ell + 1 } { 2 } } f _ { \mathrm { s k y } } \mathrm { T r } \left[ \mathbf { C } _ { \ell } ^ { - 1 } { \frac { \partial \mathbf { C } _ { \ell } } { \partial \theta _ { i } } } \mathbf { C } _ { \ell } ^ { - 1 } { \frac { \partial \mathbf { C } _ { \ell } } { \partial \theta _ { j } } } \right]
$$

where $\ell$ denotes the order of the multipole, $f _ { \mathrm { s k y } }$ is the sky coverage, and $\mathbf { C } _ { \ell }$ is the covariance matrix in harmonic space which can be expressed as,

$$
\mathbf { C } _ { \ell } ( X _ { \ell m } ^ { \mu } , Y _ { \ell m } ^ { \nu } ) = C _ { \ell } ^ { X Y , \mu \nu } + F _ { \ell } ^ { X Y , \mu \nu } + N _ { \ell } ^ { X Y , \mu \nu } \ ,
$$

![](images/70049ccb002d6b5e568c0105ac55d8717b2d03f53b81130bd095b4d853c8e028.jpg)  
FIG.6:Leftpanel:Sensitivityofrwithoutdelensing.Right panel:Sensitivityofrwithcompletelydelensing.Thehorizontal olackdashed line is the current limit $r < 0 . 0 7$ ：

where $C _ { \ell }$ ， $F _ { \ell }$ ， $N _ { \ell }$ correspond to spectra of the lensed CMB,foreground and instrumental noise respectively. We have assumed that observed temperature and polarization are statistically isotropic,so that terms of diffrent $\ell$ 's are independent.

We use CAMB [19] to calculate the CMB spectra $C _ { \ell }$ , and choose a fiducial cosmology which is consistent with the Planck 2015 results[20].Theoretically,theB-mode signal from lensing willexceed that from the primordial signal when on recombination bump ( $\ell \sim 1 0 0$ ） $r$ falls below O.O1. Therefore, to achieve a high precision detection of the primordial B-mode signal,we shall performadelensing procedure toremovethe lensing effect fromdata.Weconsider two cases inour simulations for acomparison,namely,the cases of totally-delensed and undelensed.During the actual operation, we will use the data of AliCPT and other small scale CMB surveys at high $\ell$ to reconstruct lensing spectra. Other approaches, e.g., cross-correlating CMB with large scale surveys, will also be considered.

Based on results of recent experiments, foreground emission $F _ { \ell }$ is thought to dominate over all frequency bands and all scales.This kind of contamination can be removed through multi-frequency surveys,since the frequency spectrum distributions of CMB and other components are diferent.Component separation is then defined as a method estimating the amount of each emission component.Even such a separation has been applied,some extent of residual foreground stillremains indata.The AliCPT telescope plans to scan the cleanest sky regions at 90/150 GHz,in order to suppressresidual foreground as much as possible.Inour Fisher forecasting,we consider two kinds of components,namely,the synchrotronand thermal dust,whichcontribute to the dominatepartof polarized foreground emission. Besides $r$ , we take six additional parameters into free parameter space, including $\boldsymbol { A } _ { \mathrm { d u s t } }$ ， $A _ { \mathrm { s y n c } }$ corresponding to amplitudes of dust and synchrotron at $\ell = 8 0$ with pivot frequencies of 353 GHz and 23 GHz respectively, $\alpha _ { \mathrm { d u s t } }$ and $\alpha _ { \mathrm { s y n c } }$ corresponding to spectral index in harmonic space, $\beta _ { \mathrm { d u s t } }$ and $\beta _ { \mathrm { s y n c } }$ corresponding to spectral index in frequency space.And no conversion between these two components,dust and synchrotron is assumed in our study.

In our simulations,we asume that the AliCPT instrumental noise of temperature and polarization are uncorrelated, and an isotropic Gaussian random noise for simplicity. The temperature spectrum is given by $N _ { \ell } = w ^ { - 1 } B _ { \ell } ^ { 2 }$ where $B _ { \ell }$ is the harmonic transform of the Gaussian beam, reads, $B _ { \ell } = \exp ( - \ell ( \ell + 1 ) \theta _ { \mathrm { F W H M } } ^ { 2 } / 8 \log 2 )$ . The weight is then,

$$
w ^ { - 1 } = \frac { 4 \pi f _ { \mathrm { s k y } } \mathrm { N E T ^ { 2 } } } { t _ { \mathrm { o b s } } N _ { \mathrm { d e t } } } ,
$$

where NET means the Noise Equivalent Temperature which is closelyrelated withthe detectorperformance,instrument design and atmospheric condition, $t _ { \mathrm { o b s } }$ is the effective observation time (from October to March,10h per day) and $N _ { \mathrm { d e t } }$ is the number of detectors. Note for polarization, NET should be multiplied by a factor of $\sqrt { 2 }$ since each polarized signal needs two orthogonal linear polarized detectors.In Table I,we show the instrumental parameters for our calculation.

We plot our results in Figure 6. Simulated sensitivity of $r$ under undelensed and totally-delensed assumptions are showed in the leftandright panels.Casesrelated to1,5,and10percentofresidual foregroundareconsidered inboth panels.Dashed black lines represent current representative constraint on $r$ ， $r < 0 . 0 7$ at $2 \sigma$ , obtained from the joint analyses of BICEP2/Keck Arrayand Planck[21].As one can see from the plots,even in the undelensed case with 10 percent residual foreground, after 3 years' survey of AliCPT, the sensitivity on $r$ will reach $\sigma _ { r } = 0 . 0 0 7$ ,which is nearlyone order of magnitude stronger thancurrent constraint.Bythe end of 2025,after 3years’observation with 16 detector modules (around 270oo TES detectors), the constraint on $r$ in delensed case will reach a level of 0.0o3. Not surprisingly, less residual foreground leads to a better result on $r$ . If we can suppress foreground down to the one percent level, and apply a delensing procedure,we will obtain $\sigma _ { r } \sim 0 . 0 0 1$ . Much stronger limit of $r$ can help us with testing alarge numberofcosmological modelsof theearly Universe.Due toits highprecision,the AliCPTproject will provide us a new vision of the early Universe.

# B.Sensitivity on the CMB Polarization Rotation Angle and its implication on the CPT Test

Testing CPT symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation (C),parity reflection (P)and time reversal (T) is important to cosmology and particle physics.Any violation,iffound,would beapowerful and important clue for new physics beyond the standard model. So far,the laboratory experiments are consistent with a nullresult for the CPT violation.However,these tests may not be applied to physical processs in the early Universe at extremely high energy scales.In fact,there are motivations to speculateon the CPT violation incosmology.Firstly,the expanding Universe has a prefered temporal direction, which provides a natural frame to break the Lorentz and CPT symmetries. Secondly,the observed baryon and anti-baryon asymmetry in the Universe may indicatea dynamical CPT violation [22, 23].

To study the cosmological CPT violation in CMB,we consider the following effective Lagrangian,

$$
{ \mathcal L } _ { C S } = p _ { \mu } A _ { \nu } \widetilde F ^ { \mu \nu } ~ ,
$$

where the external field $p _ { \mu }$ is a constant vector[24], or $p _ { \mu } \sim \partial _ { \mu } \phi$ with $\phi$ being the dark energy scalar in quintessential baryo/leptogensis[23, 25], or $p _ { \mu } \sim \partial _ { \mu } R$ with $R$ the Ricci Scalar in gravitational baryo/leptogensis[26, 27], ${ \widetilde { F } } ^ { \mu \nu } =$ $( 1 / 2 ) \epsilon ^ { \mu \nu \rho \sigma } F _ { \rho \sigma }$ is the dual tensor of the electromagnetic tensor $F _ { \mu \nu }$ . With the Chern-Simons term in (6),the polarization directions of photons get rotations for CMB,this willconvert partofE-mode polarization to the B-mode and change the power spectra of polarization felds [28-30]. In Table $\mathrm { I I }$ , we summarized the constraints on the rotation angle from various experiments.The current limit on the rotation angle $\alpha$ is about $1 ^ { \circ }$ ：

We have performed simulations to forecast the sensitivity on the measurements of the rotation angle with AliCPTs For the forecast, we employ the so-called D-estimators[41] defined as follows,

$$
\begin{array} { r l r } {  { D _ { \ell } ^ { \mathrm { T B , o b s } } = C _ { \ell } ^ { \mathrm { T B , o b s } } \cos ( 2 \beta ) - C _ { \ell } ^ { \mathrm { T E , o b s } } \sin ( 2 \beta ) ; } } \\ & { \colon } & { D _ { \ell } ^ { \mathrm { E B , o b s } } = C _ { \ell } ^ { \mathrm { E B , o b s } } \cos ( 4 \beta ) - \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { 2 } ( C _ { \ell } ^ { \mathrm { E E , o b s } } - C _ { \ell } ^ { \mathrm { B B , o b s } } ) \sin ( 4 \beta ) , \quad } \end{array}
$$

where $\beta$ is the unbiased estimator for the cosmic rotation angle $\alpha$

We modifed the generic Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampler provided in the CosmoMC package[42] and erformed the calculation with instrumental properties of AliCPT.We present our results in Figure 7,where the blue

dashed and black solid lines represent the constraints with TB and EB $+$ TB estimator respectively. Our results show that,after3 years’observation,the AliCPTsarecapableof providing a stringent constraint onthe average rotation angle of $\sigma ( \alpha ) \sim 0 . 0 1 ^ { \circ }$ ：

# IV. SUMMARY

In this paper,we have provided an introduction to the AliCPT project and its scientific goals.After its completion, together with Chile and the SouthPole,AliCPTobservatory willbeone of the major CMB polarizationobservation stations in the world, realizing a full sky coverage in the search of the PGWs.
