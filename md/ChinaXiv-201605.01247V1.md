Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2) has been associated with a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders,such as autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability.However， it is largely unknown whether and how CHD2 is involved in brain development. Here,we demonstrate that CHD2 is predominantly expressed in Pax6+ radial glial cells (RGs) but rarely expressed in Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors (IPs). Importantly, the suppression of CHD2 expression inhibits the self-renewal of RGs and increases the generation of IPs and the production of neurons. CHD2 mediates these functions by directly binding to the genomic region ofrepressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), thereby regulating the expression of REST.Furthermore, the overexpression of REST rescues the defect in neurogenesis caused by CHD2 knockdown. Taken together， these findings demonstrate an essential role of CHD2 in the maintenance of the RGs self-renewal levels, the subsequent generation of IPs,and neuronal output during neurogenesis in cerebral cortical development, suggesting that inactivation of CHD2 during neurogenesis might contribute to abnormal neurodevelopment.

# INTRODUCTION

Neurogenesis is an essential process during embryonic cortical development that includes the proliferationand differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs).In the developing cortex,two major types of NPCs are found in the proliferative zones:Pax6+ radial glial cells (RGs) and Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors (IPs)．RGs,which are located in the ventricular zone (VZ),divide symmetrically to self-amplify or generate either a neuron or an IP via asymmetrical division[1,2]. IPs,which is mainly found in the subventricular zone (SVZ),divides symmetrically to generate neurons after one to three amplification divisions.Furthermore,the proliferation of progenitorcells is tightly regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors to control the development of the cerebral cortex.An abnormality in any process may result in improper brain development.For example，the overexpression of Trnp1(TMF1-regulated nuclear protein 1) in vivo increases the number of Pax6+ progenitor cells, whereas the knockdown ofTrnp1 increases the number of Tbr2+cells and induces folding of the cerebral cortex [3].Axin,an essential protein related with neurogenesis by interactingwith various signaling proteins,promotes the generation and amplification of IPs but has no significant effect on RGs [4]. Although an increasing number of molecules are involved in the proliferation of progenitors,how neurogenesis is regulated at the molecular and cellular levels during the development of the cerebral cortex remains largely unknown.

Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD) isamember of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling family and is crucial for both the assembly and regulation of chromatin.An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that the CHD protein plays instructive and programmatic roles during development [5]and mayact as a facilitator of lineage specification [6].For example,the loss of CHD5 blocks neuronal differentiation and results in an accumulation of undifferentiated progenitors [7],whereas CHD4 depletion promotes astrogenesis without affecting neuronal differentiation in the developing neocortex [8]. CHD7,a candidate gene of CHARGE (coloboma of the eye,heart defects,atresia of the choanae,severe retardation of growth and development，genital abnormalities,and earabnormalities) syndrome,promotes adult neurogenesis via stimulating the expression of the Sox4 and Sox11 genes [9]. CHD8,an autism susceptibility gene,also has an essential role in brain development [1O]. However, the functions of other CHD family members in embryonic cortical developmentareunclear.

CHD2 belongs to the CHD family of chromatin remodelers.CHD2-null mouse embryos demonstrate a general growth delay and die prior to birth,indicating that CHD2 plays important roles in mammalian development and long-term survival [11].Haploinsufficiency for CHD2 causes scoliosis and similar features of CHARGE syndrome，such as mental retardation [12]. Deletion of CHD2 in a child results in epilepsy and mental deficiency，indicating an essential role of CHD2 in brain function [13]. Moreover，CHD2 mutations might cause intellectual disability,autism,and epileptic encephalopathies [14-18].Although a subset of CHD family members play important functions in the maintenance of brain function and the development of the brain,very little is known regarding the role of CHD2 in embryonic neurogenesis.In addition,CHD2 mutations contribute toa broad spectrumof neurodevelopmental disorders,indicating that CHD2 might play an important function in the early development of the neocortex.

With this regard,we investigated the functions of CHD2 in mouse embryonic neurogenesis and explored the underlying molecular mechanism.We found that CHD2 is predominantly expressed in Pax6+ RGs but is rare in Tbr2+ IPs.The knockdown of CHD2 in the embryonic cortex decreases the amplification of RGs and promotes the generation of IPs.Furthermore,depletion of CHD2 results in their premature differentiation.The essential effect of CHD2 in embryonic neurogenesis is performed by stimulating the expression of REST.

# RESULTS

# Endogenous CHD2 is expressed in neurogenic regionsand specifically enriched in radial glial progenitors during cerebral cortical development

To investigate whether CHD2 plays an important role in embryonic neurogenesis,we first assessed the distribution of CHD2 in the developing forebrain from E12 to E18.The immunoreactivity of CHD2 was prominent in the nucleus of progenitors in the VZ/SVZ and of newborn neurons in the CP (Fig.1A,B,C;Supporting information Fig.1).Importantly，CHD2 was predominantly expressed in a subset of Pax6+ RGs (Fig.1D),whereas it was rarely expressed in ${ \mathsf { T } } { \mathsf { b } } { \mathsf { r } } 2 ^ { + }$ IPs (Fig.1E).To further demonstrate the expression of CHD2in RGs,we isolated neural progenitors from E12，E15,and E18 brains and cultured into neurospheres.RT-PCR results showed that the expression of CHD2 was down-regulated when Pax6,the RGs marker,reduced (Fig.1F). Simultaneously,CHD2 immunoreactivity was also detected in Sox2- positive cells and Nestin-positive progenitor cells (Fig. 1G，1H). Taken together，endogenous CHD2 is expressed in neurogenic regions and is abundant in RGs but largely absent in IPs during cerebral cortical development.

To confirm that CHD2 is also expressed in vitro,immunostainingstudieswereperformedonboth HEK293FT cells expressing Flag-tagged CHD2 and cultured neurospheres.Consistent with these studies, CHD2 was also expressed in the nucleus of HEK293FT cells and cultured neurospheres (Fig.1I,1J).Moreover, CHD2 was also co-expressed with Sox2,Pax6,and Nestin,demonstrating the expression of CHD2 in progenitors in vitro (Fig.1K).

# CHD2 isessential forthedevelopment of ne ocortex and the proliferation of progenitor cells

Given that the expression pattern suggested a potential role of CHD2 in embryonic neurogenesis,we investigated the function of CHD2 using in utero intraventricular microinjections.Three small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the 3'UTR or coding sequence of CHD2 mRNA were cloned into pSicoR.Western blotting analyses showed that these three shRNAs could effectively knock down the expression of CHD2 (Fig.3A).Moreoverthe expression of CHD2 was depleted in CHD2 shRNA electroporated cells (Fig.3B).To detect the role of CHD2 in embryonic neurogenesis， we electroporated CHD2- shRNA or control plasmid with a GFP-expressing vector into E13.5 cerebral cortices and detected the GFP distribution 3 days later.CHD2 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of GFP-positive cells in the VZ/SVZ. Consistent with these findings,the number of GFPpositive cells in the CP was clearly increased (Fig.2A, 2B).Moreover,CHD2 overexpression resulted in an accumulation of GFP-positive cells in the VZ/SVZ and a reduction of GFP-positive cells in the CP (Fig.2C,2D). Taken together, these results indicated that CHD2 plays anessential role during cortical development from E13.5 to E16.5,which is in the neuronogenetic interval starting on E10.5 and ending on 16.5 in mice.

Because the difference in GFP-positive cells was clearly observed in the VZ/SVZ，which is the region where progenitor cells are enriched,we hypothesized that CHD2 regulates the proliferation of progenitors in embryonic neurogenesis.To test this hypothesis，we injected BrdU into electroporated pregnant animals $2 h$ prior to euthanasia. Interestingly，CHD2 knockdown resulted ina significant reduction in BrdU incorporation at E16.5 (Fig.2E，2F)，whereas CHD2 overexpression resulted in more BrdU-positive cells compared to the control (Fig.2G,2H),suggesting that CHD2 is required for the proliferation of progenitors.

To further confirm the role of CHD2in the proliferation of progenitors,primary progenitors were infected with recombinant lentivirus expressing CHD2-shRNA or CHD2,and the proliferative capability of the cells was analyzed using EdU labeling.Consistent with these findingsin vivo， progenitorsinfectedwith CHD2- overexpressing lentivirus showed increased proliferation，whereas progenitors infected with CHD2-shRNA lentivirus exhibited reduced proliferation (Fig.3C,D,E,F). Moreover, the clones that were initially generated from asingle infected cell were much smaller in the CHD2- knockdown cells compared to the control (Fig.3G,3H).

Taken together, the data showed that CHD2 plays an essential role during cortical development,particularly in progenitor proliferation.Bothinvivo and in vitro results revealed that CHD2 promotes the proliferation of progenitors.

# CHD2 promotes the proliferation of RGs and inhibits the generation of IPs

There are two major types of progenitors,RGs and IPs, in the VZ/SVZ. How CHD2 regulates these two types of progenitors is unknown.For this purpose,we examined the proportion of $\mathsf { P a x 6 } ^ { + } \mathsf { G F P } ^ { + }$ cells and ${ \mathsf { T b r } } 2 ^ { + } { \mathsf { G F P } } ^ { + }$ cells. Consistent with the expression of CHD2 in a subset of Pax6+ cells,CHD2 knockdown significantly reduced the number of Pax6+ cells (Fig.4A,4D). Simultaneously, the number of Tbr2\* cells increased (Fig. 4C,4F). In contrast,CHD2 overexpression increased the number of Pax6+ cells (Fig.4B,4E). These results indicated that CHD2 is necessary for the self-renewal of RGs and the generation of IPs.

To further clarify the functional roles of CHD2 on RGs and IPs, the proliferation of RGs and IPs was assessed using BrdU labeling $2 h$ before the pregnant mice were euthanized.When CHD2 was knocked down,the amplification of RGs,which were Pax6+and BrdU+,was significantly reduced,whereas the proliferation of IPs, which were marked by Tbr2 and BrdU,has no significant variation (Fig.4G,H,I,J). Consistent with this finding,the amplification of RGs increased when CHD2 was overexpressed.These results showed that CHD2 promotes the proliferation of RGs but not of IPs.Moreover, cell-pair analysis in vitro showed that CHD2 knockdown in RGs decreased the number of RG-RG cell pairs, whereas the RG-IP cell pairs were increased (Fig.4K, 4L).These findings revealed that the knockdown of CHD2 inhibites the self-amplification of RGs and promotes the generation of IPs.

Taken together,these findings showed that CHD2 hasan essential role in the self-renewal and maintenance of radial glial progenitors during embryonic neu rogenesis.The magnitude of the CHD2 effectis substantial because its reduction promotes the generation of IPs and potentially the production of neurons.

# CHD2 knockdown promotes neuronal production

Because IPs are considered the major resource of neuronal production [1] and CHD2 knockdown promotes the generation of IPs，we investigated the effect of CHD2 on neuronal production. To this end, BrdU was administered 2 days later at E15.5 to trace the proliferated cells. At E16.5， the pregnant mouse was euthanized,and the embryonic brains were collected for analysis.The brain sections were stained with antibodiesfor GFP， BrdU， andKi67. Theratioof GFP+/BrdU+/Ki67+ cells was significantly reduced in the CHD2-knockdown brains. However， the percentage of GFP+/BrdU+/Ki67 cells that exited the cell cycle was significantly increased (Fig.5A,5B). Compared with control,more Tuj1+ neurons were detected in CHD2-shRNA lent virus infected groups in vitro (Supporting Information Fig.2A,2B).In support of these findings,more GFP+Tuj1+ cells were investigated in CHD2-knockdown brains,indicating that a reduction of CHD2 promotes neuronal production (Fig. 5C,5D).Taken together, these results revealed that more cells exited the cell cycle and differentiated into neurons when CHD2was knocked down. The effect of CHD2 on neuron production was further verified by BrdU birth dating experiment.The embryos were electroporated at E13.5,injected BrdU at E14.5 and collected at E18.5 (Fig.5E).At E18.5,most $\mathsf { G F P } ^ { + }$ cells were located in the CP in both control and CHD2-shRNA electroporated brains.Compared with control，more BrdU+GFP+ cells were observed in CP when CHD2 was knockdown (Fig.5F,5G). The result indicated that more progenitor cells were differentiated into neurons when CHD2 was reduced. Together，the knockdown of CHD2 inhibits the selfrenewal of RGs and subsequently promotes the generation of IPs and the production of neurons.

# CHD2 regulates embryonic neurogenesis by promoting the expression of REST

To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying CHD2 regulation in embryonic neurogenesis,the direct target gene of CHD2 that plays a role in embryonic neurogenesis needs to be identified.For this purpose,expression data trom the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) was analyzed. Interestingly, REST,RE1-Silencing Transcription factor，which is known as a neuronrestrictive silencer factor，is positively correlated with CHD2 expression.The expression of REST was obviously down-regulated from E12 to E15 (Fig. 6A),indicating a potential role of REST in neurogenesis.When CHD2 was knocked down,the expression of REST was also reduced (Fig. 6B),while the expression of REST was up-regulated when CHD2 is over expressed (Supporting Information Fig.1B),suggesting REST may be the candidate gene that is regulated by CHD2 during neurogenesis. Meanwhile,REST target genes,Celsr3,which is required for neurite growth [22],as well as Mash1 and Ngn2 [21, 23],which are lineage-specific genes，were detected. The expression of REST target genes was up-regulated by RNAi-mediated CHD2 knockdown， and downregulated by CHD2 overexpression (Suppporting Information Fig.1A,1C).To test whether REST overexpression in the developing neocortex might result in similar redistribution of electroporated cells as observed in CHD2 overexpression. REST overexpressing plasmid and control were electroporated. Similarly, the number of GFP-positive cells in the SVZ/VZ was increased,whereas the number of GFP-positive cells in the CP was significantly reduced when REST were overexpressed in the developing cortex (Fig. 6C, 6D). To test whether REST is a direct target gene of CHD2, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were performed in primary NSC to detect the binding of CHD2 to REST(Fig. 6E). The results showed that not only promoter but also coding region of REST were occupied by CHD2.When CHD2 was knocked down, the binding enrichment of REST was reduced (Fig. 6F),whereas more binding was detected in CHD2 overexpressing NSC (Fig.6G)． To identify the functional domain of CHD2 that regulates the expression of REST，FLAG-tagged CHD2 fragments and fulllength CHD2 were used for ChlP experiments. Results showed that CHD2 promotes the expression of REST through the chromatin-binding domain and the DNA binding domain (Fig.6H,6l).To further illustrate the relationship between CHD2 and REST in brain development,rescue experiments were performed with REST overexpression when CHD2 was silenced.As mentioned above,CHD2 knockdown decreased the percentage of $\mathsf { G F P } ^ { + }$ cells in the VZ/SVZ and increased the number of $\mathsf { G F P } ^ { + }$ cells in the CP.Importantly, the overexpression of REST rescued the abnormal distribution of $\mathsf { G F P } ^ { + }$ cells caused by CHD2 knockdown (Fig.7A,7B). Furthermore, the defect of RGs amplification caused by CHD2 knockdown could be rescued by REST overexpression (Fig.7C, 7D).This investigation suggested that CHD2 controls embryonic neurogenesis by regulating REST expression.

# DISCUSSION

Neurogenesis isan essential process for brain development that is generally accompanied by a gradual loss of progenitor potential and the appearance of specific neuronal traits [24].Thus,the maintenance of the progenitor pool is important for the persistent production of neurons.A reduced number of IPs caused by the precocious depletion of RGs ultimately results in the production of fewer neurons,resulting in a smaller cortex [25].In this study,we reported that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 plays an essential role in governing the neurogenic potential of progenitors.The depletion of CHD2 inhibits the self-renewal of RGs and subsequently promotes the generation of IPs and the production of neurons in the short-term.Both the decrease in the amplification of RGs and the increase in the transition from RGs to IPs contribute to the reduction of RGs when CHD2 is silenced. Taken together， our data demonstrated that CHD2 plays an important role in embryonic neurogenesis by maintaining theselfrenewal capacity of RGs and by preventing the precocious depletion of the progenitor pool.

We observed that CHD2 knockdown increased the number of IPs,whereas no significant effect on the amplification of IPs was observed when BrdU was administered $2 h$ later.The data indicated that the increase in IPs mainly resulted from the transition of RGs to IPs but not the self-amplification of IPs.In addition,CHD2 ex pression is largely absent in IPs,and the knockdown of CHD2 has no direct effect on IPs.Thus,our results demonstrated that CHD2 knockdown altered the composition of the progenitor pool,resulting in a relative decrease in RGs and an increase in IPs.This shift was further confirmed using cell pair analysis in vitro,which showed that CHD2 knockdown inhibit the amplification of RGs and promote the generation of IPs from RGs. Because RGs can self-renew and maintain the progenitor pool during cortical development,a decrease in RGs induced by CHD2 knockdown may result in a transient enlargement but a rapid depletion of the progenitor pool.

Chromatin regulators are commonly thought to facilitate lineage specification rather than be directly involved in the process [6].Although IPs are a major source of neuronal production,IPs are generated from RGs.Thus， the role of CHD2 on neuron production needs to be clarified.The suppression of CHD2 results in the generation of more IPs.Consistent with this finding, the number of cells exiting the cell cycle and labeled with Tuj1 was increased at E16.5,indicating that CHD2 reduction promotes neuronal differentiation.Thus,the transient increase in neuronal production was also a primary effect of CHD2 knockdown on the proliferation of RGs and the transition from RG to IPs.Simultaneously,CHD2 is also expressed in immature neurons.The other roles of CHD2 in neuronal differentiation remain unknown.

In the developing neocortex，neurogenesis occurs from E10.5 to E16.5.To study the role of CHD2 in neurogenesis,we electroporated target plasmids at E13.5 and analyzed the phenotype at E16.5.Our data demonstrated that CHD2 is a pivotal regulator of the selfrenewal of RGs as well as of the generation of neurons.

However,these results only reflect a snapshot of the progenitor pool at E16.5.Thus, to emphasize the functions of CHD2 in maintaining the size of the progenitor pool,tracing experiments need to be performed.

The binding of CHD2 to the REST genomic region suggests that it contributes to the silencing of neuronal genes in the proliferation stage but not in the differentiation stage.The role of REST in embryonic stem cell is controversial. Singh et.al showed that REST maintains the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells [21]. However,inconsistent results were put forward [26-28]. The discrepancy indicates that the function of REST is restricted by multiple factors.Yamada et.al found that REST promotes ESC differentiation but is not required for their maintenance [29].Soldati et.al showed that REST is not essential for production of radial glia-like progenitors but is required for their subsequent maintenance and neural differentiation [3O].As a repressor of neuronal genes,the expression of REST is downregulated in the transition from neural progenitor to neuronal differentiation during brain development [23,31,32]. The persistently expression of REST blocks the radial migration and delays neuronal differentiation [33].Furthermore,REST plays important role in neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation mediated by ZNF335 [34]. Recently,REST has been reported to play important functions in preventing cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease in the aged brain [35]. Briefly, REST isan essential regulator of neurogenesis during development and cognitive prevention during aging. In this study,we identified a new upstream regulator of REST, CHD2.The regulation of REST by CHD2 is not mediated by H3K4me3 modification (data not shown) but by binding to the genomic region of REST.In addition, the binding domain of CHD2 may be the chromatin and DNAbinding domains.Moreover，REST can rescue the abnormal cell distribution caused by CHD2 depletion. Thus,CHD2 regulates embryonic neurogenesis by promoting the expression of REST.

Interestingly，several studies have suggested that mutations in CHD2 contribute to a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders [14,15,36].For example,two mutations in the SNF2-related helicase/ATPase domain of CHD2 were correlated with epileptic encephalopathy.A CHD2 frameshift mutation was associated with intellectual disability.Mutations of CHD2 result in a broad spectrum of neurodevelopment disorders,indicating that CHD2 may play important functions during the early stage of brain development.Thus, the exploration of the role of CHD2 in embryonic neurogenesis is particularly well-suited for the study of CHD2-related diseases.

Taken together, the data show that CHD2 plays an essential role in maintaining the progenitor pool.The depletion of CHD2 may disturb the balance between the proliferation and differentiation of RGs and result in a rapid depletion of the progenitor pool.The regulatory function of CHD2 in embryonic neurogenesis may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenic disorders.

# CONCLUSION

In summary,we find that CHD2 is predominantly expressed in most ${ \mathsf { P a x 6 } } ^ { + }$ radial glial cells (RGs) but rarely expressed in ${ \mathsf { T } } { \mathsf { b } } { \mathsf { r } } 2 ^ { + }$ intermediate progenitors (IPs).In vivo evidences suggest that the suppression of CHD2 expression inhibits the self-renewal of RGs and increases the generation of IPs and the production of neurons. Furthermore,CHD2 mediates these functions by directly binding to the genomic region of repressor element1- silencing transcription factor (REST),thereby regulating the expression of REST.Our study clearly demonstrated the role of CHD2 in embryonic neurogenesis and brain development and may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.
