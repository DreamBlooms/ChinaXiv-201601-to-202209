# Epigenetic changes and functional study of HOXA11 in human gastric cancer

Aim: To examine epigenetic changes and the function of HOXA11 in human gastric cancer (GC).Materials & methods: Seven GC cell lines, five cases of normal gastric mucosa and 112 cases primary GC samples were used in this study.Results: Expression of HOXA11 and lack of promoter region methylation were found in NCl-N87, MKN45, BGC823 and HGC27 cells. Loss of expression and complete methylation were found in AGS gastric cancer cells. Reduced expression and partial methylation were found in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells. Restoration of HOXA11 expression was induced by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.HOXA11 was methylated in $8 1 . 2 5 \%$ (91/112) of primary GCs. The presence of methylation was associated with male gender, tumor size, tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis (all $\textsf { p } < 0 . 0 5 ;$ .Restoration of HOXA11 expression reduced cell proliferation,invasion,migration and induced apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest. HOXA11 was found to inhibit Wnt signaling by upregulating NKD1 expression. Conclusion: Epigenetic silencing of HOXA11 promotes GC proliferation, migration and invasion through activation of Wnt signaling.

Gastric cancer (GC)is the fourth most common malignancy and ranks the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world [1,2]. Salt,nitrite,alcohol, smoking and Helicobacter pylori infection were regarded as important risk factors [3].Even though aberrant genetic changes play critical roles, they are not enough to explain the mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis [4,5]. Epigenetics is becoming one of the important fields of cancer research.Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetics is involved in gastric carcinogenesis [6,7]．HOX genes are evolutionarily conserved genes encoding transcription factors that regulate mammalian embryonic development [8.9]. HOXA11 plays an important role in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation [1o,i1].Promoter region hypermethylation ofHOXA11 was found in different human cancers [12-15]. The epigenetic changes and the function of HOXA1l in human gastric cancer remain unclear.In this study, we analyzed the epigenetic regulation and the mechanism of HOXA1l in the development of human gastric cancer.

# Materials&methods

Primary GC samples

One hundred and twelve cases of GC samples were collected from the Chinese PLA General Hospital. The median age of cancer patients was 58.5 years (17-85 years). Tumor stage was classified according to TNM staging (NCCN2012)， including stage IIA $\left( \mathbf { n } = 4 \right)$ )，stage IIB ${ \bf \Psi } ( { \bf n } = 1 2$ ，stage IIIA $\left( { \mathfrak { n } } = 9 \right.$ ),stage IIIB ${ \bigl ( } \mathbf { n } = 4 8$ ),stage IIIC $( \mathbf { n } = 1 5 ^ { \cdot }$ )，stageIV ${ \mathrm { ( n ~ = ~ } } 2 4 { \mathrm { ) } } $ ).Fivecases of normal gastric mucosa were collected from noncancerous patients. All samples were collected according to the approved guidelines of the Chinese PLA General Hospital's institutional review board and kept at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

Cell culture & 5-aza $\cdot 2 ^ { \prime }$ -deoxycytidine treatment Seven GC cell lines were included in this study (AGS, NCI-N87,SGC7901，MGC803，BGC823,HGC27 and MKN45).The GC cell lines were established from primary human gastric adenocarcinoma cells previously and maintained in $9 0 \%$ RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, CA,USA),supplemented with $1 0 \%$ fetal bovine serum and antibiotics [16].GC cells were split to a low density ( $3 0 \%$ confluence) $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ before treatment, then treated with 5-aza $\cdot 2 ^ { \prime }$ -deoxycytidine (5-aza; Sigma, MO,USA) at a concentration of $2 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ in the growth medium,which was exchanged every $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ for total $9 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ treatment.At the end of the treatment course, RNAwas isolated as described below.

# RNA isolation & semiquantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated by Trizol reagent (Invitro gen, Carlsbad, USA). RNA quality and quantity were evaluated by $1 \%$ Agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric analysis.Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR(RT-PCR) was performed as described previously [17].RT-PCR primers were as follows:(F) $5 ^ { \prime }$ -GCAGCAGAGGAGAAAGAGCG $\cdot 3 ^ { \prime }$ and (R) $5 ^ { \prime } .$ GTGGATTTGCTGAGTAGTACTG-3'.

# DNA extraction,methylation-specific PCR & bisulfite sequencing

Genomic DNA from GC cell lines and GC tissue samples was prepared by proteinase-K method.Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing(BSSQ）were performed as described previously [18,19]．To obtain optimal conversion of cytosine to uracil by bisulfite treating, $1 ~ \mu \mathrm { g }$ genomic DNA was used,because increasing the amount of input DNA carried the risk of incomplete conversion and led to false-positive results [2o]． Sodium bisulfite treatedDNA should be treated as RNA and stored at ${ \cdot } 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to prevent further degradation.It is important to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Bisulfite sequencing was used to validate MSP result and provide complete CpG methylation information on all CpG-sites within the PCR product.

Each MSP reaction incorporated approximately 100 ng of bisulfite-treated DNA,25 pmoles of each primer, 100 pmoles dNTPs, $2 . 5 { \mathrm { u l } }$ $1 0 \times { \mathrm { P C R } }$ buffer and 1 unit of JumpStart Red Taq Polymerase (Sigma) in a final reaction volume of $2 5 ~ \mu \mu 1$ .Cycle conditions were: $9 5 ^ { \mathrm { o } }$ $\mathrm { ~ C ~ } \times 5 \mathrm { ~ m i n ~ }$ ； 35 cycles $\times$ $( 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \times 3 0 ~ s$ P $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \times 3 0 \ \mathrm { s } ,$ $7 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \times 3 0 \mathrm { ~ } s$ ） $7 2 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } } \mathrm { ~ C ~ } \times \mathrm { ~ 5 ~ }$ min.MSP products were analyzed using $2 \%$ agarose gel electrophoresis.To interpret the MSP results properly, positive,negative and H2O controls were included.MSP primers and BSSQ primers were designed around the transcriptional start site.To accomplish optimal discriminative power between methylated and unmethylated DNA,the primers should have a substantial number of non-CpG cytosines in the original template and contain one to three CpG dinucleotides in the 3'region of the primers [2o].The sequences of HOXA11 MSP primers were as follows: (UF) $5 ^ { \prime }$ -TGTGTGTGAAGTGATTTTTAGAGAGTAT $3 ^ { \prime }$ 、 $( \mathrm { U R } ) 5 ^ { \prime }$ -AAC AATCTCTATACACAAACTCCTCCA- $3 ^ { \prime }$ · (MF) $5 ^ { \prime }$ -TGCGCGAAGTGATTT TTAGAGAGTAC $\cdot 3 ^ { \prime }$ $( \mathrm { M R } ) 5 ^ { \prime }$ -CAATCTCTATACAC GAACTCCTCCG-3'.Primer sequences ofBSSQwere: $( \mathrm { F } ) 5 ^ { \prime }$ -GTTTYGGGTTTAGATTTTTTTAGT $\cdot 3 ^ { \prime }$ $( \mathrm { R } ) 5 ^ { \prime }$ -TAACCRAACTCTTAACCAACAC-3'.The unmethylated（U）primer will only amplify sodium bisulfite converted DNA in unmethylated condition,while the methylated (M) primer is specific for sodium bisulfite converted methylated DNA.Sample was regarded as unmethylation when PCR product was amplified only in unmethylation reaction and sample was regarded as methylation when amplified only in methylation reaction.Sample amplified in both unmethylation and methylation reaction was regarded as partial methylation.Since clinical tissue samples should be considered heterogeneous,both unmethylation and methylation amplicons can be expected.

# Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry (IHC） staining was performed in 45 cases of available matched cancer and adjacent noncancerous tissue samples.The procedure was performed as described previously [17]. Immunohistochemistry(IHC) was performed on $4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ thick serial sections derived from formaldehyde-fixed paraffin blocks of colorectal cancer and paired adjacent tissue.After deparaffinization and rehydration,endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ in methanol containing $0 . 3 \%$ hydrogen peroxide.After antigen retrieval,a cooling-off period of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ preceded the incubation with the primary antibody. Anti-HOXA11 Mouse Monoclonal (8B8) was diluted to 1/200 (LifeSpan BioScience,MD,USA),anti-p$\beta$ -catenin was diluted to $1 / 1 0 0$ (Bioword, Shanghai, China). The staining intensity and extent of the staining area were graded according to the German semiquantitative scoring system as described before [17,21,22]. Staining intensity of the nucleus,cytoplasm and/or membrane was characterized as follows: no staining $\mathbf { \varepsilon } = 0$ ,weak staining ${ \bf \omega } = 1 { \bf \gamma }$ ,moderate staining $= 2$ strong staining $= 3$ ; the extent of staining was defined as: $0 \% = 0$ ， $1 - 2 4 \% = 1$ ， $2 5 \mathrm { - } 4 9 \% = 2$ ， $5 0 { - } 7 4 \% = 3$ $7 5 - 1 0 0 \% = 4$ .The final immune-reactive score (0-12) was determined by multiplying intensity score by the extent of staining score.

HOXA11 expression plasmid construction The full length complementary DNA (cDNA) of HOXA11 was obtained byRT-PCR.The primers were as follows:HOXA11-EGFPN1-F: $5 ^ { \prime } .$ CGGAATTCATGGATTTTGATGAGCGTGGTCCCT $\cdot 3 ^ { \prime }$ ；HOXA11- EGFPN1-R: $5 ^ { \prime } .$ CGGGATCCCGGAGGAGTGGATTTGCTGAGTAG $\cdot 3 ^ { \prime }$ .Theproducts were subcloned into pcDNATM 3.1 expression vector.

# Transfection

AGS cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1-HOXA11 or the empty vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science,IN,USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.BGC823 cells were transfected with HOXA11- shRNA or scramble control using FuGENE 6(Roche Applied Science).

# Colony formation & cell viability detection

Cells were seeded at a density of 20oo cells/well in 6-well plates to grow for 2 weeks.Then cells were fixed with $7 5 \%$ ethanol for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ ,stained with $0 . 2 \%$ crystal violet (Beyotime,Nanjing, China） for $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ and then the number of clones was counted. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ cells/well, and cell viability was measured at 24, 48 and $^ { 7 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ using the MTT assy (KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Absorbance was measured on a microplate reader (Thermo Multiskan MK3,MA,USA) ata wavelength of $4 9 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ：

# Transwell assay for migration

The effect of HOXA1l on cell migration was detected by using Transwell Assay System (Corning,High Wyombe, UK). Cells were harvested and suspended in the serum-free medium and then placed into the upper well at a concentration of $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells $/ 2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ The complete medium with $2 0 \%$ fetal bovine serum was placed into the lower well $( 6 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l } )$ .The chamber was incubated for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ . The cells still on the upper surface were scraped gently and washed out with PBS for three-times.The cells migrated to the lower surface of the membrane were stained with crystal violet and counted in three independent high-power fields $( \times 2 0 0 )$ ：

# Transwell assay for invasion

A total of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ cells were suspended in $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ of serum-free medium and loaded onto the upper compartment of an invasion chamber containing a polycarbonate membrane with an $8 \mu \mathrm { m }$ pore size which was coated with a layer of extracellular matrix (ECM; MatrigelTM, BD,NJ,USA).After $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ of incubation, the invasive cells migrating through the ECM layer to the complete medium in the lower compartment were stained with crystal violet and the number of invasive cells was counted in three independent high-power fields $( \times 2 0 0 )$ ·

# Flow cytometry analysis

Cell phase distribution was examined as described previously[23]．Forapoptosisanalysis,Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (KeyGEN Biotech） was conducted according to manufacturer's instructions.

# Gene expressionarrayanalysis

RNA from HOXA1l unexpressed and re-expressed AGS cells was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Shanghai, China) and the expression was analyzed by expression array (Agilent Human $4 \times 4 4 \mathrm { k } .$ Bio Corporation, Beijing, China).

# Dual-Luciferase reporter assay

AGS cells were seeded at $2 \ \times \ 1 0 ^ { 4 } / \mathrm { w e l l }$ in 96-well plates and incubated for $2 4 \ \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .The method was describedpreviously [17]． To examine transcriptional activity driven by TCF/LEF,AGS cells were transfected with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / }$ well Topflash reporter vector (TCF/LEF-responsive reporter, containing $4 \times$ TCFbinding sites)；2 ng/well pRL-TK and pCI-neo- $\cdot \beta$ 1 catenin expressing vector $( 2 0 \mathrm { \ n g / w e l l } )$ were used to activate the reporter gene.As a negative control,another group of AGS cells were transfected with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { n g / w e l l }$ Fopflash reporter vector (containing mutant TCF/LEF binding sites), $2 ~ \mathrm { n g / }$ well pRL-TK control vector and $\beta$ -catenin expressing vector $\left( 2 0 \mathrm { \ n g / w e l l } \right)$ .To detect the effect of HOXA11 on $\beta$ -catenin/TCF luciferase reporter activity,pEGFP-HOXA1l and wild-type or mutant $\beta$ -catenin were cotransfected into AGS cell. Forty-eight hours after transfection,relative luciferaseactivities were measured with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega,Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each experiment was repeated for three-times. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t-test, $\mathrm { ~ p ~ < ~ } 0 . 0 5$ was considered as statistically significant difference.

# Western blot

Western blotting was performed as described previously [17]. Antibodies were diluted according to manufacturer's instruction.Antibodies employed were as follows:anti-HOXA11 Mouse Monoclonal (8B8) Antibody (LifeSpan BioScience,MD,USA)，rabbit antiCylin D1 (Bioworld Tech.,MN,USA),rabbit anti-cMyc(Bioworld Tech.),rabbit anti-Survivin (Bioworld Tech.),rabbit anti-mmp2(Bioworld Tech.),rabbit antimmp9 (Bioworld Tech.),rabbit anti-cyclinB1(Bioworld Tech.),rabbit anti- $\cdot \beta$ -catenin (Epitomics,CA, USA) and rabbitanti-p $\cdot \beta$ -catenin (CST,MA,USA).

# Statistical analysis

SPSS 17.0 software was employed. $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test and Student's t-test were used. Quantitative data were presented as the mean $\pm \ \mathrm { S D }$ .A p-value of less than O.05 was considered as statistical significance.

# Results

HOXA11 expression is controlled by promoter region methylation in human GC cell lines To examine the expression of HOXA1l,semiquantitative RT-PCR was employed. Expression of HOXA11 was found in NCI-N87,MKN45，BGC823 and HGC27 cells.Loss of expresson was found in AGS cells and reduced expression was found in MGC8o3 and SGC790lcells (Figure 1A). The methylation status of the promoter region was determined by MSP.Complete methylation was found in AGS cells and partial methylation was found in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells.No promoter region methylation was detected in NCI-N87, MKN45,BGC823 and HGC27 cells (Figure 1B).Lost/ reduced expression of HOXA11 correlated with the promoter region methylation status very well. Restoration of HOXA11 expression was induced by 5-AZA treatment in methylated cancer cells (Figure 1A). These results suggest that expression of HOXA11 was controlled by promoter region methylation.To further validate the specificity of the MSP studies,and to determine the methylation density in the promoter region, sodium bisulfite sequencing was performed in AGS,BGC823 and SGC790l cells. As shown in Figure 1B,sequencing results matched the MSP results well,with near complete,partial or absent DNA methylation.

HOXA11 was frequently methylated in human primary GCs & reduced expression correlates with promoter region hypermethylation HOXA1l was found to be methylated in $8 1 \%$ (91/112) of primary gastric cancers, while no methylation was found in five cases of normal gastric mucosa (Figure 1C). Methylation of HOXA11 was associated with male gender $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ ,tumor size $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ ,tumor differentiation $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 ) \$ ）and lymph node metastasis $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 ) ,$ ）， but no association was found with age and TNM stage (Table 1). To determine if there was an association of HOXA1l expression and promoter region methylation in primary human GCs,the expression of HOXA11 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in 45 cases using matched GCs and adjacent tissue. HOXA11 staining was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.In 45 cases of GC samples,absent or reduced expression was found in 37 cases.In 45 cases of adjacent tissue samples,absent or reduced expression was found in five cases.This suggests that the expression of HOXA1l was significantly reduced in GC samples compared with normal tissues $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 1D). However, of greatest importance was the correlation to promoter region DNA methylation.In the 37 cases of GC samples with absent or reduced levels of $H O X A I I$ （204号 expression,36 cases were found to be methylated.In contrast,no methylation was found in the other eight cases of GC which express HOXA11. Thus repression of HOXA11 was significantly associated with promoter region hypermethylation $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5$ ， $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test, Figure 1D).

# HOXA11 suppresses cell proliferation in AGS cells

To evaluate the effect of HOXA1 expression in gastric carcinomas,cell viability and colony formation were used with cell lines with different baseline expression of HOXA11. The colony formation decreased after restoration of HOXA11 expression in AGS cells $5 7 2 \pm 6 9$ versus

$1 1 6 \pm 3 0$ （ $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5$ ,Figure 2B). This difference suggests that colony formation was suppressed by HOXA11. This activity was further confirmed by shRNA knockdown in HOXA11 expressing BGC823 cells. The colony formation increased from $7 7 \pm 8$ to $2 8 1 \pm 2 1$ $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5$ 0 Figure 2A) after shRNA knockdown of HOXA11.

The cell viability was determined next using MTT. The OD value was $1 . 3 4 3 \ \pm \ 0 . 1 2 6$ versus $0 . 6 6 8 \pm \ : 0 . 0 9 8$ $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 ) ,$ ）before and after restoration of HOXA11 expression in AGS cells. The OD value was $2 . 5 3 6 ~ \pm ~ 0 . 3 4 2$ versus $1 . 5 8 2 \ \pm \ 0 . 1 8 1$ $\mathrm { ( p ~ < ~ 0 . 0 5 ) }$ before and after knocking down HOXA11 in BGC823 cells (Figure 2B). These results suggest that HOXA11 suppresses cell proliferation in GC cells.

# HOXA11 induced G2/M arrest in GC cells

To further analyze the effect of HOXA11 on gastric carcinogenesis， cell phase distribution was evaluated by flow cytometry in AGS cells before and after re-expression of HOXA11.As shown in Figure 2C, the distribution of cell phases in the AGS cell line with HOXA11 unexpressed and re-expressed were: phase $\mathrm { G 0 / 1 } \colon 3 8 . 9 6 \pm \ : 1 . 1 7 \%$ versus $3 4 . 7 8 \pm 3 . 5 7 \%$ ; S phase: $4 2 . 0 2 \pm 1 . 7 4 \%$ versus $2 7 . 1 3 \pm 5 . 8 0 \%$ ; G2/M phase: $1 9 . 6 8 \pm 2 . 3 4 \%$ versus $4 6 . 0 8 \pm 5 . 1 8 \%$ . The S phase was reduced significantly $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 ) ,$ ）and the $\mathrm { G } 2 / \mathrm { M }$ phase was increased significantly $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 ) ,$ .Tofurther validate these findings,shRNA knockdown technique was used in HOXA11 stably expressed BGC823 cells. The cell phase distribution,before and after knocking down HOXA1l,was as follows:Go/lphase: $5 7 . 2 2 \pm 0 . 0 7 \%$ versus $5 8 . 0 8 \pm 2 . 3 2 \%$ ; S phase: $1 9 . 4 2 \pm 0 . 0 5 \%$ versus $4 0 . 5 3 \pm 2 . 4 3 \%$ ; G2/M phase: $2 2 . 9 8 \pm 0 . 5 9 \%$ versus $1 . 3 8 \pm 0 . 1 4 \%$ (Figure 2C). S phase was increased significantly $\left( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ and the $\mathrm { G } 2 / \mathrm { M }$ （ $\mathrm { ( p < 0 . 0 5 ) }$ wasreduced significantly after knocking down HOXA11. These results suggest that HOXA11 induces G2/M phase arrest in GC.To further understand the mechanism, the expression of G2/M phase regulators,cyclinBl and cdc2,was examined by western blot before and after re-expression of HOXA11 in AGS cells. The expression of cyclin B1 and cdc2 was reduced after re-expression of HOXA1l (Figure 2C),providing an explanation for the observed cell cycle changes.

# HOXA11 induces apoptosis in human GC

To further understand the role of HOXAl1 in GC, apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The rate of apoptotic cells was $7 . 4 1 \pm 0 . 1 5 1 \%$ versus $1 2 . 0 1 \pm 1 . 7 3 \%$ before and after re-expression of HOXA11 in AGS cells （204号 $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5$ ，Figure 2D).Apoptosis related proteins,caspase-3 and survivin were detected by western blot. The expression of caspase-3 was increased and the expression of survivin was reduced obviously after re-expression of HOXA11 in AGS cells (Figure 2D).These results suggest that HOXA1l induced apoptosis in human GC.

# HOXA11 inhibits GC cell migration & invasion.

Since methylation of HOXA1l is associated with lymph node metastasis in primary GC,we explored the effect of HOXA1l on cell migration and invasion in GC cells. The number of migrating cells decreased from $2 5 0 ~ \pm ~ 1 2$ to $9 8 \pm 8$ $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ after re-expression of $H O X A I I$ in AGS cells.The number of invasive cells was also decreased from $1 4 2 \pm 2 0$ to $6 3 \pm 1 0$ $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ after re-expression of HOXA1l in AGS cells (Figure 3A). These effects of HOXA11 were confirmed by knocking down HOXA11 in BGC823 cells.As shown in Figure 3A, the number of migrating cells increased from $2 4 2 \pm 3 4$ to $8 2 7 \pm 2 4$ $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ cells and the number of invasive cells increased from $1 7 0 \pm 1 5$ to $3 5 6 \pm 2 1$ $( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ after knocking down HOXA11 in BGC823 cells (Figure 3B).

The mechanism by which HOXA11 altered cell migration and invasion was further explored by determining the expression of MMP2 and MMP9,proteins associated with disruption of extracellular matrix which promote metastases.The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 were both reduced after re-expression of HOXA11 in AGS cells (Figure 3C). These results further support the role of HOXA11 in suppression of cell migration and invasion in GC.

Isolation and identification of cancer-related genes regulated by HOXA11 in GC To understand the mechanism by which HOXA11 promotescarcinogenesis， gene expression microarray was used. The expression of 223 genes was increased and 117 genes was reduced by more than twofold in HOXA11 re-expressed AGS cells. Among these genes,56 were upregulated more than fourfold and 21 were down regulated more than fourfold (Figure 4A,Supplementary Table 1, see online at www. futuremedicine.com/doi/suppl/10.2217/epi.14.92). These changes in gene expression were further validated using RT-PCR.of greatest significance was the finding that NKD1 was consistently up-regulated by re-expression of HOXA1l in AGS cells (Figure 4B). Combined with Pathway Association Analysis (http:// david.niaid.nih.gov),we identified NKD1,a key component of Wnt signaling for further study.Upregulation of NKD1 was further determined by western blot. The effect of HOXA1l up-regulating NKD1 expression was also confirmed in the knockdown of HOXA11 in BGC823 cells (Figure 4B).

# HOXA11 inhibits Wnt/ $\beta$ -catenin signaling in GC cells

To confrm that HOXA1l involves Wnt signaling in GC development,TOPfash and FOPfash reporter systems were employed in this study. As shown in Figure 4C,the activity was reduced significantly by cotransfecting HOXA11 with wild-type or mutant $\beta$ -catenin with TOPfash reporter in AGS cells, but no changes were found by cotransfecting HOXA1l with $\beta$ -catenin and FOPflash reporter.

The expression of Wnt signaling downstream genes was next examined using western blot.As shown in Figure 4D,the expression of $\mathsf { c }$ -MycandcyclinD1were both reduced and phosphorylated $\beta$ -catenin (p $\cdot \beta$ catenin) was increased after re-expression of HOXA11 in AGS cells,even though the total $\beta$ -catenin level was not significantly changed (Figure 4D). The expression of p- $\cdot \beta$ -catenin was further evaluated in 45 cases of available matched primary human GC and adjacent tissue samples by IHC. p- $\cdot \beta$ -catenin staining was detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus.In 45 cases of adjacent tissue samples,36 cases were p- $\cdot \beta$ -catenin positive and nine cases were negative.In 45 cases of cancer tissue samples,six cases were p- $\cdot \beta$ -catenin positive and 39 cases were p $\cdot \beta$ -catenin negative (Figure 4E).

# Discussion

Homeobox sequences encode the 60-amino-acid homeodomain,with a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif [25].In mouse and man, there are approximately 200 homeobox genes,with the 39 most homologous to the Drosophila homeotic genes located in four clusters (HOXA,HOXB,HOXC and HOXD) and termed Hox genes [26].HOXA11 is located in chromosome 7p15.2,a region frequently deleted in human cancers [27-29].Larger deletions of the HOXA gene cluster (HOXA1-HOXA13) result in hand-foot-genital syndrome in combination with other malformations such as velopharyngeal insufficiency and a persistent patent ductus botalli [30].A single HOXA11 truncating mutation has been reported to cause a specific syndrome with skeletal defects and amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia [31]. HOXA11 methylation was reported in different cancers,and methylation of HOXA1l has been proposed as an early detection marker in breast cancer [32] and a poor prognostic marker in ovarian cancer [12].In a Phase II clinical trial, decitabine demethylation of HOXA11 restored sensitivity to platinum in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [33]. Bai et al. reported that HOXA11 expression was silenced in human GC [34].In this study,we found that HOXA11 was frequently methylated in human GC and expression of HOXA1l was regulated by pro moter region methylation.Methylation of HOXA11 was associated with male gender, large tumor size, poor tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis.HOXA1l suppressed GC cell proliferation,invasion and migration and induced apoptosis.We found NKDI,a key component of Wnt signaling [35]，was upregulated by HOXA11 in GC cells, suggesting Wnt signalingas a pathway through which HOXA11 mediates these effects.In mice,HOXA11 has previously been shown to interact with Wnt signaling in regulating female reproductive tract development [36]. We demonstrate that HOXA11 was indeed inhibits Wnt signaling as demonstrated with a Luciferase reporter assay in human GC cells. The inhibiting role of HOXA11 in Wnt signaling was further confirmed by detecting the expression of Wnt signaling downstream genes in GC cells,as well as by evaluating HOXA11 and p- $\cdot \beta$ -catenin staining in human primary GC. Thus,HOXA1l suppresses GC growth and metastasis by inhibiting Wnt signaling.

In primary tumors,quantitative methylation analysis can be considered,however,all samples retain detectable unmethylated DNA which is derived from normal tissue contamination and unmethylated tumor cells in tumors with altered DNA methylation.Thus, distinguishing the degree of methylation present is often more a measure of tumor cellularity than any functional measure of silencing. For this reason, we have not distinguished a level of methylation,but compared the presence of methylation to expression to demonstrate functional consequences of this alteration.This may alternatively have been done by realtime MSP with the establishment of cutoffs.Some genes can become aberrantly methylated during cell culture. While, our purpose is to explore the consequences of DNA methylation on silencing and downstream phenotypes in human GC.Promoter region methylation is found in 91 of the 112 primary GCs, suggesting that this is not solely a cell culture change.

In addition to $5 \mathrm { m C }$ (5-methylcytosine),reduction in 5hmC (5-hydroxymethylcytosine) was well reported in a number of cancers and cell lines corresponding to prostate,breast,colon,lung,brain, liver,kidney and melanoma,compared with the associated normal tissue [37-41].But the level of 5hmC is highly variable and unreproducible [39,42].It was undetectable in some human cancer tissues and cells [43]. 5hmC of HOXA11 was not detected in this study.The mechanism of 5hmC in human GC in HOXA1I remains need to be elucidated.

The regulation of HOX gene expression has been a model to study the establishment and maintenance of heritable transcriptional states during development [44]．Polycomb(PcG）and trithorax（TrxG）proteins maintain appropriate HOX expression.The PRC2 complex trimethylates H3K27(me3) [45] and bind to the same histone mark that is essential for inheritable long-term repression of target genes [46]. Recruitment of PRC1 members to $\mathrm { H } 3 \mathrm { K } 2 7 \mathrm { m e } 3$ further facilitates gene silencing.While, TrxG/MLL protein complexes catalyze the trimethylation of H3K4,which is generally associated with active transcription [47]. The regulation of HOXA11 expression by histone modification remain unclear. To better understand the mechanism of HOXA1l expression regulating, it is necessary to analyze the promoter region histone modification status in GC.

# Conclusion

HOXA11 is frequently methylated in human GC and the expression of HOXA11 was regulated by promoter region methylation. Restoration of HOXA1l expression suppressed cell proliferation,migration and invasion,as well as induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. HOXA11 suppresses GC growth by inhibiting Wnt signaling. HOXA11 methylation is a potential GC detection and prediction marker.HOXA11 is a Wnt signaling inhibitor that could become a therapeutic target in GC.

# Future perspective

HOXA1l methylation is a potential gastric cancer detection and prediction marker， prognosis. As HOXA11 is a Wnt signaling inhibitor, it is possible become a gastric cancer therapeutic target.
