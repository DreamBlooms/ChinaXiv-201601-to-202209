An experimental investigation has been carried out with aa point focusing dish reflector of 12 square meters aperture area, exposed to the average direct normal irradiations of $8 1 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ .This work focuses on enhancinge the energyand exergy eficiencies of thecavity receiver by minimizing the temperature diffrence between the wall and heat transfer fluids. Two heat transfer fluids Water and $\mathrm { S i C + }$ water nano fluid have been prepared from 50 nm particle size and $1 \%$ of volume fraction,and experimented separately for the flow rates of $0 . 2 \mathrm { l p m }$ to $0 . 6 \mathrm { l p m }$ with an interval of $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ . The enhanced thermal conductivity of nano fluid is $0 . 8 0 0 1 1 5 \ \mathrm { W / m K }$ with the $k _ { e f f } / k _ { b }$ （204号 ratio of 1.1759 determined by using the Koo and Kleinstreuer correlation.The maximum atained energy and exergy efficiencies are $2 9 . 1 4 \%$ and $2 4 . 8 2 \%$ for water, and $3 2 . 9 1 \%$ and $3 9 . 8 3 \%$ for $\mathrm { S i C + }$ water nano fluid. The nano fluid exhibits enhanced energy and exergy efficiency of $12 . 9 4 \%$ and $6 0 . 4 8 \%$ than that of water at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ .The result shows that the system with $\mathrm { S i C + }$ Water produces higher exergy efficiency as compared to energy efficiency; in the case of water alone,the energy efficiency is higher than exergy efficiency.

# Introduction

The concentrated solar power generation and its applications are in center of attraction for the researchers, which need more research and development efforts in materials and technologies, towards achieving the maximum possible energy and exergy efficiencies. Compare with trough and tower collectors based on technological viewpoint, the parabolic dish collector occupies less area and suits for small and medium scale applications with high temperature output. David Barlev et al. [1] discussed about the advantages of parabolic dish collectors with tracking in solar thermal power conversion,the concentration ratio can reach 1OoO by minimizing the receiver size. Tian and Zhao et.al.[2] reviewed about present and proposed solar power plants,heat transfer fluids,categories of storage materials for sensible heat, latent heat,and chemical storages with heat transfer en hancement techniques.The effects of optical error, rim angle and heat loss coefficient were discussed by Huairui Li et al.[3],which relates the heat loss rate to the annual average solar radiation,for cavity receivers with and

without window.In this work the preferred rim angle and the optical error of the parabolic dish reflector to achieve optimum intercept factor and absorptivity for the cavity receiver are discussed.The preferred rim angle for the cavity receiver without window should be more than $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ with less than $4 \mathrm m$ radius of optical error,whereas for the windowed one the recommended rim angle must be less than $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ and the optical error value may lie above $4 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ radius.

Steinfeld and Schubnell [4] described a method named semi empirical approach to optimize the radius and the temperature ranges of the receiver for parabolic collectors.The absorption efficiencies are high when the temperature is below $7 0 0 \mathrm { K }$ (the efficiency is $100 \%$ at $3 0 0 \mathrm { K }$ and for $8 \ \mathrm { c m }$ radius） for bigger radius of the absorber, which interceptsall thereflected solarradiationsfrom the parabolic dish;whereas above $7 0 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ ，it reduces and keeps constant regardless the variation of the absorber radius,(the absorption efficiency reduces to $50 \%$ at 1700 K and $0 \%$ at $2 0 1 9 \mathrm { K }$ for the same 8 cm absorber radius), because bigger radius lead to significant increase in the radiative losses at higher temperatures.Mathew Neber et.al[5] experimented a point focusing dish collector for residential (small) scale applications to generate electricity with Brayton cycle by reaction bonded SiC material (with higherthermal conductivityandemissivity/ absorptivity)for the receiver withdiameter of $7 2 \mathrm { m m }$ and reflector of 17 square meters,which has been proved more suitable for smaller scale CSP systems to withstand the temperature of $1 7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ with the generating output of $2 . 5 \mathrm { k W }$ through higher concentration of 4175 suns（1000 $\mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ of $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { D N I } } = \boldsymbol { \mathrm { 1 } }$ sun).Isabel Roldan et al [6] made thermal analysis by CFD software FLUENT through 3D, RNG, K-ε turbulence model with geometries of square, cylindrical (tube)，with compositions of five different refractories for several wall thickness of refractory, insulation and frame arrangement. The best geometry among themwascylindrical(tube)withbaffleplated,whichwas made byrefractorymaterial composition of $5 3 . 4 3 \%$ of $\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 }$ $\mathrm { ~ O } _ { 3 }$ ， $3 9 . 6 \%$ of $\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ ， $1 . 1 \%$ $\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ， $1 . 6 \%$ of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ and $3 . 3 \%$ of CaO.The better thermal gradient between wall and heat transfer fluid was achieved for the refractory wall thickness of $1 5 \mathrm { c m }$ and insulation thickness of $1 5 \mathrm { c m }$ and frame thickness of $5 \mathrm { c m }$ ,with the maximum fluid temperature of $1 3 5 0 \mathrm { K }$ at the central section.

The research on directional characteristics of focal flux was carried out by Shuai Yong et al [7] through Monte-Carlo Ray-Tracing method coupled with the optical properties of the plano-convex quartz window. This analysis reveals,the efficiency of the quartz windowed cavity receiver is higher than the windowless one,when the reference temperature is higher than the critical temperature $( 8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } )$ . The quartz window distributes the radiative flux uniformly throughout the cavity absorber and hence the temperature distribution on the receiveris also found uniform,which in turn reduces thelossesof radiation and wall emissivity resulting better thermal efficiency.Reddy et al.[8] developed a modified receiver model to achieve anaveragethermal efficiencyof $74 \%$ for the flowrate of 25O liters per hour,which may suit for steam generation applications. The maximum energy and exergy efficiencies found for a cylindrically coiled tubular receiver withairas heat transfer fluid were $82 \%$ and $28 \%$ respectively based on the maximum gained thermal energy and exergy rates of $2 1 . 3 \mathrm { k W }$ and $8 . 8 ~ \mathrm { k W } _ { ; }$ respectively,byJianqin Zhu etal.[9].

Xiang-Qi Wang et al. [1O] made a review on the heat transfer characteristics of nano fluids by experimental studies and analytical models with more attention to thermal conductivity. The heat transfer performance of $80 \%$ Was achieved for water based copper nano fluid with $10 \%$ volume fraction and $100 \%$ for oil based carbon nano tubes of $1 \%$ volume fraction.Applications of nano fluids in solar energy was reviewed by Omid Mahian et al.[11] through the results of experimental and numerical studies, about the enhancements of efficiency in the performance of solar energy systems,this review paper focuses on the improvements of collector efficiency based on increasing the particle size in nano meter range and selecting suitable volume fraction (the maximum efficiency may be at $1 \% )$ ）by experiments.The heat transfer enhancement in silicon carbide (SiC)/water nano fluid of $1 7 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ with $3 . 7 \%$ volume concentration was experimented by Wenhua Yu et al.[12]. The results on the convective heat transfer coefficient had increased in between 5O to $60 \%$ above the base fluid(water) for constantReynoldsnumber,regarding the merit parameter, O.8 for silicon carbide (SiC)/water nano fluidand O.6 for $\mathrm { { A l } } _ { 2 } \mathrm { { O } } _ { 3 }$ /water.

Said et al.[13] made a review about the increase of radiative properties and high absorption for more storage capacities at higher temperatures.The investigations discussed Nano particles of carbon nano horns,graphite and silver with base fluid like water, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and therminol VP-1 in heat transfer applications.The review work also studied scattering of rays, radiative heat transfer and other above-mentioned properties of nano fluid which depend on size, shape structure and volume fractions with respect to the surfactant used. The study also explored that around $5 0 \mathrm { n m }$ range particle size with volume fractions of ${ { 1 0 } ^ { - 5 } }$ to ${ { 1 0 } ^ { - 2 } }$ is more suitable for solar energy conversion applications.A volumetric receiver's efficiency of more than $3 5 \%$ was obtained through the direct absorption,and thermal re-emission of carbon coated nano fluid with optimized optical thickness to enhance the radiative properties was discussed by Andrej Lenert and Evelyn Wang [14].Elias et al.[15] experimented and proved the enhancements in thermal conductivity,overall heat transfer coefficient andheat transfer rate by using the nano fluid of boehimate alumina nano particles with ethylene glycol and water through different shapes (cylindrical ,brick,platelets and blades) and volume fractions.Also from the experimental results the cylindrical shaped nano particle with $1 \%$ volume fraction showed better overall heat transfer coefficient compared to other particle shapes.

The important conclusions from the results of the reviewed literatures clearly indicate that the overall performance of the collector system can be improved by minimizing the convective and radiative heat losses through proper selection of geometry,heat transfer fluid with optimum heat transfer properties (volume fraction and particle size of nano fluid) and material for the receiver. In this regard a cavity type receiver was designed and fabricated using aluminium material and $\operatorname { S i C + W } ;$ ater nano fluid was selected to study the performance of the CSP system.In this work the energy and exergy efficiencies with exergy factor of the cavity receiver have been compared for two heat transfer fluids,Water and $\mathrm { S i C \Sigma + }$ water nano fluid.

# Experimental method

# Experimental setup

The experiment has been carried out between 12:30 h and $1 4 { : } 3 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，atMelmaruvathur( $1 2 ^ { \circ } 3 0 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { N }$ latitude and $7 9 ^ { \circ } 3 0 ^ { \prime } \mathrm { E }$ longitude) near the city of Chennai in India. The point focusing reflector made by glass mirror with reflectivity of $93 \%$ and reflector area of 12 square meters was fabricated with the rim angle of $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ for the focal length of $2 . 1 6 \mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ The cavity receiver of no window type was selected to achieve better interception factor and performance,where the working temperature is below $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ The length to diameter ratio of 1.5（ $\mathrm { \Delta L } / \mathrm { D } = 1 . 5 \$ ）forthe receiver with the concentration ratio of 381.97 was designed and fabricated with aluminium material. The bigger diameter of $1 6 \mathrm { c m }$ for the cavity has been selected to absorb all the reflected solar radiations,where the radiative losses (below $( 7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } )$ arevery little. The receiver with inner and outer diameters of $1 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m m } }$ and $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m m } }$ for the length and cavity depth of $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m m } }$ and $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ has been given to effectively absorb the Direct Normal Irradiations (DNI). The helically coiled copper tube with 12 number of turns,dimensions of $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ inner and 12 mm outer diameter is arranged between the inner and outer walls up to the length of $3 / 4$ th of the receiver. The performance of the cavity receiver has been studied for enhancements in conduction，convection and radiation modes ofheattransfers withtwo heat transferfluids;the entire external wall surface has been insulated with thickness of $5 0 \pm 0 . 5 \mathrm { m m }$ asbestos material.

The components of entire experimental setup with flow paths and data acquisition are shown in the schematic diagram. The DNI from the sun was measured bya solarimeter, accuracy of $\pm 1 \ \mathrm { \textrm { W } } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ with least count of

$1 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ and working ranges of $0 { - } 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { W / m } ^ { 2 }$ ,respectively. The temperature measurements were monitored and recorded for every five minutes by $\mathrm { \Delta K }$ -type thermocouplesin different locations on the receiver as shown in the diagram, the thermocouples ${ \mathrm { T } } _ { 1 }$ ， $\mathbf { T } _ { 2 }$ ${ \mathrm { T } } _ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { T } _ { 4 }$ measure the temper atures of the top,middle,and the bottom wall temperatures of the cavity receiver,whereas the inlet and outlet temperatures of the fluids (water or $\mathrm { S i C + }$ water nano fluid) are measured by the thermocouples Tin and Tout which are mounted on the top and bottom of the fluid paths, respectively. The data acquisition is accomplished by the National Instruments data acquisition system with the support of Lab VIEW software.The heat transfer fluid was pumped into the receiver from the top by a booster pump of nominal flow rate of $1 . 8 \mathrm { l p m }$ and maximum inlet pressure of 6O PSI and the flow rates were measured through a Rota meter of range $0 { - } 2 ~ \mathrm { l p m }$ . The estimated uncertainties through propagation of error method for energy and exergy rates with respect to flow rates and temperatures are $\pm 1 \%$ and $0 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ respectively. The energy and exergy analysis have been done for the steady solar radiations time period of 12.30 to $1 4 . 3 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,from the best acquired data of 14 days during the month of June,in the year of 2016.

# Nano fluid characterization

Based on the literature survey, the particle size,volume fraction and the heat transfer properties like viscosity, thermal conductivity,and convective heat transfer coefficient have been condideredin this work to enhance the energy and exergy efficiencies of the collector system. The particle size and distribution in the suspension with surfactant used are the major factors in the agglomeration of particles.The selected particle size and volume fraction based on the literatures were $5 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ and $1 \%$ from the effective values of $2 0 \mathrm { - } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and $1 \% - 4 \%$ [11,12] in particle size and volume fraction respectively. This work aims to study the conductive,convective and radiative modes of heat transfers in the cavity receiver by heat transfer fluids(Water,SiC+Water）with respect to the

geometry.

$$
\mu _ { n f } = \mu _ { w } + \left( 1 + 0 . 2 5 \phi \right)
$$

The viscosity of the nano fluid $( \mu _ { n f } )$ which causes the pressure drop and thus requires more pumping power [11] was carefully estimated to be low by selecting the SiC volume fraction of $1 \%$ andparticle size of $5 0 ~ \mathrm { \ n m }$ through dispersant (surfactant) of Triton $\textsuperscript { X } - 1 0 0$ .with weightpercentage of $1 ( 1 \% )$ [16,17].Figs.2 and3 show the SEM image with quantitative results of SiC particles, respectively.

# Thermal conductivity of nano fluids from the Koo andKleinstreuercorrelation

Generally the thermal conductivity of nano fluids are determined by experiments or by simulation models and also from correlations,here it is calculated from selected semi empirical correlations,actually thermal conductivity of nano fluid is based on the thermal conductivities of particle and base fluid with respect to the other considerations like particle size，volume fraction,particle disper sion and stability of the fluid considering the surfactant used,temperature applied, interaction between particles, convective heat transfer coefficient from surrounding particles to base fluid due to Brownian movement, interfacial thermal layer,Reynold's number,Prandtl number andRaleigh's scattering.Empirical correlations of Max well,Bruggman,Prasher,Koo and Kleinstruer and simulations of Bhattacharya and Xuan-Yao studied based on the present needed parameters [1O,11 &18].

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { { k _ { e f f } } = { k _ { s t a t i c } } + { k _ { B r o w n i a n } } } } \\ { { { k _ { e f f } } = \displaystyle \frac { { k _ { p } } + 2 { k _ { b } } + 2 \left( { k _ { p } } - { k _ { b } } \right) \phi } { { k _ { p } } + 2 { k _ { b } } - { \left( { k _ { p } } - { k _ { b } } \right) } \varphi } } } \\ { { + 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \beta \varphi \rho _ { \varphi } \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { { k _ { b } } } { C _ { p } } \sqrt { \frac { { k _ { \beta } } T } { { \rho _ { p } } d } } f \left( T , \varphi \right) } } \end{array}
$$

The effective thermal conductivity $( k _ { e f f } )$ of the nano fluid is the sum of static thermal conductivity $( k _ { s t a t i c } )$ of nano fluid,which basically depends on the thermal conductivity of the base fluid $( k _ { b } )$ and the effect of Brownian movement $( k _ { B r o w n i a n } )$ [17].The effective thermal conductivity and the ratio of $( k _ { e f f } / \ k _ { b } )$ have been calculated as $0 . 8 0 0 1 1 5 4 \ \mathrm { W / m K }$ and 1.1759 respectively, through the correlation byKoo andKleinstreuer,which considers both Maxwell correlation and Brownian motion with the effects of volume fraction,particle size,and temperature.

$$
\rho _ { n f } = \rho _ { p } \varphi + \left( 1 - \varphi \right) \rho _ { w }
$$

$$
C _ { p n f } = \frac { { \left( 1 - \varphi \right) } { \left( { \rho C _ { p } } \right) } _ { w } + \varphi { \left( { \rho C _ { p } } \right) } _ { p } } { \rho _ { n f } }
$$

The value of $\beta$ is assumed as O.1,which is the ratio of thickness of nano layer to radius of nano particle.Theoretically the determined values of specific heat capacity $( C _ { p n f } )$ and density $( \rho _ { n f } )$ of nano fluid were also verified through energy balance from experiments.The density and specific heat capacity of nanofluid were determined through the above correlations based on the specific heat capacities $( C _ { p } ) _ { p }$ ，densities $( r _ { p } )$ with respect to the volume fraction $( \phi )$ of the nano particle and the specific heat capacities $( C _ { p } ) _ { w }$ ，densities $( \rho _ { w } )$ of the base fluid(water) respectively[12].

# Convective heat transfer in nano fluid through experimental calculations

In this work the values of convective heat transfer coefficient,Reynolds numbers (Re) andNusselt numbers $( N u )$ are[12,19] determined through experimental data of averagereceivertemperature,massflowrateforwaterand $\mathrm { S i C + }$ water nano fluid temperatures.

$$
N u = \frac { h _ { \mathrm { e x p } } D _ { h } } { k _ { e f f } }
$$

Where $h _ { \mathrm { e x p } }$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient of the heat transferfluids (waterand nano fluid), $D _ { h }$ is the hydraulic diameter, $K _ { e f f }$ is the thermal conductivity of the nano fluid.The determined values ofNusselt numbers for the flow rates of $0 . 2 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ to $0 . 6 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ for both the heat transfer fluids have been studied, the maximum Nusselt number value for the $\mathrm { S i C + V }$ Waternano fluid is $1 3 . 7 7 \%$ higher than that of water at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ =

# Energy and Exergy Analysis

The thermal performance of the cavity receiver system has been studied through experimental data by means of applying energy and exergyanalysis (first and second law of thermodynamics） for two heat transfer fluids.This work focuses on enhancing the thermal energy efficiency and the exergy factor (maximum energy quality） of the collector system. The temperature difference between wall and HTFs has impact on exergy factor [9],hence the geometry of cavity receiver and heat transfer fluids (water, $\mathrm { S i C + }$ water nano) are selected to enhance the conductive, convective and radiative modes of heat transfer. The conclusion from literatures reveals that importance should be given to the selection of solar collector system to improve the exergy efficiency,hence rather than the flat plate collectors,other collectors（glass widow covered or coated cavity receivers with heating device called reflectors) are preferred to avoid exergy destruction [2O]. The energy and exergy analyses give an understanding about the relationship between the system performance and technical characteristics like reliability,sustainability,availability, maintenance and environmental impacts [21]. In this experimental worka dish reflector and cavityreceiverhave been taken up to analyze the energy and exergy efficiencies,to maintain the system in constant heat flux.

The performance of the cavity solar receiver has been characterized by analyzing the energy and exergy parameters through the solar dish reflector of $1 2 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { \bar { 2 } }$ which focuses the DNI of the sun by a manually operated tracking system. The point focusing collector is closely monitored for uniform and constant heat flux on the cavity absorber during the experiment period of 14 days with the two different heat transfer fluids (water, $\mathrm { S i C + }$ Water nano), separately for the flowrates of $0 . 2 \mathrm { l p m }$ to $0 . 6 \mathrm { \ l p m }$ with an interval of $0 . 1 \mathrm { l p m }$

# Energy analysis

The absorber of the cavity receiver receives entire energy from the direct normal irradiations (DNI) through the focused radiations by the dish reflector from the sun. The solar power on the reflector as [9]:

$$
E _ { s } = A _ { r e f } I
$$

Where $A _ { r e f }$ is the area of the reflector and I denotes the direct beam or direct normal irradiation.The energy focused on the cavity receiver is based on the optical efficiency $( \eta _ { o p } )$ ，which is based on the optical properties and the concentration ratio (reflector area /receiver).

$$
E _ { a } = \eta _ { o p } E _ { s } = \left( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \right)
$$

The rate of power or the power received by the receiver from the two different heat transfer fluids (water, $\mathrm { S i C + }$ water nano） during the experiments

$$
E _ { R } = \dot { m } c _ { a \nu } \left( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \right)
$$

The mass flow rates $( \dot { \mathsf { m } } )$ for the average specific $( c _ { a \nu } )$ heat of the heat transfer fluids are based on the average temperature of the receiver. The energy conservation or the gained energy is the difference between focused DNI (heat flux) on the absorber $( E _ { a } )$ and the heat losses $( E _ { L } )$ from the receiver. The receiver energy gain $( E _ { R } )$ , can be expressed as

$$
E _ { R } = E _ { a } - E _ { L }
$$

$$
E _ { L } = U _ { L } A _ { \mathrm { R e } f f } \left( T _ { a \nu g } - T _ { a t m } \right)
$$

The energy balance for the receiver based on the absorber and heat transfer fluid is considered by the overall loss coefficient or heat loss factor $( U _ { L F } )$ （204号

$$
U _ { L F } = U _ { L } A _ { \mathrm { R e } f f }
$$

$$
\dot { m } c _ { a \nu } \left( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \right) = \eta _ { o p } A _ { r e f } I - U _ { L F } \left( T _ { a \nu g } - T _ { a t m } \right)
$$

Thermal efficiency of the receiver is the ratio of heat (power) gained by the receiver to the concentrated heat flux (power) on the cavity area of the receiver by the dish reflector

$$
\eta _ { t h R } = \eta _ { E n R } = \frac { E _ { R } } { E _ { a } } = \frac { \dot { m } c _ { a \nu } \left( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \right) } { \eta _ { o p } A _ { r e f } I }
$$

Fig.4Solar dish reflectorand receiver

# Exergy analysis

The solar exergy rate by the sun to the dish reflector then to the receiver is expressed as [9]

$$
E _ { x S - D } = \eta _ { o p } \left[ A _ { r e f } \left( 1 + \frac { 1 } { 3 } \Bigg ( \frac { T _ { a t m } } { T _ { s } } \Bigg ) ^ { 4 } - \frac { 4 } { 3 } \Bigg ( \frac { T _ { a t m } } { T _ { s } } \Bigg ) \right) \right]
$$

The exergy rate,which is the quality of useful energy to the HTFs by the receiver with respect to the surroundings, is expressed by the following relationship

$$
E _ { x R } = \dot { m } c _ { a \nu } \Bigg [ \left( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \right) - T _ { a t m } \ln { \left( \frac { T _ { o u t } } { T _ { i n } } \right) } \Bigg ]
$$

The energy absorbing capacity or the energy conversion ability of the thermal system is termed as exergy efficiency of the cavity receiver,which is expressed as the ratio of output exergy from the receiver to the exergy supplied to the receiver through the dish reflector.

$$
\begin{array} { c c l } { \eta _ { E _ { x R } } = \displaystyle \frac { E _ { x R } } { E _ { x S - D } } } \\ { = \displaystyle \frac { \dot { m } c _ { a v } \Bigg [ \Big ( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \Big ) - T _ { a t m } \mathrm { l n } \Bigg ( \displaystyle \frac { T _ { o u t } } { T _ { i n } } \Big ) \Bigg ] } { \eta _ { o p } \Bigg [ A _ { r e f } \Bigg ( 1 + \frac { 1 } { 3 } \Bigg ( \displaystyle \frac { T _ { a t m } } { T _ { s } } \Bigg ) ^ { 4 } - \frac { 4 } { 3 } \Bigg ( \displaystyle \frac { T _ { a t m } } { T _ { s } } \Bigg ) \Bigg ) \Bigg ] } } \end{array}
$$

The exergy factor is the ratio of exergy rate to energy rate of the cavity receiver.

$$
E _ { x F } = \frac { E _ { x R } } { E _ { R } } = \frac { \dot { m } c _ { a \nu } \Bigg [ \left( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \right) - T _ { a t m } \ln \left( \frac { T _ { o u t } } { T _ { i n } } \right) \Bigg ] } { \dot { m } c _ { a \nu } \left( T _ { o u t } - T _ { i n } \right) }
$$

# Results and discussion

The experiment was conducted for different flow rates with water and Sic water nano fluid separately for different days but at nearly constant atmospheric conditions with the average DNI (around $8 1 0 ~ \mathrm { W / m } ^ { 2 }$ ）andwalltemperatures to study the energy and exergy efficiencies of the concentratedsolar energy collector (dish reflector and receiver) system.

The flow diagram shows the thermal energy (energy) andexergy efficienciesat $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ while the water and the nano fluid were used separately as heat transfer fluids in the receiver while the energy and exergy received by the dish concentrator(dish reflector） are $9 . 6 2 4 1 8 \ \mathrm { k W }$ and $5 . 0 4 6 5 3 \ \mathrm { k W }$ with the loss of $3 . 1 1 3 4 2 \ \mathrm { k W }$ and 1.63256 kW,respectively. The energy andexergy of the solar receiver were $6 . 5 1 0 7 6 \mathrm { k W }$ and $3 . 4 1 3 9 7 \mathrm { k W } _ { ; }$ ,respectively, whereas the energy and exergy carried by the heat transfer fluid water were $1 . 9 2 8 4 2 \ \mathrm { k W }$ and $1 . 2 5 2 9 7 \ \mathrm { k W } ,$ respectively. While considering the nano fluid, the energy and exergy were $2 . 1 6 6 2 2 ~ \mathrm { k W }$ and $2 . 0 1 2 2 4 ~ \mathrm { k W } _ { ; }$ ，respectively, it shows that the energy and the exergy carried by the nano fluid are $0 . 2 3 7 8 \mathrm { k W }$ and $0 . 7 5 9 3 \mathrm { k W }$ higher than that of water. The respective difference in the loss of energyand exergy in the receiver for water and the nano fluid are $0 . 2 3 7 8 \mathrm { k W }$ and $0 . 7 5 9 3 \mathrm { k W } .$ ，which is equal to its higher gained value,it shows that the losses have been minimized while the nano fluid is in use;and also from the flow diagram it is found clearly that the energy and the exergy for the water and nano fluid were well balanced with the gain and the losses of the solar collector (reflector and receiver) system.

Fig.5Flow diagram of energy & exergy for the dish collector experiment during afternoon condition

Fig.6 shows the average values of DNI for every 15 minutes and corresponding wall temperatures to study the energy and exergy performances of the receiver for two hours during the afternoon time,in between $1 2 . 3 0 \mathrm { h }$ to $1 4 . 3 0 \mathrm { h }$

The overall heat loss factor for the low temperature small scale range (below $7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ ）concentrated solar power receiver has been plotted (Fig.7)with respect to the local time. The experimental results show high convective $( 4 . 3 0 \mathrm { k W } )$ and very low $( 0 . 0 8 5 \mathrm { k W } )$ radiative losses and also with the overall loss coefficient or heat loss factor (ULF) of 0.646 to 0.242 during $1 2 { : } 4 5 \mathrm { h }$ and at $1 4 { : } 3 0 \mathrm { h }$ respectively.

Fig.8 shows the maximum energy efficiency value of $3 2 . 9 1 \%$ for nano fluid and $2 9 . 9 4 \%$ for water based on wall temperatures at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ ； this higher valueof energy efficiency for the nano fluid is due to enhanced thermal conductivity $( K _ { e f f } = 0 . 8 0 0 1 1 5 4 ~ \mathrm { W / m K ) }$ （20 and convective heat transfer coefficient $( h _ { \mathrm { e x p } } = 0 . 6 8 8$ （204号 $\mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { K } )$ of nano fluid as compared to water ( $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { K _ { \rho } } = \mathbf { \rho }$ $0 . 6 8 0 8 \mathrm { W / m K } )$ _， $h _ { \mathrm { e x p } } = 0 . 3 3 1 \ \mathrm { W / m ^ { 2 } K } )$ . While considering the energy efficiency of nano fluid,the variations 号 $( 3 2 . 9 1 \% - 3 2 . 7 7 \% )$ are uniform after the peak value as compared to water $( 2 9 . 1 4 \% - 2 6 . 1 7 \% )$ ，which drops suddenly. This is due to the energy losses from the receiver to the atmosphere while nano fluid $( 4 . 3 4 4 5 4 ~ \mathrm { k W } )$ and

water $( 4 . 5 8 2 3 4 \mathrm { k W } )$ in use,it is also based on the energy conversion efficiencies of the fluids (water $1 . 9 2 8 4 2 \ \mathrm { k W }$ and nano fluid $2 . 1 6 6 2 2 \mathrm { k W }$ ,itisclearly indicated in the flow diagram.

The exergy efficiencies at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ withmaximum of $3 9 . 8 3 \%$ and $2 4 . 8 2 \%$ for nano fluid and water respectively,itis because of the average quantities of exergy losses of nano fluid $( 1 . 4 0 1 7 3 ~ \mathrm { k W } )$ is less than that of water $( 2 . 1 6 1 \mathrm { k W } )$ . Thevalue of exergy efficiencies dropuniformly for the nano fluid,whereas suddenly for water,because of the increased thermal conductivity and Nusselt number of SiC/water,which helps the receiver sustainuniform temperature difference between the wall and the HTF,which in turn enhance the exergy efficiency of nano fluid by $3 7 . 6 8 \%$ than Water at the flow rate of $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { l p m }$ .At the local time of $1 3 { : } 3 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ where the intensity of solar irradiation and the absorber temperature are the maximum (Fig.6),the exergy efficiencies of both fluids are also found maximum, it shows that the exergy efficiency is based on the higher inlet temperature and temperature difference of receiver [9] with the atmosphere.

Fig.8Variation of energy and exergy efficiencies of water and nano fluid at $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ with local time

Fig.9 shows at the flow rate of $0 . 6 1 \mathrm { p m }$ the energy efficiency of water varies uniformly and drops from the maximum efficiency of $2 9 . 7 6 \%$ at $1 3 { : } 1 5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，but the nano fluid energy efficiency varies non-uniformly with up and down and reaches the maximum efficiency of $3 1 . 3 9 \%$ at $1 3 { : } 3 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .The exergy efficiency drops for both HTFs,but it is clear from the plot that the value of exergy efficiencies varies non-uniformly for nano fluid than water and is also lower compare to the value of $0 . 5 \mathrm { \ l p m }$ flow rates for the nano fluid. The maximum exergy efficiency at 0.6 lpm is $2 1 . 2 3 \%$ $( 1 3 . 1 5 \mathrm { h } )$ and $3 3 . 7 9 \%$ $( 1 3 ; 4 5 \mathrm { h } )$ for water and nano fluid, respectively. The energy and exergy efficiencies for the nano fluid at the flow rate of $0 . 6 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ is fluctuating and dropping lower than at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ ,which may be caused by the increase of laminar sublayer by the enhanced values of density $( 9 8 5 . 9 6 \mathrm { k g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ at $1 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { C } )$ and viscosity $( 0 . 0 0 0 6 0 2 2 \mathrm { k g / m s } )$ of the nano fluid with $1 \%$ volume fraction. Even though the improved properties of nano fluid like thermal conductivity and density reduce the laminar sub-layer by thermal diffusion,the enhanced viscosity may increase the laminar sub-layer of the boundary,which will widen the temperature difference (decrease in thermal conductivity） between the wall and the fluid.The same trend has been discussed by Wenhua Yu et al[12]in the heat transfer experiments conducted on water based SiC nano fluid. This problem may be overcome by optimizing the particle size,volume concentration for higher velocities to reduce the viscosity,which may decrease (increase the thermal conductivity） the laminar sub-layer.

Fig.1O shows throughout the experiment period for flow rates of $0 . 2 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ to $0 . 6 \mathrm { \ : l p m }$ the thermal efficiency (energy)of SiC/Water nano fluid is higher than that of water, with exception only at the flow rate of $0 . 2 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ The values of exergy efficiency of nano fluid are higher than that of water for the flow rates from 0.2 to $0 . 6 1 \mathrm { p m }$ $\mathrm { A t } 0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ the maximum value of exergy efficiencies for nano fluid and water are $3 9 . 8 3 \%$ and $2 4 . 8 2 \%$ ，respectively，which shows the enhanced energy(exergy）conversion ability(enhanced heat transfer properties) of the nano fluid is higher than that of the base fluid water.

Fig.11 Comparison of exergy factors of water and nano fluid for the flow rates from 0.2 to $0 . 6 \mathrm { l p m }$

The ratio of energy rate to exergy rate (exergy factor) for the receiver is shown in Fig.11,with the maximum valuesof 0.3932 $( 0 . 3 \ \mathrm { l p m } )$ and 0.3286 $( 0 . 2 \ \mathrm { l p m } )$ forthe nano fluid and the base fluid water, respectively. The reason for the exergy factor difference between the two HTFs are clearly indicated in the flow diagram (Fig. 5), which shows that the average exergy loss and exergy rates of the nano fluid are $3 5 . 1 6 \%$ lower and $2 3 . 8 8 \%$ higher than that of water.Also from Fig.12, the exergy factors for the nano fluid for different flow rates are higher than that of water. It is advisable that optimizing the particle size (to enhance specific heat capacity） and volume fraction (to enhance density) enhances the energy and exergy efficiencies at $0 . 6 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ ，which in turn will improve the exergy factor.

Fig.12Variation of average Nusselt number with respect to flow rates for water and nano fluid

Fig.12 shows the variations of average Nusselt number with respect to flow rates.At the flow rate of $0 . 2 \mathrm { l p m }$ the average Nusselt number for water is higher than that of nano fluid,thereafter $0 . 2 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ ，the average Nusselt number values for nano fluid is higher than water for all otherflow rates.The average Nusselt number is higher at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ for the nano fluid than that of Water,also after the flow rate of $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ the Nusselt number value starts to decrease.It is clear from Fig.12 that the maximum average Nusselt number values are 6.299 and 5.431 for nano fluid and water,respectively.It indicates that the convective heat transfer coefficient gradually increases up to $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { l p m }$ and thereafter it starts to decrease.This may lead to decrease in energy and exergy efficiencies of nano fluid beyond $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$

# Conclusions

In this study, concentrated solar dish reflector and cavity receiver collector system is fabricated and experimented to find the energy efficiency,exergy efficiency, and exergy factor for the same solar intensity with water and SiC +water. The following conclusions can be drawn:

The energy and exergy efficiencies of the solar receiverwithwaterasheattransferfluidvarywithflowrate for the same solar intensity. The energy efficiency increases from 12.74 to $2 9 . 1 4 \%$ when the water flow rate increases from 0.2 to $0 . 6 1 \mathrm { p m }$ .For the same solar intensity, the ex ergy efficiency varies from 16.61 to $2 4 . 8 2 \%$ when water flow rate increases from 0.2 to $0 . 5 \mathrm { \ : l p m }$ .The exergy efficiency $( 2 1 . 2 3 \% )$ starts to decrease at water flow rate of $0 . 6 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ . Compared with energy efficiencies,the exergy efficiencies are lower for water except at $0 . 2 \mathrm { l p m }$

The energy efficiency increases from 12.52 to $3 2 . 9 1 \%$ when the nano fluid flow rate increases from O.2 to O.5 lpm.For the same solar intensity,the exergy efficiency varies from 18.33 to $3 9 . 8 3 \%$ for increasing nano fluid flow rate from 0.2 to $0 . 5 \ \mathrm { l p m }$ . The energy and exergy efficiencies $( 3 1 . 3 9 \%$ & $3 3 . 7 9 \%$ ）startto decrease at 0.6 lpm nano fluid flow rate. Compared with energy efficiency, the exergy efficiency is high for all the flow rates of nano fluid.

The maximum energy efficiencies of $2 9 . 1 4 \%$ and $3 2 . 9 1 \%$ were obtained at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ for water and nano fluid,respectively. The maximum exergy efficiencies of $2 4 . 8 2 \%$ and $3 9 . 8 3 \%$ were obtained at the flow rate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$ for water and nano fluid, respectively. The enhanced energy and exergy efficiencies of $12 . 9 4 \%$ and $6 0 . 4 8 \%$ have beenachieved by $\mathrm { S i C + }$ waternano fluid asheattransferfluidthanthatofwaterattheflowrate of $0 . 5 \mathrm { l p m }$

The ratio of energy rate to exergy rate (exergy factor) of the receiver is better (maximum O.3932 & average 0.363) for the nano fluid than water (maximum O.3286 & average O.248O) forall the flow rates.
