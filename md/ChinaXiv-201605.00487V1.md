# Summary

Soya bean (Glycine max) and grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) seeds are important sources of dietary proteins; however,they also contain antinutritional metabolite oxalic acid (OA).Excess dietary intake of OA leads to nephrolithiasis due to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in kidneys. Besides, OA is also a known precursor of $\beta$ -N-oxalyl- $\mathsf { L } \mathsf { - } \mathsf { \alpha } _ { \mathsf { X } } , \mathsf { \beta } _ { \mathsf { - } }$ -diaminopropionic acid ( $\beta \cdot$ -ODAP),a neurotoxin found in grass pea. Here,we report the reduction in OA level in soya bean (up to $73 \%$ ）and grass pea (up to $7 5 \%$ ）seeds by constitutive and/or seed-specific expression of an oxalate-degrading enzyme,oxalate decarboxylase (FvOXDC)of Flammulina velutipes.Inaddition, $\beta$ -ODAP level of grass pea seeds was also reduced up to $73 \%$ .Reduced OA content was interrelated with the associated increase in seeds micronutrients such as calcium,iron and zinc. Moreover,constitutive expresson of FvOXDC led to improved tolerance to the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum that requires OA during host colonization.Importantly，FvOXDCexpressing soya bean and grass pea plants were similar to the wild type with respect to the morphology and photosynthetic rates,and seed protein pool remained unaltered as revealed by the comparative proteomic analysis.Taken together,these results demonstrated improved seed quality and tolerance to the fungal pathogen in two important legume crops,by the expression of an oxalate-degrading enzyme.

# Introduction

Oxalic acid (OA),a strong dicarboxylic acid, is naturally abundant infruits，vegetables and seeds (Holmes and Kennedy，2000; Holmes et al.,1998).At physiological pH,OA forms soluble salts withsodium and potassium;however，OA chelates calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate，which renders OA clinically important. Because humans cannot degrade ingested OA due to the lack of any biological and/or enzymatic system，the consumption of high OA-containing vegetable diet is considered detrimental to the human health.This leads to hyperoxaluria and destruction of renal tissues because of the precipitation of calcium oxalate in the kidneys,a medical condition known as nephrolithiasis (Robertson and Peacock，198O； Sidhu et al., 1999).

Legumes constitute the main source of proteins to the majority of human diets.Legume proteins are rich in essential amino acid lysine，which is lacked in cereals.Besides,legumes are the source of a wide array of essential nutrients,low glycaemic carbohydrates，dietary fibre，vitaminsand minerals, and cultivation of legume improves soil health of the agricultural and agroforestry systems.Soya bean (Glycine max) and grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) are legumes with abundant economical and nutritional importance.Soya bean seeds contain around $3 8 \% - 4 0 \%$ proteins,whereas beans and/or peas contain nearly

$20 \%$ proteins (Gwtek et al.，2014).Moreover，soya bean is responsible for providing more than half of globally consumed edible oil (SoyStats,2013,available at www.soystats.com).Soya bean has become indispensible because it provides a wide range ofpotential advantages such as protein-based biodegradable materials，anticancerous constituents and potential to lower cholesterol (Ko et al.，2013).Such varied uses of soya bean made ita more desired crop,and its global demand is increasing day by day (Deshmukh et al.,2014).Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) is also an agronomically important crop due to its high protein content，good grain yield,resistance to insects as well as pests. Moreover,it has a potential to tolerate extensive drought and water-logging stresses (Yan et al.，20o6; Zambre et al.，2002). This crop is cultivated and consumed in various parts of the World not only for animal feed and fodder but also for human consumption，because it is an inexpensive source of dietary lysine-rich protein for people of low-income food-deficit countries (Barik et al.，2005;Smartt,1990).However，OA found in soya bean and grass pea seeds is an antinutritional factor (Chai et al.，2004;Yan et al.，2006).Oxalate content of soya bean varies from 0.67 to $3 . 5 \ \mathsf { g } / 1 0 0 \ \mathsf { g }$ of seeds dry weight (Massey etal.，2oo1).Moreover,OA also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of a grass pea neurotoxin, $\beta$ -N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid $\mathrm { . \Delta \beta }$ -ODAP) (Xiong et al.，2015).Some of the grass pea germplasms also display a significant variabilityin $\beta$ -ODAP content，and these grass peas contain $0 . 5 \% - 2 . 5 \%$ $\beta$ -ODAPintheseeds(Xiongetal.， 2015)． Prolonged consumption ofL.sativus causes neurolathyrism，whichis characterized by spasticity of leg muscles,lower limb paralysis, convulsions and death (Yan et al.，2006).

Besides，OA is considered as a pathogenesis factor for the devastating phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia scleriotorum which synthesizes and secretes OA during host colonization (Kabbage et al.，2015; Malencic et al.，2010;Uloth et al., 2015).Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, instigates white mould of more than 40o plant species, including important crops such as cotton，tomato，sunflower, grass pea and soya bean (Heller and Witt-Geiges,2013).The pathogenicity of S.sclerotiorum is concomitant with OA secretion by fungus，and OA is thought to play a crucial role in infection.The relationship between Sclerotinia pathogenicity and OA secretion might heighten Sclerotinia virulence mostly by three modes of action (Dutton and Evans,1996).First,fungus secretes several cell wall-degrading enzymes such as polygalacturonase to invade plant tissues. These enzymes work at low pH,and OA might play an important role in providing the low pH environment for these enzymes.Second，the presence of OA brings down pH of the infection site due to its acidic nature，which further leads to weakening of the plant and thereby facilitates the invasion to plant tissue.Thirdly,because ${ \mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ is an essential_component of plant defence system，OA could bind with ${ \mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ and form calcium oxalate which may compromise the function of ${ \mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ -dependent defence.Chelation of cell wall ${ \mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ by OA might not only compromise the function of ${ \mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ -dependent defence responses but also weaken the plant cell wall (Bateman and Beer，1965; Cessna et al., 2000;Dutton and Evans,1996).This further provides a platform for fungal degradative enzymes to assist the fungal infection (Lumsden,1979).Moreover，the accumulation of high level of OA during fungal infection results in wilting of the plants and finally cell death (Kim et al.，2008).

Oxalic acid can be biodegraded via two pathways，that is oxidation and decarboxylation. Oxalate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.4), belongs to the germin family of proteins，expressed predominantly in higher plants,catalyses the oxygen-dependent oxidation of oxalate to carbon dioxide in a reaction that is coupled withthe formation of hydrogen peroxide.Oxalate oxidase activityis found ina widevariety of plants,including barley seedling，rootsand leaves,Amaranthus leaves,beet stemsand leaves,sorghum leaves and maize,oats,rice and rye (Hurkman etal.，1991;Lathikaetal.，1995).Flammulinavelutipesoxalate decarboxylase (FvOXDC)is thought to be the best characterized oxalate decarboxylase from the wood-rotting fungus reported till date (Chakraborty et al.，2002).FvOXDC is specific to oxalate,and it catabolizes to formic acid (nontoxic organic acid) and ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ inasingle step without the requirement of a cofactor. This enzyme is active at low pH which would be helpful as most of the oxalate is localized in plant cell vacuoles,where pH is low.FvOXDC is a hexamer of six identical subunits of $4 1 0 ~ \mathsf { k D a }$ molecular mass，and the hexamer is a dimer of trimers (Chakraborty et al.，2002)．The $\mathsf { M n } ^ { 2 + }$ and OA binding to the active site of FvOXDC plays a key role in enzyme catalysis (Chakraborty etal.,2002).

In this present study,we have developed transgenic soya bean and grass pea lines by constitutive and/or seed-specific expression of FvOXDC with the aim to reduce OA in soya bean and both OA and $\beta$ -ODAP in grass pea.The reduction of OA in soya bean and grass pea not only improved their seed nutritional quality but also conferred tolerance to S.sclerotiorum.

# Results

# Expression and stable integration of FvOXDC in transgenic soya bean and grass pea

To reduce the levels of antinutritional OA in soya bean and OA and $\beta$ -ODAP in grass pea,we have generated transgenic lines for both soya bean and grass pea for CaMV35S-driven constitutive expression of FvOXDC.Moreover，seed-specific expression of FvOXDC was also achieved in soya bean using the seed-specific promoter of soya bean late-embryogenesis-abundant protein (LEA protein; GmPM9).The pSOVA expression plasmid contained FvOXDC under the control of the CaMV35S promoter (Figure 1a). In pSPM9 plasmid,FvOxDCwas under the control of seed-specific promoter (Figure 1h).These two $F V O X D C$ constructs (pSOVA and pSPM9) were used to transform soya bean cultivar MACS-57 via Agrobacteriumtumefaciens-mediatedtransformation by followingarobust and reproducible transformation protocol involving soya bean cotyledonary nods as explants (Figure S1).However, for grass pea，embryos were used as explants (Figure S2） to transform cultivar LP-24.FvOXDC gene amplification,following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using FvOXDC-specific primers and genomic DNA as template,was carried out for the kanamycin resistance and single-copy transgene-integrated T3 (soya bean SOVA lines and PSPM9 lines) and T4 (grass pea SOVA lines) generation transgenic lines (Figure 1b,c,i).PCR-amplified DNA fragment of 75o bp was detected in all the kanamycin-resistant transgenic lines,confirming genomic integration of the FvOXDC.

# FvOXDC protein expression and oxalate decarboxylase activity in transgenic plants

To confirm the expression of FvOXDC in soya bean and grass pea, immunoblot assay was performed using polyclonal anti-FvOXDC antibody.Immunoblot assay using total soluble protein revealed an immunoreactive band of $5 5 ~ \mathsf { k D a }$ ，corresponding to the predicted size of the FvOXDC (Figure 1d,e,j).However，protein band corresponding to the FvOXDC was not detected in the protein extracts of nontransformed (wild-type) plants,confirming specificity of the immunoreactive band.This result confirmed the expression of $F V O \times \mathsf { D C }$ protein in soya bean and grass pea transgenic lines. Further,to determine the functional expression of $F V O X D C$ in soya bean and grass pea, total protein extracts were examined for the $0 \times 0 C$ activity. The $0 \times 0 C$ activity was examined by measuring the liberation of $^ { 1 4 } { \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ from $^ { 1 4 } { \mathsf { C } }$ oxalic acid (Amersham，Little Chalfont，UK).FvOXDC was found tobe functionally active with five to sevenfold increasein ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ production in transgenic soya bean in pSOVA and pSPM9 FvOXDC-expressing lines，respectively (Figure 1f,g) and two to threefold increase in ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ production in transgenic grass pea pSOVA lines (Figure 1k).Moreover, leaves of transgenic and wild type were tested for the OA sensitivity (Foster et al.，2012; Kesarwani etal.,2ooo). Leaves of FvOXDC-expressing transgenic plants were less chlorotic compared to wild type (Figure 1l).These resultsconfirmed in plantarole of FvOXDCin OA degradation.

# Expression of FvOXDC decreases OA level in soya bean and OA and $\mathfrak { \textbf { \beta } }$ -ODAP level in grass pea

FvOXDC-expressing transgenic soya bean and grass pea lines wereassayed for seed OA and $\beta$ -ODAP content and compared with the nontransformed wild-type plants.The analysis revealed up to $67 \%$ reduction in OA level in pSOVA lines (Figure 2a)and up to $73 \%$ reduction in pSPM9 lines of soya bean (Figure 3a), whereas OA and $\beta$ -ODAP contents of grass pea were reduced up to $7 5 \%$ and $7 3 \%$ ，respectively (Figure 4a,b). As FvOXDCmediated decarboxylation of OA results in the generation of formic acid,the levels of formic acid in the seeds of FvOXDC

expressing transgenic lines were also determined.A concomitant increase $( 7 0 \% )$ in formic acid was observed with the expression of FvOXDC in soya bean transgenic lines (Figures 2b and 3b). Thus, $F V O X D C$ expression was correlated with the reduced level of OA in soya bean and grass pea and reduced $\beta$ -ODAP level in grass pea.

# Reduction in OA content resulted in increased levels of some micronutrients

Micronutrients play a crucial role in human and animal health, and thus,it is desired to generate transgenic plants with higher levels of these components (Gupta et al.,2015;Hefferon,2015). Because OA isa strong chelator of divalent cations,especially calcium， therefore，we were interested to determinethe micronutrient contents in FvOXDC-expressing transgenic soya beanand grass pea seeds.Calcium and other micronutrients such asmagnesium,zinc,iron,sodium and potassium were analysed byenergy-dispersive $\mathsf { X }$ -rayfluorescence analysis (EDXRF)．A marked increase in the levels of calcium，magnesium,zinc,iron and manganese in the seeds was recorded.Calcium level increased more than two folds in low-oxalate transgenic pSOVA and pSPM9 lines of soya bean (Figures 2c and 3c).In the seeds of both pSOVA and pSPM9 line,a significant increase in the levels of other nutrients such as Mg,Fe,Zn and Mn was also noticed in comparison with the control seeds (Figures 2d-g and 3d-g).The content of calcium，magnesium，zinc，iron and manganese in grass pea seeds was also significantly increased (Figure 4c-g). These data suggested an increased concentration of micronutrients in the seeds of low-oxalate transgenic soya bean and grass pea.

# Reduced OA content led to enhanced tolerance to S.sclerotiorum

Sclerotinia sclerotiorum pathogenicity is associated with OA (Dutton and Evans,1996).Therefore,we tested the response of transgenic soya bean and grass pea，constitutively expressing FvOXDC,to the S.sclerotiorum infection.Transgenic soya bean and grass pea and wild-type plants were infected with S.sc/erotiorum as described in Experimental procedures using mycelia suspension，and the progression of disease symptoms was monitored for different time intervals.Inoculated leavesof transgenic and wild types were considered as infected with

S.sclerotiorum when the symptoms of tissue browning and lesion formation appeared. Compared to the nontransgenic wild type,FvOXDC-expressing transgenic leaves displayed a substantial delay in the lesion progression (Figure 5a,b).Lesion intensity was also low in transgenic pSOVA lines of both soya bean and grass peaas compared to their corresponding wild-type plants (Figure 5c,d).

# Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed unaltered protein profile in the seeds of transgenic plants

Seeds of transgenic soya bean and grass pea were examined for their protein profile using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis and compared to the wild type as described in Experimental procedures.To understand protein profile of the transgenic and wild-type seeds,4 plex iTRAQ labels were used. Proteins of the wild type were labelled with 114 and 115,whereas proteins of the transgenic soya bean were labelled with 116 and 117.In case of grass pea,proteins isolated from wild type were labelled with 114 and 115，whereas proteins isolated from transgenic grass pea were labelled with 116 and 117.iTRAQ analysis revealed unaltered protein profiles in the seeds of transgenic and wild-type soya bean and grass pea (Figure S3a,b and Tables S1 and S2).

# Transgenic soya bean and grass pea resembled wild-type plants with respect to growth and developmental phenotype and physiology

Transgenic soya bean and grass pea were compared with wildtype plants,either in the primary transgenic populations or in the subsequent generations,and there were no observable differences in phenotype，development or fertility in any of five independent transgenic line of each soya bean (pSOVA,pSPM9) and grass pea (pSOVA) transgenic lines.Transgenic lines were also checked for their field performance by transplanting them in the experimental field alongside wild-type plants and randomly replicated for further generations.Transgenic plants were normal

invegetative growth，and their morphology was normal as compared to the wild-type plants.Transgenic plants were similar in flowering time,vigour or total yield as observed for wild type. Moreover，expression of FvOXDC did not affect the net photosynthetic rates or other physiological parameters，including stomatal conductance and transpiration rate.

# Discussion

With long exposure of plant breeding techniques and genetically modification through transgenic technology,there has been a substantial success in augmenting the nutritional value of food crops.Efforts have been made to improve the quality and quantity of macronutrients such as protein/amino acids,oils/fats and carbohydrates as well as to increase the bioavailabilityof micronutrients,vitamins and antioxidants through transgenics and breeding.In soya bean,most of the work was carried out to improve seed protein quality (Cunha et al.，2011；Nishizawa et al.,2010;Qi et al.,2011),oil content (Kajikawa et al.,2008; Li et al.，201O)，biotic resistance (Cunha et al.，2010;Dang and Wei,2007; McLean et al.,2007;Tougou et al.,2007) and abiotic resistance (DeRonde etal.,2004;Valente et al.,2009). However, on the other hand，there have been limited efforts in the management of antinutrients and/or toxins,which are the byproducts of plant metabolism and considered as health hazards to humans and animals.OA is one of the known antinutritional factors,which has negative health concerns,when we consume crops containing high amount of OA,such as tomato,spinach, soya bean and grass pea.

Legumes are very challenging to regenerate and transform because somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis is found to be difficult (lantcheva et al.，2013).Here,in the present study,we have developed an efficient transformation method for both soya bean and grass pea using cotyledonary explants and embryo explants,respectively (Figures 1,S1 and S2).Further,to improve the nutritional quality of soya bean and grass pea by downregulating OA,we have developed transgenic plants expressing awell-characterized FvOXDC (Azam et al.， 2001， 2002; Chakraborty et al.，2002，2013；Kesarwani et al.，2000).Our results showed that there was a significant decrease in OA content in both the lines of pSOVA and pSPM9 (Figures 2aand 3a).Transgenic soya bean plants expressing FvOXDC in a seedspecific manner were superior in OA management than the constitutive lines. OA and $\beta$ -ODAP contents of grass pea were alsoassayed biochemically,and their contents were found to be reduced (Figure 4a,b).Expression of FvOXDC in soya bean and grass pea not only led to a significant reduction in OA levels but also associated with a substantial increase in calcium,conceivably by down-regulating the content of OA that chelates calcium (Figures 2c,3c and 4c).We havealso found an increase in other elements such as iron，manganese，magnesium and zinc in transgenic lines of soya bean and grass pea (Figures 2d-g,3d-g and 4d-g).Previous reports suggested that the expression of $\mathsf { C a } ^ { 2 + } / \mathsf { H } ^ { + }$ exchangers can alter the sum of all the mineral nutrients (Cheng et al.，2005;Mei et al.，2007).However，in FvOXDCexpressing transgenic lines,the increase may be related to the high turnover of OA,which ultimately leads to an increase in these elements.

Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is one of the most devastating,broadbased，necrotrophic，soilborne plant pathogens，which causes stem rot or white mould,with a host range of more than 400 species of plants,comprising crops,ornamental plants, trees and several weeds (Malencic et al.,201O).Studies with OA-deficient mutants have shown that this molecule is a key suppressor of plant defences, thus allowing the fungus to evade recognition (Williams etal.,2011).Therefore,the ability of S.sclerotiorum to infect FvOXDC-expressing low OA-containing transgenic soya beanand grass pea was tested.Infection assay performed with detached leaf revealed a noteworthy delay in lesion development and more tolerance to S.sclerotiorum infection by the FvOXDCexpressing transgenic lines compared to the wild type (Figure 5). These results also demonstrated that the generation of fungaltolerant soya bean and grass pea lines is also achievable by expressing FvOXDC.Previously，various transgenic plants,which can metabolize and/or degrade OA in an enzymatic manner, have been generated and shown to have enhanced tolerance to S.sclerotiorum (Cunha et al.,2010;Donaldson et al.,2001;Hu et al.，2003；Kesarwani et al.，2000;Walz et al.，2008).OA treatment suggested that FvOXDC is active in vivo as transgenic leaves of both soya bean and grass pea could resist the formation of brown lesion and yellowing caused by OA (Figure 1l).

Previous reports suggested that OA suppresses host defence by manipulating redox status (Cessna et al.，2ooo;Lehner et al., 2008；Williams et al.，2011).At the initial stage of disease establishment,OA induces a reducing environment in the host cells that suppresses host defence-related oxidative burst and callose deposition.However,at the later stage,OA promotes the generation of ROS in host tissue leading to programmed cell death which directly benefits the necrotrophic pathogens (Williams et al.， 2011)． Onthecontrary， nonpathogenic OA-deficient mutant is unable to alter host redox status (Cessna et al.,2000;Williams et al.,2011).Moreover, the effect of OA on host defence response might be mediated through phytohormone signalling pathways such as jasmonic acid (JA),ethylene (ET),abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA). It was suggested that OA induces JA, ET and ABA signalling pathways; however,it suppresses SA pathway in Brassica napus (Liang et al.，2009). Similarly，overexpression of OA-responsive WRKY family transcription factors revealed that JA/ET pathway is mainly active to defend Arabidopsis against S.sclerotiorum infection and OA stress (Chen et al.，2013).These observations are in agreement with an important role of the host JA/ET signalling pathway in response to necrotrophic fungal pathogens (Liang et al.，2008; Van Kan,2006;Yang et al.,2007;Zhao et al.,2007).Although wehave tested S.sclerotiorum tolerance of the FvOXDCexpressing transgenic lines of soya bean and grass pea (Figure 5), these transgenic lines might also exhibit an altered tolerance to other necrotrophic fungal pathogens such as Alternaria alternaria,Botrytis cinerea.Interestingly，manipulating host OA level through exogenous treatments has been shown to affect the infectivity of A.alternaria and B. cinerea (Schoonbeek et al., 2007;Tian et al.,2006).

To investigate the performance of the FvOXDC-expressing soya bean and grass pea，we have analysed the agronomic attributes of transgenic plants and compared with the wild type.Visible morphological changes such as plant height,leaf pattern and morphology, flowering pattern and timing,pod and seed setting as well as number of pods per plant and number of seeds per pod could not be recognized between wild type and FvOXDC-expressing lines.Although the seeds of transgenic linesaccumulated higher level of minerals than the wild type,it did not affect the plant growth and development (Figures 2-4). Inaprevious study，fruit-specific expression of FvOXDC in transgenic tomato lines was found similar in growth and development with their wild-type counterpart irrespective to a significant increase in mineral contents of fruits (Chakraborty et al.，2013)．Other studies also supported that increase in calcium content in transgenic plants did not affect the plant growth in tomato,potato and lettuce (Chung et al.，2010;Kim et al.，2006;Morris et al.，2008;Park et al.，2004，2009) Moreover，transgenic indica rice developed by endospermspecificexpression of soya bean ferritin foundto contain higher iron and zinc levels and showed normal phenotype,morphology and fertility (Vasconcelos et al.，2oo3).Altogether, these results suggested that the accumulation of mineral in seeds of the transgenic lines might not have an adverse effect on plant growth and development.

It was also important to determine seed proteins qualitatively and quantitatively to exclude any unintentional changes that may occur in transgenic seeds as a result of this genetic modification. Proteomic technology is very worthwhile to investigate protein variation due to innumerable changes during the transgenic modification of a crop (Natarajan et al.，2013).We have also evaluated the protein profiles of soya bean and grass pea seeds, usingproteomics'iTRAQ approach，because seeds or seedderived products are most consumed for these crops.Most of the proteins identified were checked for their differential expression, andwe foundno remarkable expression difference in the identified proteins (Figure S3a,b and Tables S1 and S2).To determine howa transgene might affect global gene expression or metabolism of the host plant,evaluation of transgenic plants can be performed at the levels of transcriptome,proteomics and metabolome (Ricroch et al.，2011). Previously，transcriptome profiling of about 24 Ooo genes of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing nptll/uidA revealed no noticeable difference with the wild type (El Ouakfaoui and Miki，20o5). Similarly，many researchersperformed profiling oftranscripts，proteinsand metabolites of transgenic plants without any significant differences (Barros et al.,2010;Cheng et al.,2008;Coll et al.,2009; Kogel et al.,201O). In conclusion,we have developed genetically modified soya bean and grass pea with improved nutritional quality and enhanced tolerance to fungal pathogen without any adverse effect on plant growth and development and seed protein quality.

# Experimental procedures

# Construction of FvOXDC expression vectors

Overexpression of $F V O X D C$ in soya bean and grass pea was performed using pSOVA (for soya bean and grass pea)and pSPM9(for soya bean）constructs.To overexpress FvOXDC specifically in soya bean seeds,the coding sequence of FvOXDC was cloned under the regulation of the promoter of a soya bean gene encoding LEA protein GmPM9 by replacing the CaMV35S promoter of pSOVA (Kesarwani et al.，2000)with the GmPM9 promoter (Lee et al.,200O).pSPM9 was mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 using the helper strain HB101:: pRK2013 via the triparental mating technique (Van Haute et al., 1983).

# Transformation and selection of transgenic events of soya bean

Cotyledonary node explants were excised from 7- to 10-day-old seedlings germinated on germination medium [Gamborg's B-5 basal medium (G5893)with $3 \%$ sucrose and $1 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ benzyl amino purine (BAP)，pH adjusted to 5.6-5.8]. After agroinfection， cotyledonary node explants weretransferred to co-cultivation medium [Gamborg's B-5 basal medium (G5893) with $3 \%$ sucrose, $2 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ acetosyringone, $0 . 2 5 { \mathrm { ~ m g / L } }$ gibberellic acid (GA3), $1 \ m \mathsf { M }$ dithiothreitol (DTT)，1 mM sodium thiosulphate (STS)，pH adjusted to 5.6] and maintained for 5 days. Further，explants were transferred to shoot inductionand selection medium [Gamborg's B-5 basal medium (G5893), $3 \%$ sucrose] supplemented with $1 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m g } / \mathsf { L }$ BAP， $0 . 2 5 { \mathrm { ~ m g / L } }$ GA3, $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ cefotaxime and $7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ kanamycin. Three- to 7-cmlong shoot buds were transferred to rooting media consisting of $\%$ MS basal media with $3 \%$ sucrose, $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ IAA, $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ kanamycin and $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ cefotaxime, $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } ~ 5 . 8$ Plantlets with well-developed roots were taken out from the medium,and the roots were rinsed in water to remove agar and transferred to small pots containing sterilized agro peat and vermiculite $( 2 : 1 )$

# Transformation and selection of transgenic events of grass pea

Embryo explants were used to transform FvOXDC gene to grass pea.Explants were excised from overnight-soaked seeds and then agro-infected and transferred to co-cultivation medium (Gamborg's B-5 basal medium, $3 \%$ sucrose, $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ NAA, $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ BAP， $1 \ m \mathsf { M }$ DTT，1 mM sodium thiosulphate and $0 . 2 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ acetosyringone, $\mathsf { p H } ~ 5 . 6 )$ and incubated at $2 3 ^ { \circ } C$ for 5 days.

Further，explants were transferred to shoot induction medium (Gamborg's B-5 basal medium, $3 \%$ sucrose with $0 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m g / L }$ NAA and $1 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ BAP，pH 5.6-5.8) and selected on $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m g / L } }$ kanamycin.Subculturing was performed at an interval of 15 days on shoot induction medium till shoots appeared.Small plantlets were excised and transferred to root induction medium (Gamborg's B-5 basal medium with $3 \%$ sucrose, $0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m g / L }$ IBA, ${ \mathsf { p H } } 5 . 6 )$ forrooting.Transformed plants were maintained in the growth room before being transferred to the experimental plot.

# Nucleic acid isolation and analysis

To confirm the integration of FvOXDC in the putative transgenic plant genome，genomic DNA was extracted from leaf tissue L $\cdot 1 0 0 \ \mathrm { m g } )$ using the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen,Duesseldorf, Germany).The stable integration of the FvOXDC gene in the transgenic soya bean and grass pea plants was determined via PCR using the forward and reverse primers ( $5 ^ { \prime }$ -GCGAAGTGGCCATTCAGCTTCAGC-3'）and 0 $5 ^ { \prime }$ -CAGCTCTCTCAAAGCACCAGGCTC-3), respectively.

# Immunodetection ofFvOXDC

Crude proteins were extracted from soya bean and grass pea transgenic plants and their respective controls.From each sample, $1 0 0 ~ \mu \ g$ of total protein was then separated on a $12 . 5 \%$ SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Proteins from SDS-PAGE gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose Hybond membrane by electrotransfer (GE Biosciences,Little Chalfont,UK).The membrane was probed with affinity-purified oxalate decarboxylase polyclonal antibody in combination with alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG,using NBT-BCIP reaction.

# Decarboxylation assay

The decarboxylation activity of $F V O X D C$ was determined using $^ { 1 4 } { \mathsf { C } }$ oxalic acid (GE Biosciences) as a substrate using a method described previously (Mehta and Datta,1991). $1 0 0 ~ \mu \ g$ of soluble protein from each biological replicate was used for the decarboxylation assay.Samples were analysed in triplicate，and the mean value was calculated.One unit of decarboxylase activity is equivalent to $1 \ \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { m } \ ^ { 1 4 } \mathrm { C - C O } _ { 2 }$ produced at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ The activity data were expressed as the means $\pm \mathsf { S D }$ of at least three independent experiments.

# OAtreatment to leaves

The assay was performed according to Kesarwani et al. (2000) withslight modifications. Young leaves (three each)were detached from transgenic (soya bean/grass pea)and control (soya bean/grass pea) plants.Both transgenic and control leaves were then immediately dipped in $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m M }$ OA solution $\mathsf { p H } ~ 4 . 0$ = Negative control was imposed by dipping the leaves in water. All the leaves were incubated in a plant growth chamber at $2 2 - 2 4 ^ { \circ } C$ under 16-h/8-h photoperiod for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ：

# Extraction and determination of OA and formicacid

Oxalic acid and formic acid were quantified using OA and formic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (BoehringerMannheim/R-Biopharm，Darmstadt, Germany). Briefly,each sample was crushed into fine powder using mortar and pestle and then further suspended in $5 0 0 ~ \mu \ L$ of MQ water. Homogenization was performed usinga PRO 2oo homogenizer for five cycles of 30 s each. Homogenate was then centrifuged at $1 3 \ 0 0 0 \ g$ for 15 min at room temperature,and the supernatant was collected.Oxalate and formate contents were measured using $1 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of the supernatant in triplicate,and the absorbance was read at 590 and $3 4 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ ，respectively.

# Determination of $\mathfrak { \textbf { \beta } }$ -ODAP

Estimation of $\beta$ -ODAP content from the transgenic and control plants was performed according to Rao (1978).To $1 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of seed extract, $2 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of $3 \textsf { N } \mathsf { K O H }$ was added and the tubes were placed on boiling water bath for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .Afteralkali hydrolysis, $7 0 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of water was added to the tubes so that the final volume of the reaction is $1 \ m L$ followed by the addition of $2 m L$ $o$ -phthalaldehyde(OPT) reagent. Samples were mixed and allowed to stand for $1 5 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ to develop yellow colour.The absorbance was measured at $4 2 0 ~ \mathsf { n m }$ ：

# Determination of calcium and other micronutrients

Total calcium and other micronutrients such as magnesium,zinc, iron and manganese were analysed by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescenceanalysis (EDXRF;PANalytical Epsilon 5,Almelo,The Netherlands). EDXRF gives unique spectra for each sample analysed.Seeds were grounded into fine powder and dried; then, $6 0 ~ \mathsf { m g }$ of dried seed powder was used to analyse the total calcium,magnesium,zinc, iron and manganese.A specific X-ray fluorescence signal emitted by the atoms after the photoelectric ionization was measured，and the radiation intensity of each element signal,which is proportional to the concentration of the element in the sample,isrecalculated internally froma stored set of calibration curves and can be shown directly in concentration units.

# Morphological characterization and photosynthetic activity

Plants were grown in the field,and the experiment was arranged inarandomized block design with three replicates.Plants were regularly watched for their morphological characters such as plant height, size of leaves,number of pods per plant and number of seeds per pod.Photosynthetic rates were measured with a GFS30oo portable photosynthesis measurement system (Walz, Effeltrich,Germany) after 6O days since they were planted.The experiment was performed at standard atmospheric (360 ppm $C 0 _ { 2 } )$ ，light conditions $( 7 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \Sigma )$ ，and humidity was maintained at $70 \%$ .Photosynthetic rate of the leaf was measured on the basis of single-leaf measurement experiment which was conducted on three different leaves in each plant.

# Detached leaf assays

To analyse the S. sc/erotiorum infection in transgenic with respect to wild type，detached leaf assay was performed according to Cunha et al.(2010)with minor modifications.S.sclerotiorum were grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB)at $2 2 ^ { \circ } C$ with 150 rpm till the growth of mycelial ball.Then, $2 { \mathfrak { g } }$ of mycelial ball was homogenized into4 mLof /PDB and $1 0 ~ \mu \iota$ of mycelial suspension was inoculated on detached leaves of transgenic soya bean and grass pea as well as to their wild-type counterparts.Leaves were photographed at three different times (24,72 and $1 1 0 { \mathrm { ~ h } } )$ ，and images were used to measure the infected area using the NIS Element AR3.2 64-bit software of multiobjective stereo zoom (AZ100) microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.,Melville,NY,USA).

# Protein isolation,trypsin digestion,iTRAQ 4-plex labellingand dataanalysis

Total proteins were isolated from soya bean and grass pea seeds usingPlant Total Protein Extraction Kit (Sigma-Aldrich,St Louis,

MO,USA,Catalog number PE023O) according to the manufacturer's instructions.For proteomic analysis，biological duplicates from each of the two conditions (wild type and transgenic line) studied were handled simultaneously for iTRAQ labelling (AB Sciex，Foster City，CA)as per the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, $7 0 ~ \mu \ g$ of protein from each sample was used for modified trypsin (Promega，Madison,WI,USA,V511）and incubated for $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $3 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ina $1 : 1 0$ trypsin-to-protein ratio (Maity et al., 2014).To label trypsin-digested peptides of each sample, different iTRAQ tags such as 114，115，116 and 117 were used following the manufacturer's protocol (AB Sciex).The data wereassimilated in an information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode Analyst TF 1.6 software (AB Sciex) using the triple ToF 5600 (AB Sciex)．For the identification of proteins，Paragon algorithmina'Thorough $| \mathsf { D } ^ { \prime } \rrangle$ search mode was employed against the SGD-Saccharomyces cerevisiae reference data set (6750protein sequences).The search parameters allowed modifications by IAA at cysteine residues,4 plex peptide iTRAQ labelling of the N-termini of peptides and of the side chainsof lysine.Weapplied $1 \%$ global protein-level FDR for protein identification.
