Extracellular polymeric substances

Degradation of metals due to corrosion causes serious economic problems throughout the world,and different corrosion protection techniques are being used to extend the service life of metallc structures.It has been suggested that some microorganisms can inhibit electrochemicalcorrosion of metals. Here we isolated a new marine inhibitory bacterium,Vibrio neocaledonicus sp.,and EIS results showed that thecorrosionresistanceof carbon stelincreased bymore than sixty fold inthe presenceofthis bacterium.This is thehighest corrosion inhibitory effect reported forbacteriaand is comparablewith some industrial coatings suchas electroless Ni.Thisbacterium affected corrosion by the formation ofan inhibitory layeron the metal surface in the first hours of attachment, with the consumption of oxygen by electron transport proteins.Extracellular polymeric substances produced by this bacterium also haveacorrosion inhibitoryefect.Thus we proposea new,natural,non-toxic,and costeffective system for controlling corrosion processes using this bacterium or extracellular polymeric substances produced by this bacterium.

# 1. Introduction

Marine steel structures,such as harbor and oil exploration facilities, become corroded over time and need to be renovated or modified, which is expensive.Currently,bio-based anti-corrosion agents are new substitutes for conventional products which are composed of biological products [1-3].

Due to the high interest for the application of natural, non-toxic and efective environmentally friendly materials as corrosion inhibitors instead of biocides or toxic evaporative organic compounds, the use of bacteria and their metabolic by-products including biofilmand extracellular polymeric substances(EPSs）is considereda lot.It has been suggested that bacteria and their metabolic by-products can eliminate corrosion-causing parameters,possibly due to the formation of biofilms that use up the oxygen which would otherwise be available to oxidize that metal [4-7].

The first report on the corrosion inhibitory effect of bacteria was by Pedersen et al.[8].Later, Jayaraman et al.[9] studied the mechanism underlying this process and reported that biofilm formation was crucial. A variety of bacteria have been isolated and their corrosion inhibitory effectswere examined[1O-13].The highest inhibitory effectof tenfold was found for Pseudomonasmendocina KR1[6].Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain corrosion inhibition by bacteria such as oxygen depletion on the metal surface because of biofilm formation [14]; formation of inorganic materials [15]; generation of antimicrobials by biofilms [16]; production of biofilm-secreted biosurfactant [17]; and corrosion inhibition by bacteriophages [18].

In this study,we presenta new marine inhibitory bacterium,Vibrio neocaledonicus sp.,with the highest corrosion inhibitory effect reported for bacteria.The mechanism and efficiency of corrosion inhibition were studied by different electrochemical,surface analysis and spectroscopic methods.To confirm the inhibitory effect of bacterium metabolic byproducts,EPS produced by this bacterium was extracted and examined.

# 2.Materials and methods

# 2.1.Isolation and identification

Marine V.neocaledonicus sp.KJ841877 was isolated from marine sludge that was collected from the East Sea.Sampling,strain isolation, and culture procedures have been described previously[19].This bacterium is deposited as MCCC1Koo266 in the Marine Culture Collection of

China (MCCC),Xiamen, China.A strain culture is stored at $- 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ in marine broth (MB) that contained $3 0 \%$ glycerol.

# 2.2.Materials

Squared-shaped carbon steel (ASTM A36）specimens with sides $1 5 \mathrm { m m }$ thickness of $1 \mathrm { m m }$ were used.A36 carbon steel (CS) is composed of 0.20 wt.% C,1.4 wt.% Mn, 0.35 wt.% Si, $0 . 0 4 5 \mathrm { w t } . \% S$ ,and $0 . 0 4 5 \mathrm { w t . \% P }$ with the remainder Fe.The method for creating working electrodes has been described elsewhere [2O].The surfaces were sterilized with UV light and pure ethanol for1h before experiments.

Artificial seawater [21] was used throughout the corrosion studies, and approximately $3 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ of peptone was added to this medium as a carbon and energy source.Then,the solution was autoclaved at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ Before performing electrochemical experiments,the metal samples were placed in artificial seawater under sterile conditions and in the presence of bacteria in an aerobic chamber.The samples were then incubated at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ on a rotary shaker at $8 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ .During electrochemical measurements,samples were immersed ina water bath to maintain the temperature at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

# 2.3.Electrochemical studies

Electrochemical tests were performed in a corrosion cell with a three-electrode system using an AUTOLAB Potentiostat/Galvanostat (PGSTAT3o2).Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS）was performed at a steady state open circuit potential $( E _ { O C P } )$ with an AC sine wave of amplitude $1 0 \mathrm { m V }$ at frequencies ranging from $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k H z }$ to $1 0 \mathrm { M H z }$ .Potentiodynamic polarization curves were then obtained at a scan rate of $0 . 1 6 6 ~ \mathrm { m V / s }$ .GPES wasused to acquire dataand analyze potentiodynamic polarization curve data;FRA with ZSIMPWIN software was used for EIS data analysis.Experiments were performed three times for each condition used,and standard deviations(SDs) were also calculated to determine the precision and repeatability of electrochemical results.

# 2.4.Surface observation and characterization

The surface characteristics and corrosion features of CS specimens were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) after the specimens were exposed to artificial seawater withoutand with bacteria for different times.Before experiments,bacterial cellswere fixed and dehydrated by the immersion of the samples in $2 \%$ glutaraldehyde solution for $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ anddehydration by four ethanol solutions ( $1 5 \mathrm { m i n }$ each): $2 5 \%$ = $5 0 \%$ $7 5 \%$ and $100 \%$ .Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR） and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)analyses were used for surface characterization.The test metal samples were exposed to sterile artificial seawater either without or with bacteria for 1O days.Then, the samples were dried and examined structurally using FTIR and XPS.To analyze the bacterium-produced EPS,pellets for infrared analysis were obtained by grinding a mixture of $2 \ : \mathrm { m g }$ of polysaccharide with $2 0 0 \mathrm { m g }$ of dry KBr,followed by pressing into a $1 6 \mathrm { - m m }$ diameter mold.FTIR spectra were recorded with a resolution of $4 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ in the $4 0 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ region. XPS measurements were estimated using an AXIS ULTRA DLD spectrometer(Shimadzu,Japan) with a monochromatized Al $\mathrm { K } _ { \alpha }$ X-ray source ( $\mathrm { \Delta I n v } = 1 4 8 6 . 6 \mathrm { e V } .$ andan X-ray beam of around $1 \mathrm { m m }$ .Survey spectra were recorded for samples in the $0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 1 0 0 { \mathrm { e V } }$ kinetic energy range using1 eV steps and high resolution scans were performed using $0 . 1 \mathrm { e V }$ steps over the following regions of interest: C1s,N1s,O1sand Fe 2p.Quantification of outer layer atomic compositions and spectral simulation of the experimental peaks were achieved using software provided by VG Scientific.Dried EPS was compressed into a pellet and attached to a carbon tape for XPS analysis.

# 2.5.EPS production

For EPS production, the bacteria were grown in artificial seawater that included $5 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ of peptone, $1 \ \mathrm { g / L }$ of yeast extract and $3 0 ~ \mathrm { g / L }$ of glucose.The pH of the medium wasadjusted to 7.5 with saturated NaOH.The mediumwas sterilized byautoclavingat $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and was inoculated with 2 vol. $\%$ 18-h-old culture grown in the same mediumat room temperature ona rotary shaker at $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ .Then, the culture was centrifuged at $1 5 , 0 0 0 \times g$ at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ for $2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .The supernatants were pressure filtered through cellulose nitrate filters (pore size $0 . 2 5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ).The supernatant liquid was then transferred to a new Oak Ridge tube.Adding isopropanol effectively lowered the solubility of polymers and caused them to precipitate.Centrifugation ( $7 0 0 0 \times g$ for $5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ )was used to separate the liquid supernatant from the precipitate, which was dried at $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to remove any residual isopropanol [22].

# 3.Results and discussion

# 3.1.V.neocaledonicus sp.and its corrosion inhibition efficiency

A new generation of Vibrio strain,V.neocaledonicus sp.KJ841877 was isolated from the East Sea (Ningbo, China, GP $\textsf { S } 2 9 ^ { \circ } 5 9 ^ { \prime } 5 0 . 5 9 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathsf { N }$ $1 2 2 ^ { \circ } 2 ^ { \prime }$ $3 4 . 9 9 ^ { \prime \prime } \mathrm { E }$ )and after submitted to GenBank,deposited as MCCC1K00266 in Marine Culture Collection of China(MCCC),Xiamen,China.This bacterium is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria that are typically found insaltwater.These bacteria have developed various strategies to survive under extreme conditions,such as metabolic pathwayadaptations including the production of protective structures like biofilms [23].

The corrosion inhibitory effect was investigated using electrochemical techniques.The results showed that the impedance of specimens exposed only to sterile artificial seawater was approximately $8 3 0 \Omega \cdot \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ and increased to 1311 $\scriptstyle \Omega \cdot \mathbf { c m } ^ { 2 }$ after one month.However,in the presence of the bacteria,the impedance value was nearly $4 0 , 7 0 0 \Omega \cdot \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ after $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ and increased to $4 9 , 0 0 0 \Omega \cdot \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ after one month.Thus,this type of bacterium increased impedance up to sixty fold after one month (Fig.1a),and thereafter, the impedanceremained relatively stable.This capacityis comparable with some industrial coatings such as electroless Ni-P or Ni-P-PTFE [24,25].

Potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed that the corrosion current density $( i _ { c o r r } )$ decreased significantly for samples exposed to the bacteria.As can be seen in Fig.1b,the cathodic curves shifted toward a lower current density in the presence of bacteria, confirming a decrease in $0 _ { 2 }$ reduction reaction,as bacteria generally use $0 _ { 2 }$ to oxidize nutrientsand obtain energy.Inaddition,the bacterium retarded the rate of the anodic process,probably through the mechanism of adsorption [26].The electrochemical values were obtained by the extrapolation of the linear Tafel segments.The results showed that the corrosion current density of CS decreased from $2 9 . 5 9 \mu \mathrm { A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ to $1 . 2 4 \mu \mathrm { A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ after $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ and reached to $0 . 9 4 \mu \mathrm { A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ after 10 days of exposure to the sterile artificial seawater containing bacteria.However, the corrosion current density value of CS exposed to the sterile artificial for 10 days was $8 . 5 6 \mu \mathrm { A } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ .In addition,a significant negative shift in corrosion potential from $- 7 3 2 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ (vs SCE) to $- 9 3 8 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ (vs SCE) was observed in sterileartificial seawaterafter1O days due to the continuous degradation and dissolution of the metal [27] and the attack of the chloride ions on the CS surface;while in the presence of bacterium, corrosion potential is shifted toward less negative potentials $\mathrm { \Delta } [ 6 0 \mathrm { m V } ]$ （2 and reached to $- 7 9 2 \mathrm { m V }$ (vs CSE) after 10 days.

To verify the effect of V.neocaledonicus sp.KJ841877 on real systems, we prepared some CS coupons and exposed them to seawater without and with bacteria for one month.The photographic images illustrate a thick rust layer on the surface exposed only to seawater (Fig.3e), whereas a clean-looking inhibitory film formed due to the bacteria was attached to the surface after one month in the presence of bacteria (Fig. 3f).

# 3.2.Mechanism of bacterium and their metabolic byproducts on the corrosion inhibition of carbon steel

To study the mechanism of the corrosion inhibitory effect of bacterium,surface analysis methods such as FTIR,XPS and FESEM were used. FTIR spectrum of a CS sample surface exposed only to sterile artificial seawater(Fig.2A) revealed two peaks at $3 4 0 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and $4 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ which correspond to absorbed water molecules and $\mathsf { \gamma } _ { \mathsf { Y - F e } _ { 2 } \mathsf { O } _ { 3 } }$ .Inthe presence of samples exposed to seawater with the bacteria,four main peaks were detected: $1 6 3 8 . 9 \ : \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ $1 4 9 3 . 6 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ 1 $1 1 3 0 . 4 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and $8 5 4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ，corresponding to iron phosphate,the $\scriptstyle { \mathsf { C } } = 0$ bond of amide I, polysaccharides and $C - 0$ stretching in esters [28],respectively. Schmitt and Flemming identified the spectral range of $1 1 5 0 { - } 7 5 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ as the polysaccharide region [16],so,it appears the polysaccharide was produced by these bacteria and formed complexes with the metal. Reducing the amount of electron acceptors at the interface by binding EPS with Fe(II) and Fe(III) inhibits corrosion [29].

FTIR spectra of EPS extracted from bacterium showed adsorption bands at $1 6 4 1 . 8 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ and $1 4 0 1 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ ,corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of carboxylates in the side chains [30].A strong-intensity band caused by the stretchingvibration of $C - 0 { - } C$ in the backbone of polysaccharides was also found at $1 1 1 2 . 7 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ [31]. Based on these observations,the EPS excreted by this bacterium primarily consisted of exopolysaccharides with numerous hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.Amide groups from proteins were also observed in the FTIR peaks.Organic macromolecular compounds,such as proteins and carbohydrates,can spontaneouslyadsorb onto a solid surface and forman inhibitory layerafter a short exposure time [31],so our results are consistent with free EPS released into bulk solution to compete with bacterial cells for binding sites on the metal surface [32].

The XPS spectrum (Fig.2b) of the CS surface showed a higher percentage of Cand Fe in the presence of the bacteria which indicate the formation of Fe-EPS complexes.In contrast,oxygen from the formation of oxide layers was found on CS surfaces exposed solely to sterile artificial seawater.

The microstructure of the CS surfaces and inhibitive layer were examined by FESEM.Metal surfaces exposed only to sterile artificial seawaterwere covered byan oxide layerwith large cratersafter $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ (Fig.3a),this layer heterogeneously covered the surface depending on the exposure time (Fig.3b).In the presence of bacteria,an intact film layer extensively coated the metal surface after 6 h (Fig.3c) and became thicker with longer exposure time (Fig.3d).

# 3.3.The effect ofEPS produced with bacterium on the corrosion inhibition of carbonsteel

Similarly,we exposed CS samples inartificial seawaterwithout and with $5 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { L }$ of bacterium-produced EPS to examine the corrosion inhibition of EPS.This concentration was selected based on preliminary experiments to determine the optimum inhibitory concentration.The addition of EPS increased the impedance value and inhibited corrosion. The inhibitory effect could be attributed to EPS adsorption at the steel/ solution interface.The corrosion rate also decreased in correlation witha shift in the anodic branch of the polarization curves toward lower current densities.This suggests that EPS behaved as an inhibitive layerand blocked the active sitesavailable for corrosion reaction [33], and the formation of inhibitory Fe-EPS complex layers on the metal surface was the main reason for the corrosion inhibition of the bacteria [6]. The cathodic reaction also decreased, due to oxygen consumption by the bacteria,and this would reduce the corrosion rate.The presence of carbohydrates and amide groups in the EPS and inhibitive layers suggests that EPS could adheres to metal surfaces by these functional groups and decreases the corrosion process by retarding the anodic reaction [34].

# 4. Conclusion

The study of the corrosion inhibitory effect of V. neocaledonicus sp. and EPS produced by this bacterium showed that the bacteriumand itsmetabolic byproduct havea high inhibitory effectagainstcorrosion ofcarbon steel.The inhibitory effect was caused by the formation of aninhibitory layer which covers the entire metal surfaces.The layer is composed of Fe-EPS complexes and strengthens by exposure time. Wepropose that V.neocaledonicus sp.and its EPS can beused as a new,natural, non-toxic,and cost-effective system for controlling corrosion processes of carbon steel.
