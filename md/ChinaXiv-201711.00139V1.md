ABSTRACTAlloys based on non-noble metals could be the next generation of high-performance catalysts for many chemical reactions.

In this work,we report a simple synthesis of $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloys without any component segregation.

The findings reported here are highly helpful to understand the relationship between the synergistic efects in aloys and their catalytic performance,and therefore could provide appropriate strategies to obtain desirable catalysts with improved activity in various catalytic applications.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Alloys have received considerable interest due to their potential applications in various chemical and physical processes， such as hydrogen storage，magnetic sensors，hydrogenation，fuel cell，ammonia decomposition,catalytic reforming，water gas shift reaction and so on[1-4].Noble metal alloys have been generally utilized in catalytic reactions of various fields[5-8]. However,due to the high cost and limited supply of noble metals，the improvement of catalytic effciency and the cost reduction are the top priorities.

Alternatively,alloys based on non-noble metals could be the next generation of high-performance catalysts for many chemical reactions.

Noble-metal free alloys are considered as promising catalysts with low cost，high activity and selectivityl9-11l Owing tothe synergistic ffect of alloying between different metals，the activity and selectivity of alloys can be optimized by controlling the elemental composition. As a consequence, non-noble metal alloys (involving Cu,Fe, Co,and Ni) with different compositions have been synthesized by diverse methods[121. Among all these alloys, CuNi alloys are promising candidates[12-14]. Nevertheles,the reduction potentials for the components of Cu and Ni metals are generally much lower than those of noble metals. As a result,more strenuous reaction conditions are required to prepare CuNi alloys[15-17]. For instance, toxic organic capping agents，solvents,reducing agents and organo-metals have been utilized to increase the reduction potentials.Besides,the differences in reduction potentials for Cu and Ni metals also limit the formation of alloys[18-20l. Therefore,it is necessary to develop simple and green methods to synthesize CuNi alloys with desired compositions.

Based on the above considerations， we report a simple synthesis of Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy without any component segregation. Its success relies on the use of $\mathrm { { C u - N i } }$ oxalate precursors,which are chelated in the proximity by oxalate ligandsl21-23l. Using this strategy,the actual component ratio of the obtained Cuo.5Ni0.5 alloy is consistent with the initial ratio. Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy exhibits high activity in the reduction of $p$ -nitrophenol (4-NP) by sodium borohydride $\mathrm { ( N a B H _ { 4 } ) }$ )in an aqueous solution.

All chemical reagents were used as received without further purification.

# 2.2Synthesis of $\mathbf { C u _ { 0 . 5 } N i _ { 0 . 5 } }$ alloys

$\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy was prepared by thermal decomposition of $\mathrm { { C u - N i } }$ oxalate precursors.In a typical synthesis of $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy,an amount of oxalic acid (4 mmol) was dissolved in $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ acetone at room temperature. $\mathrm { C u } ( \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } { \cdot } 3 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ 0 $\mathrm { ( 0 . 5 ~ m m o l ) }$ ）and $\mathrm { N i } ( \mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } { \cdot } 6 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ 0 $\mathrm { ( 0 . 5 ~ m m o l ) }$ ）were dissolved in $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ acetone at room temperature.Then,the metal nitrate solution was added into the oxalic acid solution,and the mixed solution was stirred for $2 \mathrm { h }$ .Finally, the obtained $\mathrm { { C u - N i } }$ oxalate precipitate was filtered, washed with acetone for several times,and dried overnight at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$

$\mathrm { { C u - N i } }$ oxalate was calcined in a temperature-programmed manner ( $10 \%$ （204号 $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ in Ar as vector gas at a volumetric flow rate of $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m L } ~ \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ using a ramp of $3 \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \ \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ up to $4 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ).The product thus obtained was passivated in a mixed atmosphere ( $1 \%$ （204号 $\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ and $9 9 \%$ Ar)at $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Then, the alloy sample was obtained.

For comparison,pure $\mathtt { C u }$ and Ni metals were also prepared, just adopting the similar procedure to that for alloy sample.

# 2.3Sample characterization

X-ray diffraction (XRD） patterns of the samples were recorded using D/MAX 255O Advance X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation source operated at $3 0 ~ \mathrm { k V }$ and $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m A }$ . Data were collected from $2 \theta$ between $4 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $8 0 ^ { \circ }$ with a step of $0 . 0 2 ^ { \circ }$ at a scanning speed of $5 \ \mathrm { { ^ \circ } / { m i n } }$ . FT-IR spectra of the sample were examined using by a Jasco FT/IR-410 in air at room temperature using 42O Herschel series in KBr dispersion. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS） measurements were performed using ESCALAB250 photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a charge neutralizer and a MgKa X-ray source. Thermogravimetry (TG: Perkin-Elmer) was carried out for the precursor powder in air from 25 to $8 0 0 ^ { \mathrm { { o } C } }$ at a constant heating rate for （204号 $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { ^ { o } C } { \cdot m i n ^ { - 1 } } }$ . Morphologies of the as-synthesized samples were recorded using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with an EDX. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image was recorded on a JEOL 3010 with $3 0 0 \mathrm { k V }$ acceleration voltages. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was carried out on a Shimadzu UV-360o UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer in a wavelength range of $3 0 0 { \sim } 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$

# 2.4Catalytic activity test

$1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of 4-NP aqueous solution $( 2 0 0 \ \mathrm { p p m } )$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of freshly prepared aqueous $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ (0.06 M) were successively added into $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of deionized water in a beaker. Next, $2 \ : \mathrm { m g }$ of catalyst was added into the mixture.The color of the solution changed gradually from yellow to transparent as the reaction proceeded. UV-vis spectrometry was used to monitor the change in absorbance at a time interval of 1 min.

# 3 RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

# 3.1 Characterization of the obtained Cu-Ni oxalates

Cu-Ni oxalates were first prepared prior to the formation of CuNi alloy. The crystal structures of the obtained Cu-Ni oxalates were characterized by XRD. The fresh Cuo.5Nio.5 oxalate was composed of copper oxalate hydrate and nickel oxalate hydrate phase, since the XRD peaks could be indexed to $\mathrm { C u C } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ · xHO (JCPDS 21-0297) and orthorhombic phase ${ \mathrm { N i C } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { O } } _ { 4 } { \cdot } 2 { \mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { O } }$ (JCPDS 25-0582), respectively[23]. From the data comparison between nickel oxalate (Fig.lc)and Cuo.5Nio.5 oxalate (Fig.1b) with a higher nickel content, the peaks of Cuo.5Nio.5 oxalate were seen characteristic of the nickel oxalate hydrate in an orthorhombic phase. The XRD peak at $2 \theta = 1 8 . 5 8 ^ { 0 }$ became more pronounced with the increase of Ni content, which could be ascribed to the diffraction of plane (2O2) of the nickel oxalate.

In order to further determine the coordination environment of $\mathrm { { C u - N i } }$ oxalates, FT-IR spectra of the oxalate samples were recorded (Fig. 2). It can be seen that allsamples showed similar absorption spectrum. The strong band located at $3 3 7 0 ~ \mathrm { c m ^ { - 1 } }$ is assigned to the stretching vibration of $\mathrm { O - H }$ group. The presence of carboxylate group in oxalate samples is confirmed by two bands at $1 6 2 0 ~ \mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ for the asymmetric stretching vibrations and $1 3 6 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for the symmetric stretching vibrations[24]. The band at $1 3 1 7 ~ \mathrm { c m ^ { - 1 } }$ is assigned to the symmetric $ { \gamma } (  { \mathbf { C } } \mathrm { - }  { \mathbf { O } } )$ , which indicates the presence of bridging oxalates with all four oxygen atoms coordinated to the metal atoms[25, 26].

In this work, Cuo.5Nio.5 aloy was synthesized by thermal decomposition of oxalates.In order to determine the suitable calcination temperature,allsamples were studied by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Fig. 3).TG curves of Fig.3 clearly showed that alloxalates underwent three stages.The first stage observed in the temperature range of $3 5 { \sim } 1 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ corresponds to the loss of adsorbed water. The second one begins at about $1 0 0 ~ ^ { \mathrm { ~ o ~ C ~ } }$ and ends at about $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ，which is atributed to the release of crystal water from $\mathrm { M e C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } { \cdot } m H _ { 2 } O }$ to $\mathrm { M e C } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ . The third one begins at about $2 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and ends at about $4 5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ， showing a mass loss closer to the theoretical one for the decomposition of $\mathrm { M e C } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ to MexOy and Me with a release of $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and CO gasses[27-29].Based on the reduction temperature of oxalates in TG analysis，the calcination temperature was set at $4 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for the subsequent alloying.

# 3.2 Characterization of the obtained Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy

The crystal structures of pure $\mathtt { C u }$ and $\mathrm { N i }$ metals and $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy were monitored by XRD.Fig. 4 shows the standard difraction data for metal Cu and Ni.The diffraction peaks of all samples are assigned to the (11)，(2O0) and (220) planes,respectively，as confirmed by the standard data of fcc structure for $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloyl12,30l. The diffraction peaks for alloy sample are distributed between those of pure copper and pure nickel, which confirms the formation of solid solution between Cu and Ni.Further, the content of $\mathtt { C u }$ in

Cuo.5Nio.5 aloy was estimated based on the Vegard's law that claims a linear relation between lattice parameter of an aloy and its composition.For most catalytic reactions,the surface area of catalyst is important because of its relevance to the absorption and desorption of reactants.BETdata of the as-prepared sample are extremely low $( < 5 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { g } )$ ,which could help one to eliminate the influence of contact area on the catalytic performance.

Fig.5a shows SEM image of Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy. SEM image clearly illustrates that the bimetallic particles are primarily spherical in nature,and the small particles were self-assembled to form bigger aggregates.TEM images further confirm that the obtained Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy was spherical morphology.Fig. 5f shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy. The interfringe distance of $0 . 2 0 5 \ \mathrm { n m }$ is slightly smaller that of $0 . 2 0 8 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ for Cu (11l） spacing,but larger than that of $0 . 2 0 3 \ \mathrm { n m }$ for Ni（111） spacing. To analyze the structure and elemental composition of the alloys， SEM-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of the $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy are presented in Fig. 5 $( \mathsf { c } \widetilde { \mathsf { \Gamma } } \mathrm { e } )$ ，which confirms the high dispersion of $\mathtt { C u }$ and Ni in forming alloy structures without significant segregation of each component. As shown in Fig. 5b, the molar ratio of $\mathtt { C u }$ to Ni is about 5O:50,which agrees well with the initial ratio. This suggests that the metal precursors were reduced completely and transformed into Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy. The above analyses further confirm the successful preparation of Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy.

The chemical states of $\mathtt { C u }$ and $\mathrm { N i }$ in Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy were further determined by XPS spectra. In the full spectrum of $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy (Fig. 6a), the signals of C 1s, O 1s, Ni $2 p$ ,and $\mathrm { C u } ~ 2 p$ can be clearly seen in the binding energy region from O to $1 2 0 0 { \mathrm { ~ e V } } .$ XPS spectra of $\mathrm { C u } ~ 2 p$ (Fig. 6b) exhibit two strong peaks at 932.3 and $9 5 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { e V } ,$ ，corresponding to $\mathrm { C u } 2 p _ { 3 / 2 }$ and $\mathrm { C u } 2 p _ { 1 / 2 }$ ,respectively. The binding energy value indicated the presence of metallic $\mathrm { C u } ^ { 0 [ 1 3 , 3 1 ] }$ ，whereas,the minor peaks located at $9 3 4 . 4 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ and low intensity satellites at $9 4 0 { \sim } 9 4 5 \ \mathrm { e V }$ can be attributed to ${ \mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ ，as reported elsewherel32-34].Ni $2 p$ spectra (Fig. 6c） also exhibited spin-orbital peaks. The photoelectron peak at $8 5 2 . 5 \mathrm { e V }$ is assigned to $\mathrm { N i } ^ { 0 [ 3 0 ] }$ . Besides this, the signal related to $\mathrm { N i } ^ { 2 + }$ was also detected at a binding energy of $8 5 5 . 8 ~ \mathrm { e V }$ [30,35,36]. Therefore, Ni species was partially oxidized to form NiO. In addition to these peaks,a shake-up satellite peak in the region of $8 6 0 { \sim } 8 6 5 \ \mathrm { e V }$ also confirms the existence of small amount of $\mathrm { N i O } ^ { [ 3 7 ] }$ . The presence of copper and nickel oxides in the alloy suggests that a thin oxidized layer was formed, which is conducive to the stability of alloy.

# 3.3Application of $\mathbf { C u _ { 0 . 5 } N i _ { 0 . 5 } }$ alloy for catalytic reduction of 4-NP

Reduction of 4-NP by $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ in aqueous solution is a model reaction[38,39l that can be used for examining the catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalyst. For this purpose, the advantages of $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy were explored to study the reduction of 4-NP to $p$ -aminophenol（4-AP） in the presence of $\mathrm { \Delta N a B H _ { 4 } }$ at room temperature.As observed in Fig.7a, 4-NP solution exhibited a strong absorption peak at $3 1 7 \mathrm { n m }$ ，which is remarkably red-shifted to $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ when treated with an aqueous solution of $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ only[40l. At the same time,the color of the solution changed from light to dark yellow.The absorption peak immediately shifted from 317 to $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ，probably because of the formation of $p$ -nitrophenolate ions under alkaline condition with $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } ^ { [ 4 1 ] } }$ . It should be noted that $\mathrm { { N a B H _ { 4 } } }$ is not able to reduce 4-NP without catalysts, even though it is considered as the electron donor and hydrogen source. The peak at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ stayed unchanged for over 4 min in the absence of the catalyst (Fig.7b)，which demonstrates that the reduction reaction did not proceed without catalyst.

The catalytic activities of the as-prepared Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy and the pure Cu and Ni metals were compared in the reaction of 4-NP reduction.Fig.8 shows the time-dependent absorption of solution over the catalyst in the presence of excess NaBH4. The maximum absorbance peak at $4 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ gradually declines as the reduction reaction time proceeds. Meanwhile, the color of the solution is also gradually dropped from dark yellow to colorlessness，accompanying with a concomitant increase of the peak at $3 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，which indicates the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. The UV-visible absorption spectra showed an isosbestic point between two absorption peaks,suggesting that 4-NP compound was gradually converted to 4-AP without any side reaction. As indicated from UV-visible absorption spectra in Fig. 8a, it took $2 4 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ for $\mathtt { C u }$ to complete the catalytic reaction. For Ni (Fig.8b)，more than $4 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ is needed for completing the catalytic reaction，which demonstrates that the catalytic activity of Ni was obviously lower. Comparatively, for $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy (Fig. 8c), the complete reaction time dramatically decreased to $1 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ， which showed a great enhancement of the catalytic activity. The reduction reaction completes at much shorter time for bimetallc aloy nanocrystals when compared to monometallic Cu and Ni.

To figure out the role of $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy in this reduction conversion, the kinetic analysis of these reactions was carried $\mathrm { o u t } _ { \tt a }$ as described from the temporal decay of these peaks. The ratio of $\mathbf { C } _ { \mathrm { t } }$ to $\mathrm { C } _ { 0 }$ ( $\mathrm { \overrightarrow { C } _ { t } }$ and $\mathrm { C } _ { 0 }$ are 4-NP concentrations at time t and O,respectively）was measured from the relative intensity of the respective absorbance $\mathrm { { A _ { t } / A _ { 0 } } }$ . As shown in Fig. 8d, without catalysts,the maximum absorption peak remains unchanged, indicating that the presence of $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ alone cannot initiate the conversion reaction even with a large excess amount. Alternatively,introducing pure Cu or $\mathrm { N i }$ into the reaction system gives a moderate conversion,and thus pure Cu or Ni is active for the reduction of 4-NP.It is observed from Fig.8d that the reduction reaction completes at much shorter time over the $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy when compared to monometallic

Cu and Ni particles.

In order to study the activity of the catalyst,the pseudo-first-order reaction with regard to 4-NP concentration is used to evaluate the kinetic rate constant.The kinetic equation for the reduction can be written as,

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \frac { \mathrm { d } G \mathrm { t } } { \mathrm { d t } } = \mathrm { k } C _ { \mathrm { t } } \qquad \mathrm { o r } \ln ( \frac { G \mathrm { t } } { \bar { c } \bar { 0 } } ) = \ln ( \frac { \bar { A } \bar { \mathrm { t } } } { A \bar { 0 } } ) = - \mathrm { k t } } \end{array}
$$

where $\mathrm { C _ { t } }$ is the concentration of 4-NP at time‘t’ and $\mathbf { \hat { k } } ^ { \prime }$ is the rate constant, which can be obtained from the decrease in the peak intensity at $4 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ with time.The catalytic performance of $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy，the monometallic $\mathtt { C u }$ and Ni particleswere obtained by calculating the rate constants from UV-Vis absorption spectra. The rate constants (k)of the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP were estimated from diffusion-coupled first order reaction kinetics. The $\mathbf { k }$ value obtained for the reduction of 4-NP for Cuo.5Nio.5 alloy is $0 . 3 1 \ \mathrm { m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ ,about twice higher than $0 . 1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } ^ { - 1 } }$ for $\mathrm { C u }$ and $0 . 1 2 \mathrm { m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ for Ni. According to the rate constant, the catalytic activity of the Cuo.5Nio.5 aloy for the reduction of 4-NP is higher than other noble metals reported in other literaturel42, 43l.This could be the synergistic effectbetween $\mathtt { C u }$ and Ni in alloys that plays a leading role in improving the catalytic properties. In the reduction of aromatic nitro-compounds, it is believed that $p$ -nitrophenolate ions are adsorbed by the catalyst,and brohydride ions react with the catalyst and transfer a surface hydrogen species and electrons to them, thereby resulting in an eficient reduction of $\left. - \mathbf { N O } _ { 2 } \right.$ group[44l. The interaction between Cu and Ni here may facilitate the formation of the intermediate species and the transition of electrons.

Stability and reusability are of great importance for the practical applications of catalysts. The recyclability of catalytic reduction is carried out for $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy for five successive cycles,as presented in Fig. 9. After five cycles, the catalytic activity retains high as $82 \%$ , showing a high stability for $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy. The slight decreases in catalytic activity for the fourth and fifth cycles are probably due to the loss of catalyst during the separation and reuse of metal.

# 4 CONCLUSION

$\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy was prepared by thermal decomposition of Cu-Ni oxalates.The key was to the use of Cu-Ni oxalate precursors,and the metal precursors were reduced completely and transformed into alloys. The actual component ratios of the obtained $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy are consistent with the initial ratios. In comparison with the monometallic Ni and Cu, $\mathrm { C u } _ { 0 . 5 } \mathrm { N i } _ { 0 . 5 }$ alloy exhibits an excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the reduction of $p$ -nitrophenol by sodium borohydride in an aqueous solution,which might be related to the strong interaction between Cu and Ni. Therefore,CuNi alloys merited with low cost, simple preparation,and high activity,are uncovered to have a great potential in replacing noble metals for other catalytic applications.
