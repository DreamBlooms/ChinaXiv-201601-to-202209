distant metastatic cancer.Despite recent advances in diagnostics and therapy, CRC remains a major health problem worldwide. One of the major obstacles to effective treatment of CRC is the high metastasis and recurrence rates as a result of the intrinsic feature of high migration and invasion ability of CRC cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of CRC metastasis is critical for developing new antimetastasis strategies.

Slits (Slitl-3） are secreted,extracellular matrix-associated glycoproteins and ligands for the neuronal guidance receptor Roundabout family (Robol-4). The Slit-Robo pathway is crucial for neuronal guidance and cell migration.2-5 Recent data show that this pathway also plays important roles in many physiological and pathological processes outside of the nervous system,especially in human tumorigenesis.7 Slit2 expression is frequently downregulated in a variety of cancer types, including CRC.’ However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Slit-Robo signaling in human cancers are not clear.

Although efforts have been made to elucidate the role of Slit-Robo signaling in CRC,the resultsare contradictory.8-10 For example,Dallol et al.reported that Slit2 is frequently inactivated in CRC and suppresses the growth of CRC cells, whereas Zhou et al. showed that the N-terminal domain of Slit2 could induce malignant transformation of colorectal epithelial cell and tumor metastasis.Interestingly,a recent paper revealed that Slit-Robo could inhibit CRC cell migration.10 Therefore,further study is necessary to elucidate the precise role and underlying mechanisms of Slit-Robo signaling in CRC.

# What'snew?

The Slit-Robo pathway functions inaxon guidance and cellmigrationand influences various pathological processesoutside the nervous system,including tumorigenesis.Here,the Roboligand and putative tumor suppresor Slit2 was found to serve as aninhibitorofcellmigration incolorectal cancer (CRC).Its inhibitoryactivitywas dependentonRobo1and was enhanced byoverexpressionof USP33.USP33 mediated Slit2activityvia Robo1deubiquitinationand stabilization.Inaddition,Slit2and USP33 expression was reduced in human CRC tissue.The data suggest that USP33 is a tumor suppressor in CRC and that its expression is predictive of survival.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33),a newly identified Robol-interacting molecule,is required for midline crossing and the responsiveness of commissural axons to Slit and for Slit-Robo signaling in inhibiting breast cancer cell migration.1l12 These datasuggestan importantroleof USP33 in Slit signaling. In this study,we present evidence that Slit2 is downregulated in CRC and inhibits CRC cell migration in a Robo-dependent manner.USP33 mediates the inhibitory function of Slit2 on CRC cell migration by deubiquitinating and stabilizing Robol.Interestingly,in CRC cells,Slit2 treatment also results in an increase in Robol on the cell surface. Consistently，USP33 expression is downregulated in CRC samples and appears to be an independent prognostic factor for CRC.

# Material and Methods

# Human tissues and cell lines

Seventy-nine de-identified human primary CRC tissues and their adjacent noncancerous tissues (NCTs) were collected between 2004 and 20o8 at the Affliated Hospital of Jiangnan University and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The detailed information of patients is included in Supporting Information Table S1.All of the samples were obtained following national guidelines with informed consent and with approvals from the Clinical Research Ethics Committees of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center.

HEK-293 cell line and six human CRC cell lines,including HCT8,HCT116,LoVo,Caco2,DLD1 and HT29,were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in media (Hyclone） supplemented with $1 0 \%$ fetal bovine serum (Gibco).

# Antibodies,plasmids,small interfering RNA and stable cell lines

Mouse anti-Flag (M2),anti-beta-actin and anti-beta-tubulin were from Sigma-Aldrich;mouse anti-HA (16B12),anti-GFP and anti-myc (9E1o） were from Covance Laboratories; antiUb was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology； anti-Robol was from Abcam;anti-USP33 was from Bethyl Laboratories. The Robol-HA，Robol-myc，RoboN(the soluble extracellular domain of Robol)，GFP-USP33 and Flag-tagged ubiquitin (Flag-UB)plasmid constructsweregenerated as described.5,12-14 Slit2 and GFP-USP33 were subcloned into the lentivirus plasmid pLVX-IRES-Neo (Clontech).Duplex small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from GenePharma (Shanghai, China).1² Plasmids and siRNA transfection were performed using Lipofectamine 2ooo (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells stably expressing Robol-HA,RoboN or Slit2- myc were constructed as previously described.5 The detailed information of conditioned medium(CM) was described in Supporting Information Materials and Methods.LoVo cells stably expressing Slit2,GFP-USP33 or Slit2/GFP-USP33 were constructed using lentivirus transduction and G418 selection.

# RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis

Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen） according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Japan),and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were conducted using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) with beta-actin as an internal control. Both qRTPCR and radioactive PCR as previously describedl' were used to detect different gene expression in the CRC cell lines. The primers used for PCR analysis are listed in the Supporting Information Data (Supporting Information Table S2).

# Promoter methylation analysis

Genomic DNA was isolated from CRC cell lines,CRC tissues and adjacent NCTs using General Allgene kit (CWbio, China).Genomic DNA samples were bisulfite-modified as previously described.15 The bisulfite-treated DNA samples were amplified using bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) primers located in the promoter region of human Slit2 gene. The purified BSP products were directly sequenced with the methylation status of each CpG site determined as previously described. To perform methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis,the bisulfite-treated DNA was subjected to PCR,and the PCR products were analyzed using $2 \%$ agarose gel electrophoresis.The primers for the BSP and MSP assays were designed using MethPrimer (http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/; Supporting Information Table S2).

# Cell viability and cell migration assays

Cell viability analysis was performed using the MTT assay.A modified wound-healing assay for cell migration was performed as we have described previously,1' and the detailed information was presented in the Supporting Information Materials and Methods.To mimic the in vivo migration and invasion behavior of tumor cells,a three-dimensional coculture assay was performed as previously described.13,16 In addition,cell migration assay was performed using the Transwell method as previously described.17 For the in vivo metastasisassays, $2 \ \times \ 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ LoVo cells stably expressing Slit2, USP33 or the control vector were suspended in $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of PBS and were injected into the caudal vein of each nude mouse. The mice were sacrificed aftera period of 5-6 weeks and examined for the lung metastasis of tumors.

# Western blotting,immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical staining

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (IP） analyses were performed as previously described.1,2 To detect the expression levels of the USP33 and Robol protein,immunohistochemical staining was performed on $4 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ sections of paraffin-embedded CRC tissues as previously described.17

# Deubiquitination assay

HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-UB,Robol-myc and GFP-USP33 or siUSP33. After $4 8 \ \mathrm { h r }$ ，cellswere treated with $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { M }$ MG132 (Peptides International） for $6 \ \mathrm { h r }$ and then lysed using IP buffer( $( 1 \%$ Triton-100, $1 0 \%$ glycerol and $1 \ \mathrm { m M }$ EDTA in TBS buffer). The cell lysates were incubated with anti-Flag to precipitate Flag-tagged ubiquitinated proteins for $3 \ \mathrm { h r }$ ，The cell lysates were then incubated with protein A/G agarose beads for $3 { \mathrm { ~ h r } }$ .Following washes,the beads were eluted in SDS loading buffer,separated by SDS-PAGE and detected using Western blotting.

# Cell surface biotinylation assay

Robol-HA-expressing HCT116 cells were plated in $1 0 \mathrm { - c m }$ dishes and transfected with USP33-specific siRNA (siUSP33) or a control siRNA (siCtrl). Forty-eight hours after transfection，the cells were treated with recombinant Slit2 for 10 min.Then,cell surface proteins were biotinylated and isolated using Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the published protocol.1' Biotinylated cell surface proteins were examined by immunoblotting using anti-HA.

# Statistical analysis

The results are presented as the mean values $\pm \operatorname { S E M }$ The data were subjected to Student's t-test,Mann-Whitney $U$ or Kruskall-Wallis test. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method,and the log-rank test was applied for comparisons.The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CIs),representing the overall relative risk of death that was associated with different variables.A $\boldsymbol { p }$ value of less than O.O5 was considered statistically significant. The Graphpad prism 5.0 software(GraphPad Software) and SPSS

16.0 package (SPSS) were used for statistical analyses and scientific graphing,respectively.

# Results

# Slit2 expression was downregulated in CRC

The mRNA levels of known genes in Slit-Robo signaling were examined in six CRC cell lines using radioactive PCR The Slit2 gene expression was detected in HT29 cells,but onlyat low levels in LoVo,HCT116 and Caco2 cells,and not detectable in the other two cell lines. Robol expression was detected in HT29 and LoVo cells (Supporting Information Fig. Sla).Based on the Slit2 and Robol expression levels and the in vitro migration ability of these CRC cell lines，we focused on LoVo and HCT116 for the subsequent analysis.

To assess the expression of Slit2 and Robol in CRC samples,we first analyzed their expression in a published CRC microarray data set (Supporting Information Table S3).18 Compared to NCTs ${ \mathit { n } } = 4 3 { \mathit { \ ! } }$ ),the Slit2 mRNA levels were significantlydownregulatedinCRCtissues（ $( n = 1 8 0$ ） $( p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ，Fig.la)，whereas no significant difference was found in the Robo1 mRNA levels between CRC and NCT samples.We then used qRT-PCR to validate the downregulation of Slit2 mRNA in an independent CRC cohort we collected.Ourdata revealed thatSlit2 expressionwas downregulated by more than 1.5-fold in $5 5 . 7 \%$ (44/79）of CRC tumors compared with their corresponding NCTs $( p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ，Fig. 1b).No significant association was found between the Slit2 expression and patient age,gender,tumor stage,tumor size,or survival.

# The promoter of the Slit2 gene was hypermethylated in CRC

To investigate the mechanisms underlying the suppression of Slit2 expression in CRC,we first analyzed datasets obtained from an online database (http://www.cbioportal.org/publicportal/).Genetic mutations in the human Slit2 gene was detected in approximately $4 \% - 7 \%$ of tumors among different CRC cohorts,suggesting that other mechanisms may result in Slit2 inactivation in CRC (Supporting Information Fig. S2).Promoter hypermethylation is an important mechanism that results in gene silencing and has been reported to mediate the Slit2 inactivating.8,19 A negative relationship was observed between the Slit2 mRNA and promoter methylation levels (Pearson $r = - 0 . 3 4 6$ $\textstyle P < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ，Fig.lc)， suggesting a role of DNA hypermethylation in silencing Slit2 expression in CRC.We then examined the promoter methylation status of Slit2 in CRC cell lines and clinical samples.The Slit2 promoter was found to be methylated in five of the six cell lines based on the BSP results (Fig.ld).CRC cell lines with a hypermethylated Slit2 promoter showed no detectable Slit2 mRNA expression (DLD1,HCT8),and CRC cells with a partially methylated Slit2 promoter showed reduced Slit2 mRNA expression (HCT116,Caco2 and LoVo),whereas HT29 cells with an unmethylated Slit2 promoter showed the highest Slit2 expression among the six cell lines (Fig. $1 d$ and

The promoter methylation status of Slit2 was also investigated in CRC cell lines and 28 paired CRC/NCT tissues as well as five normal colonic epithelia samples using a MSP assay. The results showed that the methylation ratio of Slit2 in CRC tissues (21/28, $7 5 . 0 \%$ ） was significantly higher than that in NCTs (13/28, $4 6 . 4 \%$ $p = 0 . 0 2 9 )$ ，whereas all five normal colonic epithelia samples were unmethylated (Fig.le). Consistent with the BSP results,

5 of the 6 CRC cell lines also showed positive results of MSP except HT29. Importantly,the CRC tumors with hypermethylated Slit2 showed decreased Slit2 expression compared with those with hypomethylated Slit2 (Supporting Information Fig. S3). To confirm that the reduced expression of Slit2 was a result of promoter hypermethylation,we treated LoVo and HCT116 cells with a demethylating agent，5-aza-dC. Slit2 expression was restored in both cell lines treated with 5- aza-dC (Fig.lf). Together, these data demonstrate that promoter hypermethylation is an important mechanism for silencing Slit2 expression in CRC.

# Slit2 inhibits CRC cell migration in a Robo-dependent manner

In a significant fraction of CRC samples, Slit2 was downregulated through promoterhypermethylation， suggestinga tumor suppressive role of Slit2 in CRC.We used a modified wound-healing assay to examine the role of Slit2 in CRC cell migration.11 LoVo cells treated with Slit2 showed decreased cell migration compared with the mock control (Fig.2a). To evaluate the involvement of Robo in Slit2 signaling in CRC cells,RoboN,the soluble extracellular domain of Robol that blocks Slit-Robo signaling,4,5was used together with Slit in the wound-healing assay. The addition of RoboN effectively blocked the inhibitory effect of Slit2 on CRC cell migration (Fig.2a).To confirm the requirement of Robo in Slit function in CRC cells,we performed cell migration analyses using HCT1l6 without detectable expression of Robol or Robo2. Treating HCT116 cells with recombinant Slit2 had no detectable effects on their migration; however,ectopic expression of Robol restored the inhibitory function of Slit2 on the migration of HCT116 cells (Fig. 2b).

To further investigate the effect of Slit2 on CRC cell migration and invasion,a three-dimensional coculture assay was performed.Migration of LoVo cells was reduced when cocultured in collagen/Matrigel matrix with HEK293 cell aggregates secreting Slit2 compared with cells cocultured with control HEK293 cell aggregates (Fig. 2c). In addition，we examined the effect of Slit2 in LoVo cells using a Transwell assay following transfection with Slit2-expressing plasmid or a control vector. Slit2 expression reduced cell migration and invasion in the Transwell assay (Fig.2d).

We also examined the effects of Slit2 on cell proliferation. No detectable effects of Slit2 on cell proliferation were observed in any of 6 CRC cell lines (Supporting Information Fig. S4).Taken together,these data demonstrate that Slit2 inhibits CRC cell migration ina Robo-dependent mechanism.

# USP33 interacts with Robo1 and mediates Slit2 signaling in CRC cells

Our previous studies have shown that USP33 interacts with Robol in neurons and breast cancer cells.l2,13 Western blotting analyses revealed that USP33 expression was detectable in most of the examined CRC cells,including LoVo and HCT1l6 cells (Supporting Information Fig. S1). To test the interaction between Robol and USP33 in CRC cells,we performed co-IP assays.Plasmids of Robol-HA,GFP-USP33, or empty vector were cotransfected into HCT116 or LoVo cells.After IP using an anti-HA antibody，USP33 was detected only in the immunoprecipitates of the cells expressing both the Robol and USP33 proteins (Fig.3a).

These results show that Robol interacts with USP33 in CRC cells.

To investigate the role of USP33 in mediating Slit-Robo signaling in CRC cells,we increased or inhibited USP33 expression in LoVo cells by transfecting the GFP-USP33 plasmid or siUSP33.Enhanced USP33 expression increased Slit2 inhibition of cell migration (Fig. 3b),whereas knocking down USP33 blocked the inhibitory effect of Slit on cell migration (Fig.3c).To identify the impact of Slit2 and USP33 on in vivo metastasis of CRC cells,LoVo cells stably expressing Slit2 and/or USP33 were injected into the caudal vein of athymic BALB/c nude mice. Ectopic expression of Slit2 sig nificantly reduced the number of lung metastasis sites,and USP33 overexpression enhanced the inhibitory effect of Slit2 on tumor metastasis (Fig. $3 d$ and Supporting Information Fig. S5).Collectively,these data support a key role of USP33 in mediating Slit signaling in CRC cells.

# USP33 deubiquitinates and stabilizes Robo1

To examine the mechanism of USP33 in regulating Slit-Robo signaling,we examined the levels of ubiquitinylated Robol after cotransfecting Flag-tagged ubiquitin (Flag-UB） with GFP-USP33 or siUSP33 in HCT116 cells.Following IP of

Robol-myc using a monoclonal anti-myc,ubiquitinylated Robol wasdetected using anti-Flag. Overexpression of USP33 reduced,whereas knocking-down USP33 increased the level of ubiquitinylated Robol (Fig. 4a).Western blotting analysesrevealed that inhibition of USP33expression decreased whereas overexpression of USP33 increased the Robol protein levels in CRC cells (Fig. 4b).These results show that USP33 mediates Slit-Robo signaling by deubiquitinating and stabilizing Robol in CRC cells (Supporting Information Fig. S6).

# USP33 is required for the redistribution of Robo1 to the plasma membrane following Slit stimulation

We have reported that Slit2 stimulates the redistribution of Robol to the plasma membrane in an USP33-dependent manner in breast cancer and HEK cels.1l To examine the distribution Robol protein in CRC cells,we performed a cell surface protein biotinylation assay in HCT116 cells following downregulation of USP33 using siRNA.As shown in Fig. 4c, the cell surface levels of Robol significantly increased $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ after Slit2 treatment,and this Slit2-stimulated increase in cell-surface Robo1 was diminished when USP33 was knocked down by siUSP33.

# USP33 expression was positively correlated with Robo1 expression in CRC tissues

To examine the potential relationship between USP33 and Robol expression in clinical CRC samples,we checked their protein expression in 42 CRC tumors.The protein expression of Robol and USP33 was observed in $5 8 . 3 \%$ (24/42）and $6 4 . 3 \%$ (27/42）of CRC tumors,respectively(Table 1 and Supporting Information Fig. S7). The protein expression of Robol in the CRC tissues was positively correlated with the USP33 expression (Spearman $r = 0 . 3 5 9$ ， $p = 0 . 0 2 0 \mathrm { , }$ ，suggesting that USP33 acts as a regulator of Robol protein expression in clinical CRC tumors.The USP33 expression ratio was lower in CRC( $6 4 . 3 \%$ ，27/42） than in NCT( $8 3 . 3 \%$ ，35/42) $( p$ $= 0 . 0 4 7 \rangle$ .Although the Robol expression ratio was lower in CRC $( 5 8 . 3 \% , \ 2 4 / 4 2 )$ ）thaninNCT $( 6 9 . 0 \%$ ，29/42)，the difference was not statistical significant $( p = 0 . 2 5 8 )$ ：

# USP33 expression is decreased in CRC samples and low USP33 expression predicts poor survival

We assessed the USP33 mRNA expression in two different CRC cohorts.We first analyzed its expression in a published human CRC microarray data set.18 USP33 mRNA levels were reduced in CRCs compared with corresponding NCTs $( p < 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ 1 Lower USP33 mRNA levels were associated with lymph node metastasis(Spearman $r = - 0 . 2 2 0$ ， $\begin{array} { r l r } { p } & { { } = } & { 0 . 0 0 3 ) } \end{array}$ and more advanced CRC staging (Spearman $r = - 0 . 2 3 9$ $p = 0 . 0 0 1$ ; Fig. 5a and 5b).Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that lower USP33 mRNA levels were associated with shorter overall survival ${ \mathrm { \Delta } } _ { { P } } = 0 . 0 0 8 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ Fig. 5d).After adjustment for age,gender, T stage,N stage,M stage and p53 mutation status,Cox multivariate analyses showed that the USP33 mRNA level was an independent prognostic factor for CRC survival. Tumors with higher USP33 expression levels presented lower death risk( $\mathrm { { \cdot H R } } = 0 . 4 9 1$ ， $9 5 \%$ $\mathrm { C I } = 0 . 2 7 8 \mathrm { - } 0 . 8 7 0$ ， $p = 0 . 0 1 5 )$ .To further assess the value of USP33 in CRC prognosis,we examined its mRNA expression in samples from an independent cohort of 79 CRCs (Figs.5c and 5e).Approximately $5 0 \%$ of these CRC tumors showed decreased USP33levelscompared with theircorresponding NCTs （204号 $( p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ，Fig.5c).Higher USP33 expression was correlated with better survival probability $( p = 0 . 0 2 8$ ，Fig. 5e).These data support USP33 as a new prognostic factor for CRC.

# Discussion

Slit-Robo signaling plays an important role in regulating the critical process of cell migration in a variety of tissue types in addition to its role in neuronal guidance in the nervous system.6,20 In this study,we demonstrated that Slit2 is downregulated in CRC samples and inhibits CRC cell migration in a Robodependent manner.In CRC cells,USP33 interacts with Robol and mediates the inhibitory activity of Slit2 on CRC cell migration by deubiquitinating and stabilizing Robol. In addition, USP33 is required for the increased redistribution of Robol to the plasma membrane in response to Slit2 treatment. USP33 expression is reduced in CRC samples.Lower USP33 expression correlates with poorer prognosis in CRC patients.These data support the tumor suppressive roles of Slit2 and USP33 in CRC.

Previous studies have shown that Slit2 expression was downregulated in human cancers,including CRC. The first evidence that Slit-Robo signaling may be involved in cancer came from a study by Sundaresan et al.21 They reported homozygous deletions at the 3pl2 locus,which is the chromosomal region in which the human Robol gene resides,in breast and lung cancer.Further studies have revealed that a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Slit2 gene locus $( 4 9 2 5 -$ 26)was frequently found in breast carcinoma,cervical carcinoma,lung carcinoma, mesothelioma and cervical cancer.22-24 Our analyses show that approximately $4 \% - 7 \%$ of CRC samples carried Slit2 mutations (Supporting Information Fig. S2).Furthermore,a common mechanism for silencing Slit2 expression in human cancers appears to be promoter hypermethylation. Epigentic inactivation of the Slit2 and Slit3 genes has_been reported in a wide range of human。ccers.78,9 Consistentwithprevious reports,827our data show that extensive promoter hypermethylation of Slit2 is detected in CRC tissues，suggesting that promoter hypermethylation is an important mechanism for Slit2 silencing in CRC.Interestingly,the Slit2 methylation status was proposed to be a new CRC biomarker in a recent work.28 Although overwhelming evidence has shown Slit downreg a few reported that the Slit genes were upregulated in some types of human cancers.30,31 The controversial results，even in the same type of tumor,29,30 may be due to the small case numbers in these studies or different tumor types.Further studies are necessary to resolve this controversy.

Slit2 regulates cell migration in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. No significant effect of Slit2 on cell proliferation was detected in CRC cells.Our data demonstrated that Robo-positive CRC cells treated with recombinant Slit2 showed attenuated cell migration; and Slit2 lost its inhibitory activity on cell migration in Robo-negative CRC cells.In addition, Slit2 inhibition of cell migration was reversed by treatment with soluble Robo extracellular domain. These results demonstrate that Slit2 inhibits CRC cell migration in a Robo-dependent manner.

A number of Robo-interacting proteins, including Abl,32 Dock,33 ERK1/2,34 srGAPs1³ and Vilse,35 have been identified that may mediate Slit-Robo signaling in different systems. USP33,a recently identified Robol-interacting molecule,is required for Slit-Robo signaling in regulating the midline crossing of commissural neuron axons12 and in suppressing breast cancer cell migration.11 USP33 was originally identified as a downstream target for ubiquitination and degradation by $\mathrm { \ p V H L }$ E3ligase.14Several proteins，including DIO2,36 ADRB2,37 hSP56,38 beta-arestin,39 RALB40 and CP110,41 have been identified as USP33-interacting partners,indicating extensive biological functions of USP33 in human physiological and pathological processes.In this study，we demonstrated that USP33 is downrgulated in CRC samples and is required for Slit2 signaling in suppressing CRC cell migration.USP33 mediates Slit2 signaling by deubiquitinating and stabilizing Robol．In addition，USP33 is required for the redistribution of Robol to the cell surface in response to Slit2 treatment,which was previously reported in breast cancer cells.1l The data presented in this study demonstrate that USP33 utilizes two different mechanisms to mediate Slit signaling in CRC cells,stabilizing the Robol protein and regulating the cell surface localization of Robol.Based on these results,we propose a model for the Slit-Robo-USP33 signal transduction pathway in CRC cells (Supporting Information Fig. S4).In our previous study,we showed that USP33 was required for the Slit2-stimulated redistribution of Robol to the cell surface in breast cancer cells.However,USP33 did not affect Robol protein levels in breast cancer cells.11 These data suggest that different types of cancer cells may use different combinations of molecular pathways.

Recent reports proposed other molecular mechanisms by which Slit-Robo signaling regulate CRC tumorigenesis. Two groups reported different results on the impact of Slit-Robo signaling in CRC cells. Zhou et al.’ showed that treatment with the amino-terminal domain of Slit2 induced malignant transformation of colorectal epithelial cells through Hakaimediated E-cad ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation during colorectal epithelial cell carcinogenesis,and proposed thatSlit-Robosignalingmayinducetheepithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)， tumor growth and liver metastasis. On the contrary,Chen et al.1° reported that Slit2 inhibited CRC cell migration and EMT by negatively regulating AKT-GSK3β signaling.A similar function of Slit2 in inhibition of cell migration via $\beta$ -catenin has been reported in breast cancer cells.42 It is critical to have more systematic studies to elucidate the role of Slit-Robo signaling in CRC.

Our detailed analyses in different CRC cohorts confirmed the downregulation of USP33 expression in CRC samples and revealed that USP33 mRNA levels were negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis and tumor TNM stages.

Higher USP33 expression is associated with longer patient survival,and further analyses suggest that the downregulation of USP33 in CRC could be partially atributed to heterozygous deletion at the USP33 gene locus (data not shown). The USP33 mRNA expression level has potential value in serving asan independent prognostic factor for CRC.In addition, the protein expression of USP33 and Robol was also examined in a small CRC cohort,and the results showed that USP33 expression was positively correlated with Robol expression,indicating the regulating role ofUSP33 on Robol in clinical CRC tumors.Due to the small case number and weak staining strength of Robol,we did not observed significant downregulation of Robol in CRC and significant effect of Robol on survival (data not shown). Zhou et al. examined the Robol protein using an anti-Robol antibody produced by their lab and reported that high Robol protein expression in CRC associated with tumor metastasis and poor survival. So the exact effect of Robol on survival should be independently validated using commercial anti-Robol antibodies with good specificity and sensitivity in large CRC cohorts in future work.

In summary,our data reveals USP33 as a new player in CRC and Slit-Robo-USP33 as a previous unknown signal transduction pathway in suppressing CRC cell migration. Ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes have been the subjects of intense studies in cancers.Modulators of the enzymes are being evaluated as potential agents in cancer therapy. Future studies are needed to assess the potential value of genes in the Slit-Robo-USP33 pathway in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.
