# ABSTRACT:

Transition metal/nitrogen/carbon (M-N/C) catalysts are considered as one of the most promising candidates to replace Pt/C catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Here, we have designed novel reduced graphene oxides (rGO） supported Fe-N-doped carbon (Fe-N-C/rGO) catalysts via simple pyrolysis of polypyrrole(Ppy)-FeO-GO composites. The as-prepared catalysts induced an onset potential of $0 . 9 4 \mathrm { V }$ , a half-wave potential of $0 . 8 1 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ in alkaline solutions,which is much better than that of the counterpart N-C and N-C/rGO catalysts,and comparable to that of $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalysts. Moreover， the Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts showed improved durability and higher tolerance against methanol crossover than Pt/C in alkaline solutions. This superior ORR perfomance can be ascribed to the combined catalytic effect of both Fe-based nanoparticles ( $\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ ， $\mathrm { F e } _ { 4 } \mathrm { C } )$ ）and $\mathrm { F e - N _ { x } }$ sites,as well as fast mass transfer and accessible active sites benefittng from the mesporous structure and high specific surface area. This work provides new insight for synthesis of a more promising non-platinum electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries and fuel-cell applications.

# INTRODUCTION

The depletion of fossil fuels and deterioration of the natural environment have triggered significant research on sustainable energy storage and conversion systems, such as metal-air bateries and fuel cells.1-3 However, the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode has limited the widespread commercialization of these renewable energy systems.4.5 To date,Pt-based materials are considered as the most efficient electrocatalysts for ORR. Unfortunately, the limited reserve and prohibitive cost of Pt-based materials limit their large-scale application. Moreover, their low durability and poor tolerance to methanol result in the loss of performance. Accordingly， increased eforts are focused on developing nonprecious metal catalysts with low-cost and comparable performance to Pt.6.7

To design effective nonprecious metal catalysts with comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst, two crucial factors need to be considered. First, the intrinsic nature of active sites, which are determined by the catalyst composition. Second, the specific surface area and porous structure，which determine the mass transfer during the reaction process and hence the accessible part of the active sites.8-10 In order to obtain such highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts,various non-precious metal catalysts have been developed, including transition-metal-coordinating macrocyclic compounds,11 pyrolyzed metal/nitrogen/carbon(M-N/C）catalysts,2.13metaloxidesandchalcogenides,1416and heteroatom-doped carbon materials.17,18 Amongst these,the M-N/C(M=Fe, Co, etc.) catalyst system, containing metal-nitrogen coordinating active sites on the surface,are considered one of the most promising catalysts toreplace Pt.19.20

Generally, direct pyrolysis of the precursors which contain carbon, nitrogen and transition metal，like MOFs,21-23 is the most common method used to prepare M-N/C catalysts. However, severe aggregation of products prepared by this method occurs during the pyrolysis process, which results in a sharp decrease of the specific surface area and destruction of the porous structure, thereby impeding mass transfer during the reaction process, and leading to a decline of the ORR activity. To overcome this aggregation, loading the M-N/C catalysts onto graphene or graphene-like two-dimensional nanosheet materials has been employed,which not only increases the specific surface area for a higher catalytic activity, but also retains the porous structure promoting mass transfer.24-27 Therefore, exploring new synthesis strategies for rGO supported M-N/C catalysts is of interest to optimise ORR performance.

Here,we have prepared Fe-N-C/rGO composites with a sheet-like structure by simple pyrolysis of polypyrrole(Ppy)-FeO-GO composites. The as-prepared Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts possessed a mesoporous structure, high specific surface area and many active sites resulting in excellent ORR performance，which is comparable to that of Pt/C catalysts in alkaline media. More importantly, Fe-N-C/rGO show better durability and higher tolerance against methanol crossover than Pt/C in alkaline media, suggesting that it could represent an alternative catalyst material.

# EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

# Chemical reagents and materials

All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Acetone and ammonium persulfate were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (China). The pyrrole monomer was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). Twenty percent Pt/C catalysts were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Deionized water (resistance, $> 1 8 \mathrm { M } \Omega \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ） was used for all experiments work.

# Synthesis of Fe-N-C/rGO electrocatalysts

GO was first synthesized according to a modified Hummers method.28.29 The collidal solution consisted of FeO NPs prepared by a laser ablation in liquid (LAL) method. Scheme 1 shows that an iron plate was fixed in a vessel filled with $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ acetone. The rotating metal plate was ablated for $6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ by a focused laser ( $1 0 6 4 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ with a $1 0 \mathrm { H z }$ pulse repetition rate and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m J } }$ pulse energy. After laser ablation, the fresh colloid was mixed with GO and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dispersed in $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ deionized water to form a uniform colloidal solution. Then $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ pyrrole monomer was added into the colloidal solution and stirred for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Subsequently, $1 1 4 . 1 \mathrm { m g }$ （20 $\mathrm { ( N H _ { 4 } ) _ { 2 } S _ { 2 } O _ { 8 } }$ was added to the above solution with continuous stirring for $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ . The product was collected by centrifugation and dried at $5 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in a vacuum chamber. The final product was heated to $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ under flowing $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ atmosphere with a heating rate of $5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } \operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ . As reference catalyst, N-C/rGO was also synthesized without the addition of the FeO colloid.

# Materialscharacterization

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM） investigations were conducted using a FEI Tecnai TF2O operated at $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k V }$ . High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) imaging and STEM/EDX-mapping was undertaken on a FEI Titan-Themis’ at 300 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were conducted using a field-emission Hitachi SU8020. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Philips X'Pert system with Cu Kα radiation $( \lambda { = } 1 . 5 4 1 9 \mathrm { ~ \AA ~ } )$ . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS） using a Thermo ESCALAB 25O was used to analyse the surface chemical state. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution were estimated by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Tristar 302OM),using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET） and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. Raman spectra were collected using a Renishaw in-Via instrument with an Ar laser source of $5 3 2 \mathrm { n m }$ in a macroscopic configuration.

# Electrochemical Measurements

All the electrochemical measurements were conducted on a Zahner electrochemical workstation (IM6) equipped with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system (ALS, Japan) as part of a three-electrode system; a Pt wire and a KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes,respectively,with the $3 \mathrm { m m }$ diameter RDE coated with the catalyst film serving as the working electrode. Initially the rotating disk electrode was polished with ${ \bf A l } _ { 2 } { \bf O } _ { 3 }$ slurry and ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol for a few minutes. The Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ of the catalyst powder in $3 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ deionized water. Then $5 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of the catalyst ink was deposited onto the polished RDE. After drying the electrode in an ambient environment for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ， $2 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of Nafion solution was dropped onto the dried sample.

The ORR performance of the Fe-N-C/rGO was evaluated in an Ar- and $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ -saturated $0 . 1 \mathbf { M }$ KOH aqueous solution. All the potentials were calibrated to the potentials versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to following equation:

$$
\mathrm { E ( v s . R H E ) } = \mathrm { E ( v s . A g / A g C l ) } + 0 . 1 9 7 + 0 . 0 5 9 \mathrm { p H }
$$

The electron transfer number during the ORR was determined by the Koutechy-Levich equation:

$$
{ \frac { 1 } { \mathrm { J } } } = { \frac { 1 } { \mathrm { J _ { L } } } } + { \frac { 1 } { \mathrm { J _ { K } } } } = { \frac { 1 } { \mathrm { B } \omega ^ { 1 / 2 } } } + { \frac { 1 } { \mathrm { J _ { K } } } }
$$

where $\textbf { J }$ is the measured current density, $\mathrm { J } _ { \mathrm { K } }$ is the kinetic current density, $\mathrm { J _ { L } }$ is the diffusion-limited current density, $\boldsymbol { \omega }$ is the electrode rotation rate and, $\mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ is the Faraday constant $( 9 6 4 8 5 \mathrm { ~ C ~ m o l } ^ { - 1 } )$ ） $\mathrm { C } _ { 0 }$ is the bulk concentration of $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ $\left( 1 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \mathrm { m o l } \mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 } \right.$ for $0 . 1 \textbf { M }$ KOH solution), ${ \bf D } _ { 0 }$ is the diffusion coefficient of $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ $( 1 . 9 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ for 0.1 M KOH solution),and $\nu$ is the kinetic viscosity of the electrolyte $( 0 . 0 1 \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \ \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ for 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution).

# RESULTSANDDISCUSSION

As shown in Scheme 1, laser ablation of an Fe target in acetone was used to produce a yellow Fe-based colloidal solution (inset in Figure S1a). The corresponding XRD pattern (Figure S1a) exhibits difraction peaks which index well to FeO (JCPDF No. O1-1223). Subsequently, the FeO colloidal dispersion was mixed with a GO aqueous dispersion and TEM imaging (Figure S1b) indicated that the FeO was well-dispersed on the GO nanosheets. After that， a uniform polypyrrole shell was coated on the GO nanosheets by oxidative polymerization. The rich oxygen-containing function groups on the GO nanosheets provide active sites for polypyrrole to grow uniformly on GO during polymerization.3° The obtained product exhibited a sheet-like morphology and anchored FeO nanoparticles in Ppy (Figure S2)，which finally underwent a carbonization treatment at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ under ${ \bf N } _ { 2 }$ atmosphere to form the Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst.

SEM imaging of Fe-N-C/rGO (Figure la) revealed sheet-like structures, similar to that of the precursor before carbonization (Figure S2a and b), with no obvious aggregation which would favour a high specific surface area and exposure of active catalytic sites. TEM imaging (Figure 1b-c） showed that Fe-N-C/rGO composite mainly contained sheet-like graphitic carbon and some smal encapsulated nanoparticles. A corresponding HAADF-STEM image (Figure 1d) also revealed that small, high atomic number nanoparticles with an average size of $5 \mathrm { n m }$ were embedded in mesoporous Fe-N-C/rGO.

XRD(Figure S3) of Fe-N-C/rGO showed a broad peak at around $2 5 ^ { \circ }$ confirming the existence of highly graphitized carbon; other diffraction peaks belonged to $\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ (JCPDF No. 89-3854) and $\mathrm { F e _ { 4 } C }$ (JCPDF No. 89-4053). High-resolution TEM images (Figure S4a and b) revealed lattice spacings of $0 . 2 7 { \mathrm { ~ n m } }$ and $0 . 2 2 { \mathrm { ~ n m } }$ which match well with the(11O) and (111) planes of $\mathrm { F e _ { 4 } C }$ . Figure S4c reveals lattice spacings of $0 . 2 9 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and $0 . 2 4 \mathrm { n m }$ coinciding with the（220) and（311） planes of $\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ . As control samples, the N-C and N-C/rGO catalysts were also prepared. As shown in Figure S5a and b,the N-C catalysts carbonized from polypyrrole without rGO displayed an irregular structure with evident aggregation. However, when rGO was introduced into the system, the morphology of N-C/rGO changed into a non-aggregated sheet-like structure (Figure S6a and b). These results indicated that GO nanosheets served as the substrate structure providing nucleation sites for the uniform growth of polypyrrole, and avoiding aggregation of N-C/rGO during the carbonization process. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental maps in Figure 1d revealed that C, N, Fe are uniformly dispersed in the entire sheet-like Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts.

The elemental composition and surface electronic state of Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst was analyzed by XPS. The survey XPS spectrum (Figure S7a) indicated the presence of C (88.1 at. $\%$ )，N (8.16 at. $\%$ )，O (3.68 at $\%$ ）and Fe(0.15at. $\%$ ).As shown in Figure 2a,the high-resolution C 1s spectrum for Fe-N-C/rGO showed four peaks located at $2 8 4 . 6 5 \ \mathrm { e V } .$

285.20 eV, 286.15 eV, and $2 8 8 . 4 3 \ \mathrm { e V }$ ，which can be assigned to C-C, C-N, C-O and $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { C = O } }$ groups,respectively.10.31 Thecorresponding high-resolution N1s spectrum (Figure 2b)could be deconvoluted into four peaks at 398.2, 399.8, 400.9 and $4 0 2 . 5 \ \mathrm { e V }$ ，which are assigned to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N，graphitic-N and oxide-N,respectively.18.32.33 Moreover, the peak located at $3 9 8 . 2 \ \mathrm { e V }$ may also belong to Fe- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf N _ { x } }$ coordination $( { \sim } 3 9 9 . 2 \ \mathrm { ~ e V } )$ ，because the difference between Fe- $\mathbf { \cdot N _ { x } }$ coordination and pyridinic-N (398.2-399 eV） is too small to resolve within the uncertainty of the fit.34 Pyridinic-N and graphitic-N in carbon have been reported to serve as efficient active sites for ORR.35 Here,the amount of graphitic-N and pyridinic-N is $3 1 . 1 \%$ and $3 9 . 3 \%$ which would be expected to enhance the ORR performance. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Fe 2p in Figure S7b reveals two pairs of peaks at 710.5 eV/722.7 eV and 714.2 eV/726.4 eV for $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ ,respectiel the existence of $\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathrm { F e _ { 4 } C }$ in Fe-N-C/rGO.

The degree of graphitization of the catalysts was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Figure S8). Two peaks were observed around $1 3 5 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (D band） and $1 5 8 0 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ (G band). Fe-N-C/rGO has a minimum ratio between the $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ and $\mathbf { G }$ band $\mathrm { ( I _ { D } / I _ { G } ) }$ intensities compared with the N-C and N-C/rGO. This demonstrates that the Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts have a high degree of graphitization. The specific surface areas and mesoporous features of Fe-N-C/rGO and reference catalysts were determined by $\mathbf { N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption-desorption isotherms. The results (Figure 2c,Figure S9, Table S1) indicated that Fe-N-C/rGO and N-C/rGO had a specific surface area of $4 7 7 . 8 1 \ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { g }$ and $4 3 6 . 3 6 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { g }$ ,respectively, both of which were much higher than that of N-C $( 1 0 . 8 4 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { g } )$ . This implies that rGO played a key role in reducing agglomeration and increasing the specific surface area of the catalysts.In addition,all of the catalysts have an appropriate mesopore size distribution of around $3 \ \mathrm { \ n m }$ . Therefore, Fe-N-C/rGO possessed the desired mesoporous structure with a high specific surface areas, favorable for mass transfer during the reaction process and the exposure of active sites.

The ORR performance of Fe-N-C/rGO and reference catalysts were precisely evaluated by detailed electrochemical tests. Firstly，the ORR activity of all catalysts was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry(CV） curves in $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } .$ and $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ -saturated O.1 M KOH. As shown in the CV curves in Figure 3a, obvious cathodic reduction current peaks for all catalysts were observed in the $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ -saturated electrolyte,whilst no cathodic reduction current peak was found in the Ar-saturated electrolyte. The cathodic reduction current peak located at $0 . 7 4 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ versus RHE of Fe-N-C/rGO was much higher than that of N-C/rGO (0.57 V) and N-C (0.56 V), implying that Fe-N-C/rGO had a beter activity than Fe-C/rGO, N-C/rGO and N-C. Subsequently, Linear sweep voltammogram (LSV） curves (Figure 3b) were taken in the $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ -saturated electrolyte to investigate the ORR activity. The N-C catalysts exhibited the worst ORR activity with an onset potential of $0 . 8 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ and a half-wave potential of $0 . 6 1 ~ \mathrm { V }$ ，which is in agreement with the CV results.N-C/rGO catalysts displayed a similar onset potential of 0.80 V and a half-wave potential of 0.65 V. Importantly, when Fe was introduced into the system, Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts possessed the best ORR activity with an onset potential of $0 . 9 4 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ and a half-wave potential of $0 . 8 1 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ ,which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalysts which showed an onset potential of $0 . 9 8 { \mathrm { V } }$ and a half-wave potential of O.82 V (Table S2).

To elucidate the ORR kinetic characteristics and catalytic pathway, the RDE system was used to derive LSV curves (Figure 3c), in which the limiting current density of Fe-N-C/rGO increased with the increasing electrode rotation rates. Corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L)

plots (inset in Figure 3c） taken at different potentials showed nearly linear relationships, which implies first-order reaction kinetics with respect to the concentration of the dissolved oxygen in the solution.14 The transfer electron number (n) calculated from the K-L plots was in the range 3.8-4.0 from $+ 0 . 3 { \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ to $+ 0 . 6 \mathrm { \ : V }$ ，which indicated a direct $4 \mathrm { e } ^ { - }$ ORR process for the Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst. However,the transfer electron numbers of the N-C and N-C/rGO catalysts were estimated to be 2.7 and 2.3,respectively, from the K-L plots in Figure S10 which suggested a poor electron catalytic selectivity. In addition,as shown in Figure 3d, Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts revealed Tafel plot slopes of $9 8 . 8 ~ \mathrm { m V ~ d e c } ^ { - 1 }$ ，which is comparable to that of $\mathrm { P t / C ~ ( 9 3 . 7 ~ m V ~ d e c ^ { - 1 } ) }$ and much lower than that of N-C $( 1 5 7 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m V ~ d e c } ^ { - 1 } )$ and N-C/rGO $( 1 6 0 . 9 ~ \mathrm { m V ~ d e c } ^ { - 1 } ,$ ). These results imply Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts possessed a faster electron transfer rate than their counterparts.

The methanol crossover effect of Fe-N-C/rGO and Pt/C catalysts was evaluated from current versus time (I-t) plots following the injection of methanol into the electrolyte. Figure 4a showed no significant change in current for the Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst after the addition of methanol, unlike Pt/C catalysts which suffered a sharp increase due to the oxidation of methanol. This indicated that Fe-N-C/rGO had a beter tolerance to methanol crossover than Pt/C. The stability of Fe-N-C/rGO and $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalysts was examined by chronoamperometric tests in $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ -saturated 0.1 M KOH. As shown in Figure 4b, Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts displayed an excellent durability with a current loss of only $7 . 2 \%$ decay after 1300O s at a rotation rate of $1 6 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ . In comparison, Pt/C catalysts showed a rapid current loss with $2 0 . 8 \%$ decay under the same conditions.

As has been reported,the presence of Fe species is important in enhancing the ORR activity of the Fe-N-Ccatalysts.9,0,36-38 Here wehave shown that Fe-N-C/rGOcatalysts contain Fe-based nanoparticles and also Fe- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf N _ { x } }$ active sites.However, it is unclear whether the Fe-based nanoparticles formed during the pyrolysis process are the reason for this enhanced activity.39,40 Therefore, we designed two control experiments: firstly,inorder to estimate the contribution of Fe-based nanoparticles to the ORR activity, the Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst was leached in $0 . 5 { \bf \delta M }$ （204 ${ \mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { S O } } _ { 4 }$ at $6 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to remove the Fe-based nanoparticles. TEM and HAADF-STEM images (Figure S11） revealed that most of the Fe-based nanoparticles disappeared after acid leaching. Related LSV curves (Figure 5a) indicated that the acid-leached Fe-N-C/rGO exhibited an $8 0 ~ \mathrm { m V }$ negative shift of the half-wave potential as compared with the original Fe-N-C/rGO material. This result demonstrated that the Fe-based nanoparticles act as active sites playing critical role in catalyzing ORR. Secondly, it is also known that the $\mathsf { S C N } ^ { - }$ ion can poison $\mathrm { F e - N _ { x } }$ active sites and suppress the ORR activity of the catalysts.41.42 Therefore, in a subsequent experiment, the ORR activity of Fe-N-C/rGO was measured in 0.5 M ${ \mathrm { H } } _ { 2 } { \mathrm { S O } } _ { 4 }$ containing O.O1 M KSCN. The half-wave potential of Fe-N-C/rGO decreased significantly by $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m V } }$ after the addition of O.01 M KSCN,as shown in Figure 5b,which implies that the existence of $\mathrm { F e - N _ { x } }$ active sites is important to promote the ORR activity of Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts. Therefore, these two control experiments showed that both the Fe-based nanoparticles and Fe- ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf N _ { x } }$ active sites are necessary to achieve the good ORR catalytic performance.

As described above,Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts possessed an ORR activity comparable to Pt/C with a much better durability and stronger tolerance against methanol crossover, which could be attributed to following reasons: （1） a high percentage of pyridinic-N $( 3 1 . 1 \% )$ and graphitic-N $( 3 9 . 3 \% )$ doped into carbon can reduce the adsorption energy of $\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ because of the N doping-induced charge redistribution;173.44(2)the presence ofFEe impurities whichform Fe- $\mathbf { \cdot N _ { x } }$ coordinate sites and Fe-based nanoparticles embedded in carbon, both of which act as active sites duringORR;10,15345(3）thetwo-dimensional support material,rGO noty improves the exposure of active sites and the stability of catalysts,but also facilitates the charge transfer during the reaction process;26.27 (4) the mesoporous structure and high specific surface area of the catalysts is beneficial to the fast mass transport of reactants.

# CONCLUSIONS

In summary,rGO-supported Fe-N-C(Fe-N-C/rGO) catalysts were fabricated by pyrolysis of a mixture of LAL-induced FeO nanoparticles, GO and PPy. Characterization reveals that the Fe-N-C/rGO catalyst consisted of Fe-N doped carbon with a few Fe-based nanoparticles 号 $\mathrm { ( F e } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ ， $\mathrm { F e } _ { 4 } \mathrm { C } )$ ，and exhibited a high specific surface area and mesoporous structure. Electrochemical tests indicated that Fe-N-C/rGO exhibited a superior ORR activity with an onset potential of $0 . 9 4 \mathrm { \ : V }$ and a half-wave potential of $0 . 8 1 \mathrm { V }$ ，which is comparable to $\mathrm { P t / C }$ in alkaline media. The durability and tolerance against methanol crossover of Fe-N-C/rGO catalysts were much better than that of $\mathrm { P t / C }$ catalysts. Control experiments confirmed that both Fe-based nanoparticles and $\mathrm { F e - N _ { x } }$ active sites can promote the ORR activity of the catalysts. The results of this work may provide a new route for fabrication of M-N/C electrocatalysts with a high-efficiency for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.
