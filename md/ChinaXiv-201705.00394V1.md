Mesoporous ${ \mathsf { C o F e } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres with an average size of $1 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ were fabricated viaa facile hydrothermal process using ethylene glycol as solvent and sodiumacetate (NaAc)as electrostatic stabilizer.In this method,ethylene glycol plays a vital role in the formation of cobalt nanoospheres as a solvent and reducing agent.The structure and morphology of the prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diraction (XRD),scanning electron microscopy (SEM),transmission electron microscopy(TEM),highresolution TEM(HRTEM)，Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR） and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPs).The nanospheres exhibited ferromagnetic properties with high saturation magnetization value of about $6 0 . 1 9 \mathrm { \ e m u / g }$ atroom temperature.The BET surface area of the nanospheres was determined using the nitrogen absorption method. The porous $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres displayed good magnetic properties,which may provide a very promising candidate for their applications in target drug delivery.

# 1．Introduction

Mesoporous materials havea high surface area,uniform and tunable pore sizes,and various morphologies and compositions, which favor their applications in various fields such as catalysis, energy,optics,medicine,electronics and biotechnology[1-5].The cubic spinel structured ferrite $\mathrm { { M F e } _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } }$ ，represents a well-known andimportant class of iron oxide materials.In these materials, oxygen forms a face-centered cubic(fcc) close packing,and the tetrahedral (A)and octahedral (B) sites are occupied by the $\mathsf { F e } ^ { 3 + }$ ions and the divalent metal ions $( \mathbb { M } ^ { 2 + } )$ ,respectively. Among the spinel ferrites,cobalt ferrite $\mathrm { ( C o F e _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } ) }$ ,awell-known hard magneticmaterial,has been extensively studied because of its interesting magnetic properties.The moderate saturation magnetization,large magneto-crystalline anisotropy,high coercivity,chemical stabilityand mechanical hardnessmake the cobalt ferriteas oneof the competitive candidates for high-density magnetic recording media [6,7].Therefore research on development of fabrication methods for ferrite nanoparticles with desirable magnetic property,acceptable chemical stability and surface chemistry that allow attracting interest of several research groups for straight forward functionalization with different surface active motives.

Recently,solvothermal method has been successfully used to fabricate $\mathrm { M g F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ ， $\mathrm { M n F e } _ { 2 } { \sf O } _ { 4 }$ and $\mathrm { N i F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ nano/microspheres [8-10]. For high performancein function-specific biological applications,magnetic particles must be spherical with smooth surfaces,narrow size distributions,large surface areas,high magnetic saturation to provide maximum signal,and good dispersion in liquid media [11-13]. Owing to the great application potentialsincatalysis,adsorption，separation，mesoporous magnetic nanospheres have been of keen interest recently. Herein, theaim of the present work was undertaken to report in details thehydrothermal synthesis, characterization,and magnetic properties of mesoporous spinel $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres.

# 2.Experimental procedure

All chemicals were of analytic grade and used as received without further purification. The mesoporous ferrite nanospheres were prepared via a hydrothermal reaction in ethylene glycol.Ina typical experiment, $2 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m m o l }$ ${ \mathsf { C o C l } } _ { 2 } \cdot 6 { \mathsf { H } } _ { 2 } 0$ and 5 mmol $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 } \cdot 6 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } 0$ were dissolved in $4 0 . 0 \mathrm { m L }$ ethylene glycol $\mathrm { ( H O C H _ { 2 } C H _ { 2 } O H ) }$ ） $3 . 6 \ : \mathrm { g }$ of sodium acetate trihydrate $\mathrm { ( C H _ { 3 } C O O N a \cdot 3 H _ { 2 } O ) }$ and $_ { 2 \mathrm { g } }$ of polyethylene glycol (PEG-4ooo) was added under magnetic stirring.This mixture was then vigorouslystirredat $5 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ to form a homogeneous solution. The transparent solution was then transferred into an autoclave,which was then tightly sealed and hydrothermally treated at $1 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for $1 6 \mathrm { h }$ inan oven. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature.The black product obtained was washed several times in excess waterand dried at $6 0 ^ { \circ } C$ for $^ { 6 \mathrm { h } }$ before characterization and application.The schematic diagram for hydrothermal synthesis of nanospheres is illustrated in Fig. 1.

The crystal structure of the synthesized powder was identified by a Bruker D2 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation $\langle \lambda = 0 . 1 5 4 0 5 \mathrm { n m } \rangle$ in the range of $2 0 { - } 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ with step mode of $0 . 2 / \mathrm { m i n }$ ，Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed with a Hitachi S-4800 microscope coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM） characterizations were carried out on a Philips Tecnai F2O instrument working at $1 5 0 \mathrm { k V } .$ Magnetization measurements of the samples were carried out using a physical properties measurement system at room temperature.FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer V755 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer at wavenumbers $4 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ using KBr pellets.The surface area and the pore size were studied by nitrogensorption measurements which were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2o2O gas sorptometer. Information about the oxidation states of these samples was obtained from X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) using Kratos Analytical Axis Ultra DLD with Al $\mathrm { K } \alpha _ { 1 }$ source.

# 3.Results anddiscussion

After the precursor solution was heated at $1 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for $1 6 \mathrm { h }$ ,the black powders were collected by a magnet.The structure and phase purity of the nanospheres were confirmed by X-ray diffraction patternsand is presented in Fig.2.It can be seen that the diffraction peaks match well with the standard pattern of cubic $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ with a spinel structure (JCPDS no.22-1086).The peaks observedat $3 0 . 4 ^ { \circ } , 3 5 . 7 ^ { \circ } , 3 7 . 3 ^ { \circ } , 4 3 . 4 ^ { \circ } , 5 3 . 8 ^ { \circ } , 5 7 . 3 ^ { \circ } , 6 2 . 7 ^ { \circ }$ and $7 4 . 7 ^ { \circ } 2 \theta$ can be assigned to (220),(311),(222),(400),(422),(511),(440) and (533）planes of spinel ${ \mathsf { C o F e } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 4 }$ ，respectively. The interesting observation is that broad peaks in Co ferrite indicate fine nanocrystalline nature of samples.The average crystal size of the mesoporous $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres calculated from the Scherrer equation was about $1 4 . 9 \mathrm { n m }$

To analyze the nanoscale structure,both transmission and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (TEM/FESEM） were used.Fig.3 shows SEM and TEM micrographs of mesoporous $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres.The typical low and high magnification FESEM images of $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ are shown in Fig.3(a) and (b). The SEM image of sample shows that the diameters of most of the spheres are in the range of $1 2 0 { - } 2 8 0 \mathrm { m }$ .While,the TEM image(Fig.3c) of sample shows that the diameters of most of the spheres are in the range of $9 0 - 1 8 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ .It can be seen the particle size distribution of nanoparticles on the surface of a sphere and the primary particle size is tens of nanometers.Fig.3d shows the HRTEM image on the edge of a sphere,indicating the interplanar spacing of the parallel fringeswas $0 . 2 6 6 \mathrm { n m }$ at (22O),which is in good agreement with the（220）plane of the spinel $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ .The EDX spectrum of $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ shown in Fig.3e demonstrates the presence of Co,Fe,and O with an approximate atomic ratio of 1:2:4,which is consistent with $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ .The percentage of Co/Fe values obtained is given in the inset of Fig. 3e.

The porous oriented ferrite nanospheres have shown good magnetic property. Fig. 4(a) presents the corresponding magnetization asa function ofapplied magnetic field,or the $M$ versus $H$ curve.The saturation magnetization $\left( M _ { s } \right)$ and the coercivity $\left( H _ { \mathrm { c } } \right)$ of the cobalt ferrite nanospheres are about $6 0 . 1 9 \mathrm { \ e m u / g }$ and 136 Oe, which are lowerto the values of bulk ${ \mathsf { C o F e } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 4 }$ 1 ${ \mathrm { \ s 0 \ e m u / g } }$ and 150 Oe,respectively）[14].The reduction in saturation magnetization may be attributed to the surface disorder or spin canting at the particles surface[15].The center part of the Fig.4a is enlarged and is shown in Fig.4b.Keen observation of the Fig.4b illustrates the ferromagnetic behavior of the powders.

The organic bonds present in mesoporous were characterized using the FTIR spectrum.Fig.4c shows the FT-IR spectra of the $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres recorded between 4ooo and $4 0 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ . The absorption band $( \upsilon _ { 1 } )$ around $6 0 0 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { - 1 }$ is attributed to stretching vibrations of tetrahedral complexes and band $( \upsilon _ { 2 } )$ around $4 0 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ to that of octahedral complexes [16,17]. The broad peak observed at $\sim 3 4 3 8 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ is assigned to the stretching vibration of surface hydroxyls absorbed on surface and O-H groups in absorbed water,which indicates the presence of adsorbed moisture.The appearance of $2 9 3 5 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ waveband is assigned to the stretching of ether groups and the characteristics absorption of alkyl $\left( \mathbb { R } \mathrm { - } \mathbf { C } \mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \right)$ stretching modes.The peak observed at $1 6 3 9 \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ is assigned to H-O-H bending vibration in water molecular.The weak peak at $1 0 6 2 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ is assigned to the $\scriptstyle { C = 0 }$ stretching.

Nitrogen adsorption-desorption studies on as-prepared mesoporous $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 4 }$ showed a type IV isotherm with an inflection of nitrogen adsorbed volume at $P / P _ { 0 }$ about 0.5（Fig.4d) which confirmed the formation of mesoporous with a wormlike pore structure connected by tiny holes in the ferrite clusters.The specific surface area,calculated from the linear region of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller(BET） plot,was $8 5 . 4 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ . The poresize distribution spectrum as shown in the inset of Fig.4d,obtained by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method,clearly illustrated the presence of mesopores,which were mainly located in the narrowrange of $5 { - } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ,and peakedat ${ 9 \mathrm { n m } }$ In connection with the TEM image presented in Fig.3c,such poreswere (the enlarged edge of the microsphere） formed mainly from the stacking of nanoparticles.

The chemical composition of mesoporous ${ \mathsf { C o F e } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres Was further investigated by XPS.From Fig.5a it can be clearly noticed that the peaks of Co,Fe,O and C exist.The C element (Fig.5a） may originate from the adventitious carbon-based contaminant and/or from the organic compounds such as residual ethylene glycol and PEG adsorbed on the surface.The binding energy of the C 1s peak at $2 8 4 . 8 \mathrm { e V }$ is used as the reference for calibration.The peaks appearing at 777.3 and $7 9 2 . 5 \mathrm { e V }$ correspond to the Co $2 \mathrm { p } _ { 3 / 2 }$ and Co $2 \mathsf { p } _ { 1 / 2 }$ states (Fig.5b),indicating the presence of ${ \mathsf { C o } } ^ { 2 + }$ [18].Fig.5c shows the Fe 2p spectrum. The Fe 2p shows two peaks at 708.96 and $7 2 2 . 5 \mathrm { e V }$ which is consistent with Fe 2p binding energy for cobalt ferrite nanoparticles [19]. The peak located at $5 2 8 . 5 \mathrm { e V }$ is attributed to the O 1s region [20],as shown in Fig. 5d.

In addition to the normal applications,such as constructing nanoscale magnetic devices and high-density storage media [21- 23],the obtained porous magnetic micro/nanoospheres exhibits high specific surface areas and strong magnetic properties which could be used as an effective adsorbent for removal of some toxic chemicals.Generally, these chemicals are difficult to remove and arealso important in environment remediation.

# 4.Conclusions

In this study,mesoporous ${ \mathsf { C o F e } } _ { 2 } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 4 }$ nanospheres were prepared usinga facile hydrothermal technique.The developed approach is simple and efficient route to fabricate cobalt ferrite nanospheres witha tunable diameter range of $1 2 0 \mathrm { - } 1 8 0 \mathrm { n m }$ Information from the XRD pattern and FTIR spectrum of the mesoporous $\mathrm { C o F e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ confirmed well with each other. EDX pattern confirmed the phase purity.As observed in XPS,cobalt was found to be in the $2 ^ { + }$ oxidation state and iron was found to be in the ${ 3 ^ { + } }$ oxidation state on the surface in cobalt ferrite sample,respectively.These cobalt ferrite porous microspheres have excellent magnetic properties and high surface area.The maximum saturation magnetization value of the product is $6 0 . 1 9 \mathrm { \ e m u / g }$ ，The prepared products will have potential applications in many fields such as catalysis,lithium ion batteries and drug delivery,etc.This method provided a more convenient,one-step and economic way for scalable production of metal nanospheres.
