While in UPVC, change in $_ { o - \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity is hardly observable in all the above-mentioned three measurements.

In polymer, $p$ Ps undergoes self-annihilation (positron in $p$ Ps anihilates with itsown partner electron)withalifetimeof125ps,justlikeinvacuum.However,during its lifetime 1 a free volume $o$   
arameters of $o$ Ps are directly related to the characteristics offree volume.For a long time,it was commonly accepted that $o$ -Ps lifetime depended on the size of free volume (Tao,1972),and $o$ Ps intensity was the $o$

Positrons emitted from the $^ { 2 2 } \mathrm { { N a } }$ positron source with the average energy of approximately $2 2 0 \mathrm { k e V } ,$ can easily induce free radicals in polymers. Free radicals have a strong affinity to electrons and act oositron spur.

In contrast, $\scriptstyle { o }$ Ps intensity can be inhibited by both gamma irradiation and positron irradiation. After $9 8 ~ \mathrm { { h ^ { \prime } } }$ measurement, the $o$ Ps intensity in non-irradiated LDPE is lowered from the initial value of $2 4 . 5 \%$ to about $\textcircled { 2 3 \% }$ , with a decreasement of $6 \%$ . The decreasement of $o$ Ps intensity is fastinthe first $3 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,thereafterthe decreasement becomes very slow.It seems thatthe $o$ Ps intensity has reached its saturationvalue. Interestingly, $o$ Ps intensity n LDPE1000 and UPVC shows similar behaviour. There are no observable changes in $\alpha$ Ps intensity, which keepsaround $1 5 . 6 \%$ in LDPE1000 and $4 . 3 \%$ in UPVC.

Qi et al., 2015),freeradicals in PMMA are not stable at RT which results in the absence of decrease in $o$ -Ps intensity with elapsed time. However, when the temperature fals to $2 2 5 \mathrm { \ K } ,$ there is a significant decline in $o$ -Ps intensity with MMA.Further analysis willbe conducted in combination with results at low temperature.

3.2 positronPositron irradiation effect on positronium formation at low temperature

At low temperature $\scriptstyle ( \mathrm { T } = 1 0 \ \mathrm { K } )$ ,the behaviour of $o$ Ps intensity with time is very different from that at RT.As shown in Fig.6,the $_ { o \mathrm { - } \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity of non-irradiated LDPE increases from $1 8 \%$ to about $3 0 \%$ ，with an increasement of $67 \%$ during $5 0 ~ \mathrm { h } ^ { \prime }$ irradiation in darkness. $o$ Ps intensity increases rapidly within initial $4 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ and later tends to saturate. From $^ { 5 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to 68h,PALS measurement paused, instead, CDB measurement was carried out. After $1 6 ~ \mathrm { { h ^ { \prime } } }$ CDB neasurement,it is found that $o$ Ps intensity in LDPE isstill around $3 0 \%$ ，confirming $_ { o - \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity has reached its saturation value.Next,when green light is applied, $o$ Ps intensity sharply decreases down to $1 9 \%$ in two hours.After Jreen light isapplied for $^ { 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ $\scriptstyle { o }$ Ps intensity reduces to $1 6 \%$ and thereafter remains nearly unchanged. After $1 2 ~ \mathrm { h ^ { \prime } }$ measurement under greenlight,PALS measurement paused,instead, CDB measurement was carried out.After the CDB neasurement,it is found that $_ { o - \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity in LDPE is still around $1 6 \%$ ，confirming $o$ Ps intensity has reached its saturation value.Note that the saturation value of $\scriptstyle o - \mathrm { P s }$ intensity under light is lower than the initial value in darkness at $1 0 ~ \mathrm { K } ,$ indicatingatsifdobaiofidadtroarinsttousodl $_ { o - \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity in dark should be $1 6 \%$ instead of $1 8 \%$ .

Fig.8 shows positron irradiation effects at $1 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ in gamma-irradiated LDPE samples,LDPE200 and LDPE2000.In both samples,after $5 0 ~ \mathrm { h ^ { \prime } }$ measurement in darkness, $o$ Ps intensity shows no obvious changes.However, when green light is applied, $_ { o - \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity decreases.For LDPE200, $_ { o - \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity decreases from the value in darkness 15.5-to $1 4 \%$ .For LDPE2000, $o$ Ps intensity decreases from the value in darkness 14.3-to $1 3 \%$ .Since light bleaching effect is the unique characteristic of positronium formed bya positron and a trapped electron,the reduction of $_ { o - \mathrm { P s } }$ intensity by light indicates the existenceof the special positronium formation mechanism at low temperature in prolonged measurement time.

To further confirm the speciality of positro $o$ $5 0 ~ \mathrm { K } { - } 2 9 3 ~ \mathrm { K } { - } 5 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ given in Fig. 11, in comparison with le result of LDPE ( $1 0 ~ \mathrm { K } { - } 2 9 3 ~ \mathrm { K } { - } 1 0 ~ \mathrm { K } )$ in Fig.10. The changes of $o$ Ps lifetime ipanied by the rearrangement of polymer chains. Since the sarrangement of polymer chains in the proce $o$ ifet with that in cooling process.The behaviour of $o$ Ps fetime is the similar in LDPE and UPVC. Below we will only focus on the variation of $o$ Ps intensity. For non-polar polymer LDPE, $o$ Ps intensity increases slowly during the elevation of temperature from $1 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ 0 $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { K } ,$ it decreases to ome extent at $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ and reaches to a relatively high value at room temperature.In cooling process, $o$ Ps intensity decreases from RT to $2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { K } ,$ thereafter, it begins to increase significantly, finally gets the value of $3 0 \%$ at $1 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ iterestingly, the value of $o$ -Ps intensity aftera thermal circle is nearly the $5 2 ~ \mathrm { h ^ { \prime } }$ measurement in darkness at $1 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ (Fig. 6). It takes about $3 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to finish the thermal circle,temperature effect is accompanied with time fect. Shallow trapped electrons accumulate with time,thus $o$ Ps intensities between $1 5 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ and $1 0 ~ \mathrm { K }$ in coling process are much higher than thatin heating process While in UPVc,the value of $o$ Ps intensity in cooling process and in ti

# Conclusion

Teft $\scriptstyle { o }$ Ps intensity decreases witl me at room temperature and increases with time in darkness at low temperature,light can result in sharply decrease of $o$ Ps intensity. In addition,in a thermal circle $1 0 ~ \mathrm { K } { - } 2 9 3 ~ \mathrm { K } { - } 1 0 ~ \mathrm { K } ,$ （ $o$ Ps intensity increases ignificantly incooling processelow $1 5 0 \mathrm { K }$ While in heavilygamma-irrdiated LDPE and UPVC, neither the decreaseof $o$ Ps intensity with timeatroom temperature northe increase of $o$ Ps intensity with time ir arkness at low temperature appears. $_ { o \mathrm { - } \mathrm { P s } }$ inteit he former, application oflight leads to the decrease of $o$ Ps intensity, in contrast to the absence of changes in $o$ Ps intensity in the latter. The appearance of light bleaching effect suggests that the special positronium tioetpstvdfitictf $o$ Ps intensity in cooling process and in heating process adicals.It is likely that in gamma iradiated LDPE,free radicals are not stable at RT, just like in PMMA.
