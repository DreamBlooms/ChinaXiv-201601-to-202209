# Summary

Plant engineered to express double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can target the herbivorous insect gene for silencing.Although mounting evidence has emerged to support feasibility of this new pest control technology,field application is slow largely due to lack of potent targets. Here,we show that suppresson of the gene encoding NDUFV2,a subunit of mitochondrial complex Ithat catalyses NADH dehydrogenation in respiratory chain,was highly lethal to insects.Feeding cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) larvae with transgenic cotton tissues expressing NDUFV2 dsRNA led to mortality up to $80 \%$ within 5 days,and almost no larvae survived after 7 days of feeding,due to the altered mitochondrial structure and activity.Transcriptome comparisons showed a drastic repression of dopa decarboxylase genes. Reciprocal assays with Asian corn borer(Ostrinia furnacalis),another lepidopteran species,revealed the sequence-specific effect of NDUFV2 suppression.Furthermore,the hemipteran lugus Apolygus lucorum was also liable to NDUFV2 represson.These data demonstrate that the mitochondrial complex Iis a promising target with both sequence specificity and wide applicability for the development of newgeneration insect-proof crops.

# Introduction

Insect pests cause enormous yield loss in crop production. Although chemical insecticides have brought great benefits to feed our growing population and support global economic sectors (Mascarelli，2013;Stokstad，2013;Verger and Boobis, 2013),there are increasing concerns on multiple environmental and human health problems (Heckel，2012；Mascarelli，2013; Stokstad，2013； Ziska and McConnell，2015)． In the past 20 years，genetically engineered crops producing insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt),mostly transgenic cotton, corn and canola,have contributed more and more to reducing insecticide usageand increasing yield and farmer profits (Carriere et al.,2015;Tabashnik et al.,2013);however, the limited scope of Bt susceptible insects and the rapid development of resistance call for new technologies of pest control (Carriere et al.,2015;Jin et al.,2015a;Tabashnik et al.,2013).

Plant-mediated RNA interference (PM-RNAi) engineers plant to express double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting to herbivorous the insect gene and suppress its expression after ingestion (Baum et al.，2007；Mao et al.，2007). It holds great promise for breeding the next-generation insect-proof crops due to the sequence-specific preciseness and selectivity (Price and Gatehouse，2oo8)．Till now，this technology has been confirmed applicable to a wide range of chewing and piercing-sucking insects,including cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera),westerncorn rootworm (Diabroticavirgifera virgifera LeConte), Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata)and the

English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) (Abdellatef etal.，2015; Baum et al.,2007;Mao et al.,2007,2011;Zhang et al.,2015). Ourprevious report showed that the RNAi effect could be enhanced by co-expressing cysteine protease to increase the permeability of insect midgut peritrophic matrix(Mao et al., 2013).More recently,an important progress has been made in engineering plastids to express high dosage of the dsRNA (Jin et al.,2015b; Zhang et al.,2015).However,most genes examined so far show moderate inhibitive effects on insect growth and development,and highly potent targets are in urgent demand for either nucleic or plastid dsRNA expression.

Mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is one of the largest membrane-bound protein assemblies with 14 central and up to 32 accessory subunits,containing flavine mononucleotide and iron-sulphur clusters as redox prosthetic groups (Brandt,2006;Hirst, 2013). It pumps protons across the inner membrane of mitochondria and generates proton gradient to drive ATP production (Brandt，2oo6)，and is also an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) (Sena and Chandel，2012).Dysfunctions of human complex I subunits may lead to imbalance of NADH/NAD+ ratios and ROS production (Kussmaul and Hirst，2oo6)，causing Leigh's syndrome，mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (Benit et al.，2003;Koene et al., 2012).

Here，we report that suppression of NDUFV2,which encodes the $2 4 - k \Delta$ subunit of mitochondrial complex I，was lethal to lepidopteran and hemipteran insects,and the effect was species specific.Thus,NDUFV2 can serve asa promising target for further development of PM-RNAi for precise insect pest control.

# Results and Discussion

# Identification of NDUFV2 as a target gene for PM-RNAi

We employed cotton bollworm (H.armigera)，a lepidopteran generalist insect and one of the most devastating agriculture pests,to screen for effective PM-RNAi target genes that can quickly control larval growth or induce high mortality.Based on our previous assembly and annotation of H.armigera EST data set (Tao et al.，2012),50 genes involved in metabolism,energy production and hormone signalling were selected，and their corresponding dsRNAs were expressed in Arabidopsisplants under the control of CaMV35S promoter.Rosette leaves from two to five homozygous transgenic lines with high dsRNA levels were used to feed the 2nd-instar larvae.

Of these，HaNDUFV2，encoding the subunit NDUFV2 of the mitochondria complexI (NADH:ubiquinoneoxidoreductase), exhibited a high activity in inhibiting larval growth.The open reading frame (ORF) of HaNDUFV2 is 738 bp long, from which a 364-bp fragment (197-560 bp)was expressed for dsRNA production in transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Figure 1a,b).After feeding with the35S::dsHaNV2 leaves for5 days,larvae exhibited severely retarded growth as revealed by $4 0 \mathrm { - } 6 0 \%$ less weight compared with the control groups,which were administrated With leaves taken from nontransgenic (wild-type,WT) or transgenic plants harbouring other dsRNA constructs (Figure 1c and Figure S1 a,b).The growth inhibition became observable within 2daysof the feeding,and progressively severeralongwith the assay time (Figure S1 b).After 14 days of feeding，mortalities ranged from 55 to $9 5 \%$ in tested groups,in comparison with $5 - 1 0 \%$ mortality of those fed with WT plants(Figure 1d).Pupation oflarvae was observed after continuous feeding ofWTplantsfor25- 30 days (Figure 1e,Table S1).For those fed with transgenic plants, however,mostof the larvae died before pupation.When the limited survivals were able to pupate, no eclosion was observed (Figure 1e, Table S1).Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of HaNDUFV2 in midgut was clearly suppressed by the 35S::dsHaNV2 leaves (Figure 1f).

Tofurther examine the effect of plant-mediated HaNDUFV2 suppression,we selected another fragment of this gene,HaNV2 $( 2 )$ (501-755 bp),to generate dsRNA in Arabidopsis (Figure 1a). Similar inhibition on larval growth and HaNDUFV2 gene expression was observed (Figure 1g,h),and feeding of 35S:dsHaNV2(2)

transgenic plants for 2 weeks also led to mortality up to $70 \%$ (Figure 1i). After completion of the feeding $( \sim 3 0$ days), the pupae numbers of the test groups were greatly reduced compared with the control (Figure 1j).These data demonstrate that HaNDUFV2 is a potent gene for effective PM-RNAi against cotton bollworm.

# 35S:HaNDUFV2 cotton plants are resistant to bollworm larval damage

Wenext asked whether the PM-RNAi towards NDUFV2 was also or even more effective in the preferred host plant of the target insect.The 35S::dsHaNV2 construct was introduced into cotton (G.hirsutum cv.R15),and the transgenic lines with high dsRNA expressions were selected (Figure 2a，Figure S2).Strikingly, compared with Arabidopsis, the transgenic cotton plants showed a much stronger effect on larval growth and mortality,with only 5 days required to achieve lethality of $5 0 \mathrm { - } 8 0 \%$ in test populations,and after 7 days,almost no larvae survived from the 35S:: dsHaNV2 cotton leaves (Figure 2b,Figure S3 a).Survivalsat day 5 exhibited little growth and were 4-5 times smaller than those fed with nontransgenic cotton leaves (Figure S3 b). Consistent with larval growth inhibition,the HaNDUFV2expression in midgutwas markedly suppressed by the transgenic cotton leaf (Figure 2c). Furthermore,this insect resistance trait was stably transmitted to progenies,at least to the ${ \sf T } _ { 3 }$ generation we have obtained so far.

The protection of cotton leaves and cotton bolls (fruits) from bollworms was then examined.The 3rd-instar larvae were placed on leaves,and after 3 days,almost all leaf tissues of the wild type were ingested,whereas larvae preceded less damage on the 35S:: dsHaNV2 transgenic cotton leaves (Figure 2d).In contrast to the well growth of larvae raised on nontransgenic cotton leaves, those on 35S::dsHaNV2 showed extremely slow growth and $4 0 \mathrm { - } 5 0 \%$ mortality (Figure 2d).When the 15-DPA cotton bolls were given to the larvae，most larvae drilled into the wild-type bolls from top and ate the majority of ovules after 7 days. However, less damage was observed on the 35S::dsHaNV2 cotton bolls,and most larvae ingested only limited epidermal tissues of the pericarp，causing little or no damage to ovules,and their growth was slow or ceased (Figure 2d).These results demonstrate that the 35S::dsHaNV2 cotton plants were highly resistant to cotton bollworm.

fattybodyand ovary,with the highest transcript abundance in epidermis (Figure 3a),and the expression level did not change significantly throughout the development stages examined, except for a particularly high level at 6th instar (Figure 3b).

To gain insight into the mechanism of insect death triggered by HaNDUFV2 suppression,we analysed the larvae after 2 days of feeding assay when the growth inhibition started to be evident. Western blot showed that the HaNDUFV2 protein level was reduced in midgut of the larvae that ingested 35S:dsHaNV2 cotton leaves (Figure 3c)，which led to decreased complex I activity (Figure 3d).Furthermore，transmission electron microscopic examination of intestinal wall hair cells revealed abnormal morphological structuresafter HaNDUFV2 suppression:while the mitochondria in larvae of the control group were elongated and regularly spaced，and the cristae were flattened，those of the HaNDUFV2-suppressed larvae were round with swollen and irregular cristae (Figure 3e).These data highlight the importance of maintaining a critical level of HaNDUFV2 in mitochondrial development and function， and the fatal consequenceof NDUFV2 repression.

Mitochondria is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) (Hirst,2013).The NDUFV2 subunit is involved in controlling ROS generation，and loss of NDUFV2 function led to increased ROSs (Sazanov and Hinchliffe，2oo6； Sing et al., 2014).We found that suppression of HaNDUFV2 expression led to increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities (Figure 4a) and glutathione (reduced，GSH) contents (Figure 4b)，whichare important antioxidants in animal cells.Although this led to the increased amount of total antioxidant molecules (Figure 4c),the content of malondialdehyde (MDA),a resultant product of lipid peroxidation and degradation by oxidative damage,still increased (Figure 4d),indicating severe oxidative damage in cells.Moreover,the NAD+/NADH ratio,which reflects the balance between oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide，decreased significantly in midgut of those fed on transgenic plants (Figure 4e).As $\mathsf { N A D } ^ { + }$ and NADH play an important role in transcriptional regulation,longevity and ageassociated diseases，and the NAD+/NADH ratio indicates redox status and metabolism activity in cells and isan important controlling factor of the activity of several key enzymes,including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (Lin and Guarente,2oo3;Sun et al.，2012),decrease in this ratio should cause an changed status of cell metabolism and energy production.Furthermore，the activities of total ATPases/GTPases，which play a key role in energy production and signal transduction,were decreased (Figure 4e).

To gain a global view of the gene expression changes caused by HaNDUFV2 suppression，midgut transcriptomes of the bollWorms fed with WT or 35S::dsHaNV2 cotton leaves for 2 days were generated by RNA-seq and compared.Assembly of all reads resulted in 32 019 unigenes， of which 26 700 could be functionally annotated.Totally，11 O37 differentially expressed genes $( \| \mathsf { o g } _ { 2 } \mathsf { R a t i o } \| > 1 ) ,$ ）were detected,of which 3066 were upand 7971 down-regulated in the transgenic cotton treated larvae (Table S2).Although this short period feeding reduced the HaNDUFV2 transcript byonlyabout $3 6 \%$ ,altered expressions of genesrelated to respiratory chain，energy productionand metabolite transportation were observed (Table S3)，which is consistent with the disruption of mitochondrial structure and function. Interestingly， genesencodingdopa decarboxylase (DDC),which catalyses the production of neural transmitters of dopamine and serotonin and playsa role in insect behaviour, parasite defence and cuticle hardening (Hodgetts and O'Keefe, 2006)，were down-regulated significantly in the larvae treated with dsHaNV2-expressing Arabidopsis and cotton (Figure 4f,g, Table S4)，implying less dopamine production and decreased neural activities.These results suggest that suppressed NDUFV2 expression and reduced complex I activities after ingestion of 35S::dsHaNV2 plants led to mitochondria dysfunctions,causing insufficient energy supplement, increased oxidative stress in cells and possibly reduced neural activities due to decreased dopamine production,which,finally,resulted in larvae death.

# Lethal effect by NDUFV2 suppression is independent of phytoalexins in cotton

Cotton plants accumulate a high concentration of cadinene-type sesquiterpenoids (e.g. gossypol and hemigossypolone) in epidermal pigmented glandsof aerial organsand epidermal/subepidermal layers of root，which function as phytoalexins against herbivores and pathogens (Luo et al.，2oo1；Ma et al.，2016; Tan et al.，200O;Yang et al.，2013). Previously，we used the bollworm P450 gene CYP6AE14 to develop PM-RNAi (Mao et al., 2007).As it relies on the presence of gossypol in diet,this is most effective on herbivores living on cotton plants.To find out whether the lethal effect of NDUFV2 repression was also enhanced by gossypol,we employed tobacco rattle virus (TRV) to produce dsRNAs in glanded (gossypol-containing) and glandless (gossypol-free) cotton leaves by integrating the target dsRNA fragment into the virus genome,in a manner similar to virusinduced gene silencing (ViGS) (Kumar et al.，2012). Feeding of H.armigera larvae with TRV:dsHaNV2-infected glanded cotton leaves for5 daysresultedinasimilaradverseeffect on larvae survival rate and growth as that observed with stably transformed plants (Figure S4 a,b and c),and a prolonged feeding led to all death of the tested populations，suggesting that this virusmediated dsRNA expression in plants mimicked the stable transgenic plants. Importantly， the glanded and the glandless cottons infected with TRV:dsHaNV2 did not show statistically significantdifference on larvaesurvival andgrowthrates (Figure S4 a,b)，suggesting that insect control by NDUFV2 suppression is independent of gossypol andpossibly other defensive metabolites either,and could be applied to other crops.

# PM-RNAi of NDUFV2 is sequence specific and effective to other insect pests

Wenext tested the specificity of NDUFV2 suppression by PMRNAi，which is of particular importance as complex I isa conserved component in respiratory chain of eukaryotes (Brandt, 2006;Hirst,2013).The Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis)is another lepidopteran insect,and itsNDUFV2(OfNDUFV2) shares nucleotide sequence identity of $7 9 \%$ with HaNDUFV2 (Figure S5). A homologous fragment from OfNDUFV2,which shares nucleotide identity of $80 \%$ with that used for HaNDUFV2 RNAi (Figure S5)，was used to generate the TRV:dsOfNV2 construct. Tobacco(Nicotianabenthamiana） leavesexpressingeither dsRNAs were used to feed cotton bollworms or Asian corn borers for 5 days.We found that,after ingesting leaves expressing their own dsNDUFV2，both $H .$ armigeraand O.furnacalis showed high mortality of about $70 \%$ (Figure 5a,d)and significantly reduced weight of the survivals (Figure 5b,e).Consistently, NDUFV2 expression levels in midgut of each species were decreased(Figure 5c,f).However，when exchanged， thatis feeding H.armigerawith TRV:dsOfNV2 leavesand O.furnacalis withTRV:dsHaNV2 leaves，neither insect showed a significant difference in mortality and weight increase from the control group，nor the change in expression levels of the respective NDUFV2 gene (Figure 5a-f).These results indicate that NDUFV2 can be extended to other lepidopteran chewing insects,and, importantly，without observable cross-activities，at least at the level of $80 \%$ nucleotide sequence identity.

Lygus (Apolygus lucorum),a species of the Miridae family,has become an increasingly devastating insect pest in field in recent years,correlating to the wide cultivation of Bt crops and thus the reduced insecticide usage (Lu et al.,2010,2012).They puncture plant tissues with piercing-sucking mouthparts and feedby sucking sap,in contrast to chewing insects of cotton bollworm and corn borer.Placing A. Iucorum on TRV:AlNV2-infected cotton plants for7 days also resulted in the decrease in nymph numbers (or increased mortality) and retarded growth,compared with the group on the control (empty vector) plants (Figure 6a-c).And similarly,no growth inhibitory effect was detected in the group fed with TRV:dsHaNV2 cotton plants.These results suggest that PMRNAi against NDUFV2 is also effective in controling lygus.

# Genes of other subunits of complex l can also be effective in PM-RNAi

To find out whether other subunits of complex l could be used as PM-RNAi targets，we searched H.armigera EST data set and identified the nuclear genes encoding subunits of NDUFV1, NDUFS1，NDUFS2，NDUFS3，NDUFS7，NDUFS8 and NDUFAF1, and the mitochondrial genes encoding subunits of ND1,ND4 and ND5.Feeding assays with TRV-mediated dsRNA expressing cotton plantsand transgenicArabidopsis plantsrevealed that,although HaNDUFV2 appeared to be the most potent，HaNDUFS1 and HaNDUFS8 were also highly active in inducing mortality and larval growth retardation (Figure 7a,b).

Dysfunctions of mitochondrial complex I subunits have been reported to be correlated to the imbalance of NADH/NAD $^ +$ ratio and ROS production (Kussmaul and Hirst,2oo6),causing lactic acidosisandneurologicaldisorderslikemitochondrial encephalomyopathy (Benit et al.，20o3； Koene et al.，2012). We found that the suppression of NDUFV2 by PM-RNAi,which led to the disruption of mitochondrial structures and cellular functions in insect midgut,can be used as a highly effective and specific approach for insect pest control.We demonstrate that more than lepidopterans which can be controlled by Bt toxins, the Bt-insensitive insect pests,such as the lygus of hemipteran,are also susceptible to plant-mediated NDUFV2 RNAi. Targeting insect mitochondrial complex I is expected to promote the development of the field application of RNAi as next-generation insect-proof crops.

For constitutive expression of dsRNAs in Arabidopsis and cotton, the fragment of HaNDUFV2 gene (197-560 bp in ORF)was amplified and inserted to the binary vector pCAMBlA2301 in sense and antisense direction interspaced bya 12O-bp intron of A.thaliana RTM1 gene(Mao et al.，20o7) to produce the construct 35S::dsHaNV2,or into vector pYL156 to produce the virus expressing dsRNA construct TRV:dsHaNV2.The region of 501-755 bp was used to produce the 35S:dsHaNV2(2)construct.Primers for constructs are listed in Table S5.The constructs were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains GV3101 (for Arabidopsis) and LBA4404 (for cotton） by electroporation. A.thaliana (Col-O) was transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998),and transgenic cotton was generated as described (Shangguan et al.,2008).

# Virus-mediated dsRNA expression

Agrobacterium harbouring pTRV1 or the modified pYL156 containing dsRNA fragments were grown at $2 8 ^ { \circ } C$ in a shaking incubator overnight.Cells were collected and suspended in $1 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ MES, $1 0 \mathrm { \ m u } \mathrm { M g } { \mathsf { C l } } _ { 2 }$ and $2 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ acetylsyringone solution to a final $\mathsf { O D 6 0 0 } = 2 . 0$ and then left at room temperature for $4 \ h$ .Mixed A. tumefaciens suspensions of pTRV1 and an equal volume of pYL156 or its derivatives were infiltrated into cotyledons of 10-day-old cotton seedlings，or 1-month-old tobacco leaves.Thirtydaysafter inoculation，fully expanded true leaves were collected for analysis or insect feeding assay.

# Insect feeding assay

Newand fully expended leaves from1-month-old Arabidopsis or 4-month-old cotton were used for feeding assays.For each experiment,the synchronous 2nd-instar larvae were selected and divided into three groups,each contained 18 individuals,unless otherwise indicated.After feeding on diets for indicated days, larvae were weighed and midgut was collect for further analysis. For lygus feeding assay, the 2nd-instar nymphs (2O per treatment) were reared with five cotton plants in a container for 7 days. Afterassay, nymphs were collected to determine survival rate and body weight. Statistical data analysis was performed using oneway ANOVA following Tukey's HSD (honest significant difference) test with SPSS software IBM,Armonk,New York,USA.

# RNA extraction and analysis

Total RNAs from cotton or Arabidopsis plants were extracted with a CTAB method (Zhao et al.,2012). Insect RNAs were extracted with TRlzol reagent (Ambion;Carlsbad，CA）according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of DNase I-treated total RNAs was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript I FirstStrand Synthesis SuperMix and oligo-dT or random primers (Life Technologies,Waltham,MA,USA).qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR-Green PCR Mastermix(TaKaRa,Dalian,China) on a cycler (Mastercycler RealPlex; Eppendorf，Hamburg，Germany）with primers listed in Table S5.Each biological replicate contained at least three technical replicates of the qPCR assay.

Foranalysis of small RNAs,the total RNA isolated from cotton leaves was precipitated with $50 \%$ isopropanol and then solubilized in water. High molecular weight RNA was precipitated with $30 \%$ polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 (Sigma,St.Louis,MO,USA), followed by precipitation of low molecular weight RNA by twice volumes of ethanol. The low molecular weight RNA was separated by $1 7 \%$ denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond $N ^ { + }$ nylon membrane (GE Healthcare,Little Chalfont, UK).The membrane was probed with biotin labelled U6 or HaNDUFV2 nucleotide and detected with Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module Kit (89880;Thermo Scientific, Waltham,MA,USA)according to the manufacturer's instruction.

# Transcriptome analysis

Total RNAs from midgut of cotton bollworm larvae fed on WT or 35S::dsHaNV2 cotton leaves for 2 days were extracted，and mRNAs were separated using oligo-dT magnetic beads and sheared into short fragments (E2oo bp) in the fragmentation buffer. The double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized and purifiedwith a QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen， Hilden, Germany).After end repair and ligation of sequencing adaptors, the fragments were purified and sequenced with a highthroughput sequencer (HiSeq 2ooo；Ilumina，San Diego，CA, USA)with paired-end read length of 2Oo bp.Three biological replicates were performed separately.After filtration，cleaned readswere assembled using SOAPdenovo (BGl,Beijing,China). Geneexpression levels were normalized and calculated as reads per kb per million reads values.

# Western blot analysis

Afterthe feedingassay,larval midgut tissueswere collected from each group,grinded in liquid nitrogen and extracted with protein extraction buffer ( $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ Tris, $\mathsf { p } \mathsf { H } 7 . 4$ ： $1 \%$ SDS) (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) and centrifuged for 5 min at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ to harvest the supernatant. Protein concentration was determined using the Thermo Scientific protein assay kit.Twenty micrograms of the extracted proteins was loaded per lane onto $10 \%$ Tris-glycine gels for electrophoresis and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Life Technologies).The membrane was blocked with $5 \%$ nonfat dry milk in PBST buffer (C520004，Sangon Biotech, Shanghai，China）for $1 \ h$ at room temperature，followed by incubation with anti-NDUFV2 antibody (HPA003404,Sigma，St. Louis，MO，USA)for $1 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at $4 ^ { \circ } C$ ：After washing with PBST buffer, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum (G-21234，Life Technology，Waltham，MA，USA)for $1 \ h$ at room temperature.The membrane was developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Life Technologies,Waltham,MA,USA).

# Transmission electron microscopy

The 2nd-instar larvae of H.armigera were reared on the transgenic or nontransgenic cotton leaves for 3 days,and midgut was detached bya sharp double-edge blade and immediately fixed in formalin-acetic acid-alcohol (FAA) solution.TEM was performed with HITACHI H-7650.

# Enzyme activity assays

Midgut was taken from each larva and washed with an ice-cold $0 . 9 \%$ NaCl solution.Mitochondria isolation from larval midgut and complex lactivity assay were performed as described (Frezza et al.，2o07;Janssen et al.，2oo7).The ATPase and superoxide dismutase (SOD)activities were detected with ATPase/GTPase Activity Assay Kit (Sigma) and SOD Assay Kit (Sigma),respectively. The MDA and GSH contents were determined with Lipid Peroxidation (MDA) Assay Kit (Sigma) and Glutathione Assay Kit (Sigma).Total antioxidant capacity assay was performed with Antioxidant Assay Kit (CS0790,Sigma)，and NAD+/NADH ratio

Was determined by the NAD/NADH Quantification Kit (MAK037, Sigma).
