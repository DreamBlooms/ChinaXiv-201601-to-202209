Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes have been widely applied to treat wastewater, however,the removal of toxic aromatic phenolic compounds remains a technical challenge due to the serious adsorption fouling and dificult degradation.Herein，we aimed to design a superhydrophilic PVDF membrane decorated with Au nanoparticles,which enhanced the rapid degradation of $p$ -nitrophenol (4-NP).The superhydrophilic PVDF membrane with a micro/nano structured surface was decorated with Au nanoparticles via poly(dopamine) (PDA)as a spacer.The influences of membrane affnity (e.g. Hydrophilic Membrane (HM),micro/nano structured superhydrophilic membrane (MSiM),and micro/ nano structured superhydrophobic membrane (MSoM)) on PDA deposition and the subsequent Au decoration were comprehensively investigated.The synthesized Au nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis absorption spectra.The morphology and composition was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM）and $\mathsf { X }$ -rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).Static catalytic experiments demonstrated that MSiM degraded over $90 \%$ of 4-NP in 5 minutes with a kinetic reaction rate constant of $4 7 . 8 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathsf { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ and high stability over 6 cycles.A membrane catalytic reactor (MCR) was designed to realize the continuous catalytic degradation of 4-NP with a kinetic reaction rate constant of $7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathsf { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$

# 1.Introduction

In recent years,nanocomposite materials have expanded markedly in membrane separation areas.Nano particles such as $\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ 1， $\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ 2， $\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ 3， $\mathbf { Z } \mathbf { r } \mathbf { O } _ { 2 } .$ 4 and $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ (ref.5) have been widely used to fabricate nanocomposite polymeric membranes due to theirhydrophilicity and large surface area-to-volume ratio. The porous polymeric membrane prevails in highly efficient separation in wastewater treatment，however， the separation performances are easily compromised by the fouling of proteins ororganic-molecules. Highlytoxicaromaticorganic compounds e.g. $p$ -nitrophenol are difficult to treat through traditional biodegradation. The reduction of $p$ -nitrophenol to $p$ （2 aminophenol via nano-catalysts provides an efficient solution. However,in heterogeneouscatalytic cases,the catalytic nanoparticles cannot be well dispersed in the solution,and also the recycling of the used catalysts is difficult due to the inevitable loss,which causes post energy and cost burden.The idea of integrating membrane separation with nanoparticle catalysis is most likely to overcome the above deficiencies.A membrane catalytic reactor (MCR) is capable of degrading the toxic micro-pollutantsand reducing the membrane fouling.Besides, the long term catalytic stability can be maintained via embed ding nano-catalysts firmly on the porous membranes.

Damodar et al. prepared a self-cleaning and antibacterial PVDFmembrane by incorporating different amounts of photo catalytic $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ $\left( 0 { - } 4 \mathrm { \quad } \mathrm { w t \% } \right)$ .Compared to the neat PVDF membrane,the $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ entrapped PVDF membrane showed abetter antibacterial ability under UV.However, the catalytic removal of RB5 is not as good as expected.Dotzauer et al. succeeded in the preparation of coating polyelectrolyte/Au nanoparticles on porous alumina membranes by a layer-by-layer adsorption method.' The modified alumina membranes reduced ${ > } 9 9 \%$ of $0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ 4-nitrophenol ata linear flow rate of $0 . 9 8 \ \mathrm { c m \ } s ^ { - 1 }$ . An antibacterial membrane can be prepared by dipping the membrane in dopamine and silver nitrate solution alternatively.’Besides,multilayer multi-metal nanoparticles canbe generated by repeating the dipping procedure in dopamine and metallic ion solution (e.g.Ag or Au),which demonstrated both enhanced antibacterial effects and catalytic degradation for methylene blue.

The previous research on the incorporation of nanoparticles into polymeric membranes are mainly to enhance the hydro philicity,fouling resistance or antibacterial performance.It is likewise of interest for producing a catalytic PVDF membrane for the degradation of toxic micro-pollutants e.g. aromatic compound $p$ -nitrophenol.PVDF was chosen as the substrate membrane due to its good chemical resistance， thermal stability and mechanical properties.1o-12 And the new composite functionalmaterialsuchasthecarbonnanotube/ poly(vinylidene fluoride) which can increase the dielectric constant at very low volume fractions was commendably researched as well.13-15 $p$ -Nitrophenol was chosen as the target molecule due to its difficultbiodegradationand high toxicity as a model of organic aromatic compounds.Poly(dopamine) (PDA) has drawn tremendous interest recently as an universal surface modification agent in wide applications of biotechnology,16-18 electrochemical,19,20 nanotechnology,21,22 and membrane23,24 applications. Typically，dopamine can be self-oxidized to produce an adhesive PDAlayer on variousmaterial surfaces in alkaline environments (e.g. $1 0 \mathrm { m M }$ Tris, $\mathrm { p H } 8 . 5 \$ 0.25ThePDAlayer provides reactive -OH groups,which consequently anchor the nanoparticles onto the substrate surface.6 The mechanism of the possible self-oxidation process of dopamine is suggested in Fig. 1.

Illuminated by the previous studies,we designed a feasible strategy to load Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) on a porous PVDF membrane using dopamine as a super bio-glue.Both the micro/ nano-morphology and the affinity of the porous PVDF membrane are crucial to the deposition of PDA and subsequent decoration with AuNPs.In our previous work,we fabricated a superhydrophilic-superoleophilic membrane with a micro/ nano textured surface via a template methodology，which showed excellent oil/water separation performance.27 The specially designed micro/nano surface will possibly promote the adsorption of PDA and Au nanoparticles thanks to the high specific area and the high hydrophilicity.Herein,we aim to designa membrane catalytic reactor (MCR) to realize the high efficient static and dynamic degradation of $p$ -nitrophenol.The synthesis route of the catalyticPVDF membraneisillustrated in Fig.2.PVDF membranes with different affinities were first prepared by phase separation.28,29 The prepared membranes were deposited by the PDA layer via self-oxidation.Finally,

# 2.Experimental section

# 2.1 Materials

PVDF (Kynar 761A,Arkema) dried at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ was used toprepare the membrane.Triethyl phosphate (TEP),vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES, $9 8 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ )，and sodiumborohydride $\mathrm { ( N a B H _ { 4 } }$ ， $9 8 \ \mathrm { w t \% } \$ )were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical reagent Co.Dopamine hydrochloride (98 wt%，Aldrich), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane(Tris, $9 9 . 9 ~ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ,Aldrich), $\mathbf { H A u C l } _ { 4 } \cdot x \mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ (Au $4 7 . 8 \ \mathrm { w t \% }$ ), $^ { 2 , 2 ^ { \prime } }$ -azobis(2-methyl propionitrile) (AIBN, $9 9 \%$ ，Aladdin), $p$ -nitrophenol (4-NP, $9 8 \ \mathrm { w t \% }$ Aldrich) and deionized water were all directly used without further purification.

# 2.2Synthesis ofAuNPs

All glassware was thoroughly cleaned in aqua regia (3 parts HCl, 1 part ${ \bf H N O } _ { 3 , }$ ，rinsed in triply distilled $\mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ ，and oven-dried prior to use.Au NPs were synthesized using sodium citrate reduction of $\mathrm { \ H A u C l _ { 4 } }$ in deionized water.Au colloids were prepared according to Frens3o or Sutherland31 with slight modifications.

Typically, $9 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of deionized water was brought to a rolling boil $( 1 2 0 \ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } )$ with vigorous stirring $( 8 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { \ r p m } ) }$ which was continued for10 min.10 mL of sodium citrate wasadded to the solution in one minute,which resulted in a color change from pale yellow to wine red in 1O minutes after adding $1 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of $2 . 5 \mathrm { ~ M ~ H A u C l _ { 4 } }$ to the vortex of the solution.The solution was under continuous stirring at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for 20 minutes.

# 2.3Preparation of the PVDF membranes with different affinities

The hydrophilicity of PVDF membranes will influence the deposition of PDA and the decoration with AuNPs.Therefore,

PVDFmembraneswith different affinities(hydrophilic membrane (HM),，micro/nano structured superhydrophilic membrane(MSiM)， and micro/nanostructured superhydrophobic membrane (MSoM)) were produced respectivelyas follows:

HM and MSiM are both prepared using an interfacial crosslinking strategy.Ahydrophilic precopolymer solution was first synthesized: $_ { 0 . 0 8 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of AIBN, $3 . 7 5 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ of NVP and $2 . 7 5 \ \mathrm { g }$ of VTES were dissolved in $_ { 1 1 0 0 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of TEP. The solution was vigorously stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for1 hour at room temperature to remove the oxygen.Then the temperature was upgraded to $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ with vigorous stirring to obtain the final hydrophilic precopolymer P(VP-VTES) solution.

For the fabrication of HMandMSiM: $_ { 1 5 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of PVDF in $8 5 ~ \mathrm { g }$ of triethyl phosphate (TEP) was totally dissolved at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ The reactionwascarried outat $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ withvigorous stirring for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ Afterwards,the PVDF solution was spread onto a clean glass plate or non-woven fabric (NWF) $( 7 0 \mathrm { ~ g ~ m ~ } ^ { - 2 } )$ using a casting knife with a thickness of $3 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ .The nascent membrane was immediatelyimmersed intoa $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ coagulation bath composed of a TEP/water mixture $\left( \mathbf { v } / \mathbf { v } \colon 1 / 1 \right)$ for $\textbf { 5 s }$ ,and moved to a pure water bath for total solidification.The membrane was transferred to $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ fresh deionized water for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ,and dried in the air for $2 4 \ \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to get the nascent membrane.Finally， the membrane peeled from the glass plate was immersed in the above synthesized hydrophilic precopolymer P(VP-VTES) solution for $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ atroom temperature for the hydrolysis,condensation and interfacial crosslinking to obtain HM.Similarly,the membrane with the non-woven fabric (NWF) was first dipped in theabove synthesized hydrophilic precopolymer P(VP-VTES) solution for $^ \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ at room temperature and then transferred into the citric acid solution $( 1 ~ \mathrm { w t \% } )$ for $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ to boost the interfacial crosslinking.The resultant membrane wasdried and peeledoff from the NWF to obtain the MSiM.

For the fabrication of the MSoM, $_ { 1 5 \mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of PVDF in $8 5 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ of triethyl phosphate (TEP) was totally dissolved at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C } .$ The solution was carried out at $8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ with vigorous stirring for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ Afterwards,the PVDF solution was spread onto a non-woven fabric NWF $( 7 0 \mathrm { ~ g ~ m ~ } ^ { - 2 } )$ using a casting knife with a thickness of $3 0 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ . The pristine membrane was immediately immersed into a $2 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ coagulation bath composed of a TEP/water mixture $\left( \mathbf { v } / \mathbf { v } \colon 1 / 1 \right)$ for $\textsf { 5 s }$ ,and then moved to a pure water bath for total solidification.The resultant membrane was dried and peeled from the NWF to obtain the MSoM.

# 2.4Preparation of the Au-PDA-PVDF membranes

$0 . 2 { \mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ of dopamine was dissolved in $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m L } }$ of Tris buffer $\left( \mathrm { p H } = \right.$ 8.5),the hydrophilic PVDF membrane (HM) (A), the micro/nano structured superhydrophilic membrane (MSiM) (B),and the micro/nano structured superhydrophobic membrane (MSoM) (C) prepared above were immersed into the dopamine solution for 2,8 and $2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ at room temperature to embed a PDA layer on the surface of the PVDF membrane $( \mathrm { A } _ { 2 } , \mathrm { A } _ { 8 } , \mathrm { A } _ { 2 4 } , \mathrm { B } _ { 2 } , \mathrm { B } _ { 8 } , \mathrm { B } _ { 2 4 } , \mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ $\mathbf { C } _ { 8 } , \ \mathbf { C } _ { 2 4 } )$ .Subsequently，the PDA-coated samples were thoroughly washed with deionized (DI) water and immersed in $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of the Au colloidal solution for $2 4 \mathrm { h }$ at room temperature to obtain the catalytic Au-PDA-PVDF membrane $( \mathbf { A } _ { 2 - \mathbf { A u } } , \mathbf { A } _ { 8 - \mathbf { A u } } ,$ ${ \bf A } _ { 2 4 - \mathrm { A u } }$ ， $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ . ${ \bf B } _ { \mathrm { { 8 - A u } } }$ . $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 4 - \mathbf { A u } }$ ， $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 - \mathbf { A u } }$ 1 ${ \bf C } _ { \bf { 8 } - \bf { A u } }$ . $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 4 - \mathrm { A u } } \mathbf { \Sigma } ,$ .Thedetailsare shown in Table 1.

# 2.5 Characterization of the membranes

Surface morphologies of the PVDF membranes were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM，Hitachi S-4800, Japan).The membrane roughness was measured using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM,Zeiss LSM 70o,Germany).The contact angle variation with drop age was recorded using a water contact angle system (OCA2o,Dataphysics,Germany).The membrane surface composition was determined using XPS analysis (AXIS UTLTRADLD, Japan),using Al $\kappa a$ as the radiation source.

# 2.6 Catalytic performance measurement

For the static catalytic performance,a modified membrane with an area of $0 . 6 \times 0 . 7 ~ \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ was immersed into $1 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ of aqueous 4-NP $( 2 . 7 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \mathrm { ~ M } )$ . Subsequently,the above solution was mixed with $1 . 5 \ \mathrm { m L }$ of fresh $\mathrm { \Delta N a B H _ { 4 } }$ solution $\left( 0 . 0 4 8 \mathrm { ~ M } \right)$ . The reaction was carried out at room temperature at a standstill. With the help of UV-vis spectroscopy (Lambda 950,US),we evaluated the catalytic performance of the membrane.

For the dynamic catalytic performance,a membrane catalytic reactor (MCR) was designed via a dead-end filtration mode. A peristaltic pump (BT3oo-1F,Longer Pump,China) was used to control the solution flowing rate $0 . 1 2 1 \mathrm { ~ m L ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ for continuous circulation at room temperature. The diameter of the membrane is $2 . 5 ~ \mathrm { c m }$ ,anda mixed solution composed of 4-NP $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ $2 . 7 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \mathrm { M } )$ and $\mathrm { { N a B H _ { 4 } } }$ 0 $7 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ ,0.048 M) was used in the experiment.

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1Catalytic properties of the AuNPs

As showninFig.3,theaverage diameterof the AuNPs is ${ \sim } 4 0 \mathrm { n m }$ from the TEM image.The catalytic activity of the AuNPs toward 4-NP reduction is convincingly confirmed by the UV spectra in Fig.3.Usually, the UV-vis peak of pure 4-NP aqueous solution is at ${ \sim } 3 1 7 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ ,however,thisadsorptionpeak shifted to ${ \sim } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ due to the formation of 4-nitrophenolate ions after the reducer $\mathrm { \Delta N a B H _ { 4 } }$ wasadded.With the addition of the AuNPs into the mixture,4-NP was rapidly reduced to $p$ -aminophenol (4-AP) in $6 0 ~ \mathrm { s }$ ,which was verified by the complete disappearance of the pristine strong peak at ${ \sim } 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and the appearance of new peaks at $2 3 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and ${ 3 0 0 } \mathrm { n m }$ .32,33 However, the dispersed AuNPs in the solution are difficult to recycle and reuse due to the energy-consuming separation.Since the catalytic activity of Au is strongly dependant on the particle size,the reduction efficiency will be gradually retarded by the freely dispersed Au aggregation.To circumvent these distressing blocks，AuNPs were therefore integrated and anchored on porous membranes with different affinities.We will disclose the influences of the chemical affnity and physical texture on the dopamine deposition and AuNP immobilization.

# 3.2Morphology and hydrophilicity of the PVDF membranes

The morphology and confocal roughness of the HM,MSiM and MSoM are shown in Fig.4.The bottom surface of the HM with Rsa $1 . 9 0 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ was obviously flattened by the glass plate despite the presence of micropores.While for both the MSiM and MSoM，versatile textures are produced including microscaled petals,leaf-like structures and nanoscaled fibers by the NWF peeling.The roughness of the MSiMand MSoMis increased to $5 . 8 3 1 \mathrm { n m }$ and $6 . 4 1 5 \mathrm { n m }$ .Themicro/nano texture was generated during the phase separation and well preserved by the flexible NWF template.The HM and MSiM were further modified using the interfacial crosslinking strategy to acquire better wettability.Specifically,PVP-VTES was firmly bonded on the rough membrane surface by the silane-based chemical crosslinking.

Fig.4 SEM images with a magnification $\times 1 0 . 0 \mathsf { k }$ and confocal roughness of (A),(a) HM,(B),(b) MSiM and (C),(c) MSoM respectively.

As shown in Fig.5,the initial contact angle of the HMwas $2 7 . 7 ^ { \circ }$ ,and decreased rapidly to O in about 6 s,showing the good hydrophilicity. The MSiM showed instantaneous wettability witha prompt decay of contact angle from $1 9 . 1 ^ { \circ }$ to oin $2 . 5 { \mathrm { ~ s } } { \mathrm { . } }$ The corresponding superhydrophilicity was mainly endowed by both the surface crosslinked PVP and micro/nano structure.In comparison， theMSoMdemonstratedstablesuperhydrophobicitywithacontactangle ashighas $1 5 2 . 3 ^ { \circ }$ owing to the versatile texture and high roughness.The wettability influences the permeability despite the similar porous structure.The pure water flux of the HM,MSiMand MSoMis $7 0 0 0 \mathrm { L m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ $8 0 0 0 \mathrm { L m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ and $8 0 \mathrm { L m } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ respectively.Both the physical texture and chemical affinity of the membrane are anticipated to affect PDA deposition and subsequent AuNP growth.

# 3.3Morphology and chemistry of the Au-PDA-PVDF membranes

Mussel-inspired chemistry is a simple,universal,environmentallybenign and multifunctional strategy to tune surface engineering.Dopamine hasahigh tendency to forma self-oxidation PDA coating on various polymeric substrates under alkaline conditions and air atmosphere.The PDA coating layer acts as aspacer for the post-modification.However, the deposition of dopamine is significantly influenced by surface chemistry, wettability and the microstructure due to the complex covalent and non-covalent interactions (including hydrogen bonding, $\scriptstyle { \pi - }$ $\pi$ stacking and charge transfer interactions etc.).The varied morphological evolutions of the HM,MSiM and MSoM with different deposition times in dopamine solution for 2h,8 h and $2 4  { \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ are shown in Fig.6.It can be seen that the selfpolymerization of dopaminemainly happened onthe membrane surface,while the cross section deep inside the membrane was almost not influenced by PDA.34 Obviously,the MSiM adsorbed more PDA particles than the HM and MSoM. With extending the deposition time from $^ { \mathrm { ~ 2 ~ h ~ } }$ to $^ { 2 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，more polydopamine particles with a size of ${ \sim } 1 0 0$ nm were agglomerated and attached to the grooves,fibers，petals and leaves of the membrane surface.Distinctly different from the MSiM,the MSoM adsorbed much less PDA despite the deposition time.Actually， the surface deposition and the selfpolymerization in the solution happened competitively.35-37 The diffusion of hydrophilic dopamine onto the membrane interface is dominating the subsequent surface deposition and growth of the PDA.The MSoM surface repels the diffusion and adsorption of dopamine through the superhydrophobic interactions.Therefore,more PDA tend to be self-polymerized in the solution rather than on the membrane surface.While the superhydrophilic surface favors the diffusion and adsorption of dopamine through hydrophilic interaction.Consequently more PDA was self-polymerized on the membrane surface to form an intermediate bio-glue spacer attributed to amino,imino, hydroxyl and catechol functional group interactions.38,39 Besides,surface crosslinked PVP segments on the membrane can also form hydrogen bonds with dopamine to promote the adsorption of PDA，which is in accordance with previous studies.40,41

The PDA deposited PVDF membrane was capable of capturing AuNPs through the strong adsorption. The Au-PDA-PVDF membrane was therefore produced via simple immersion for $2 4 ~ \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .Both the membrane affinity and immersion time will influence the growth and embedding of the AuNPs on the membrane surface.The AuNPs distribution was observed inFig.7witha high magnification of $\times 5 0 . 0 \mathrm { k }$ .It can be seen that the $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ ， $\mathbf { B } _ { \mathbf { 8 - A u } }$ and $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 4 - \mathbf { A u } }$ membrane anchored a certain amount of AuNPs with a diameter of ${ \sim } 4 0$ nm,which is circled in the image.PDA particles with a diameter of ${ \sim } 1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ are identifed by a red arrow. $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ showedaquite uniform distributionofAuNPs.However, the agglomeration of AuNPs is getting more serious with extending the deposition time of PDA,demonstrating that higher amounts of AuNPs are embedded onto the MSiM membranes through the bio-glue spacer.Lower amounts of

Fig.7SEM images with magnification $\times 5 0 . 0 \mathsf { k }$ of the Au-PDA-PVDF membranes.

AuNPs are distributed on the ${ \bf A } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ ， ${ \bf A } _ { { \bf 8 } - { \bf A } { \bf u } }$ and ${ \bf A } _ { 2 4 - \mathrm { A u } }$ membrane surface without serious agglomeration. The $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ ${ \bf C } _ { \bf { 8 } - \bf { A u } }$ and $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 4 - \mathbf { A u } }$ membrane anchored a lower amount of AuNPs. From the AuNPs distribution on the PVDF membranes with different affinities,we can see that the presence of PDA plays a crucial role for anchoring AuNPs as a bio-glue.Itis probably thought that the active -OH groups ofPDA are responsible for the assembly of the AuNPs.The hydrophilic surface with the micro/nano structure will promote the deposition of PDA and favor the growth of AuNPs accordingly.4² Therefore,the superhydrophilic PVDF membrane $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ with the hierarchical surface captured more AuNPs than others.Nevertheless,the intensive agglomeration can decay the membrane catalytic performance.The Au element mass concentration was confirmed using XPS as shown in Table 2. $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathbf { A u } }$ displayed the highest Au content of $5 . 4 3 \%$ ， ${ \bf A } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ showed a lower Au loading of $3 . 3 3 \%$ ,and $\mathbf { C } _ { 2 - \mathbf { A u } }$ onlypossessed $0 . 4 \%$ Au.The chemistry composition is well in accordance with the SEM distribution.

# 3.4Static catalytic performance of the Au-PDA-PVDF membrane

The remediation of micro-polluted water containing nitro phenols and derivatives is urgent and challenging.The degra dation of toxic aromatic phenolic compounds from dyes, herbicides,pesticides and wastewater is difficult to treat via the traditional biodegradation methods e.g. MBR.Besides，the accumulation of the non-degradable compounds on the membrane interface will aggravate the fouling concern. Herein, the reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) using $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ was chosen as the model reaction to evaluate the catalytic performance of the Au-PDA-PVDF membrane.The reduced 4-AP is less toxic and useful in many applications including analgesic and antipyretic drugs，photographic developer，corrosion inhibitor,anticorrosion lubricant,and so on.43-46 The reduction of 4-NP using $\mathrm { \Delta N a B H _ { 4 } }$ in the presence of noble metal nanoparticles has been intensively investigated for the efficient production of 4-AP.47 Usually versatile AuNPs with different sizes,in the forms of spheres,rods,shells,stars,cages etc.are synthesized and directly dispersed in the 4-NP solution for the catalytic reduction.However,the dispersed AuNPs are difficult to recycle and also the catalytic activity will be impaired due to the gradual aggregation. To overcome the deficiency, the AuNPs are therefore firmly anchored and integrated onto a PVDF membrane.Au-PDA-PVDF (MSiM) was immersed in the 4-NP solution instead of freely dispersed AuNPs.The mixtures of 4- NP and $\mathrm { { N a B H } _ { 4 } }$ show a strong adsorption peak at $4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ ,corresponding to the 4-NP ions under alkaline conditions.48 After the Au-PDA-PVDF catalytic membrane was added into the mixture,the reduction process was monitored by measuring the time-dependent adsorption spectra.As shown in Fig.8,the absorption intensity of the 4-NP at $4 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ decreases quickly with time,accompanied by the appearance of the new peaks of 4-AP at $2 3 0 \mathrm { n m }$ and ${ 3 0 0 } \mathrm { n m }$ ,indicating the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP.49 It is worth noting that the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP was completely finished in5 minutes upon the addition of the MSiM $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathbf { A u } }$ as shown in Fig. 8a. The yellow-green color of the pristine aqueous solution undergoes a fading and ultimate bleaching. With increasing the PDA deposition time,the catalytic reduction of 4-NP for $\mathbf { B } _ { \mathbf { 8 - A u } }$ and $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 4 - \mathrm { A u } }$ was not further accelerated in Fig. 8b and c. It is speculated that the aggregation has a negative impact on the catalysis.Due to the presence of a large excess of $\mathrm { N a B H _ { 4 } }$ compared to 4-NP,the rate of reduction is independent of the concentration of $\mathrm { \Delta N a B i H _ { 4 } }$ .The reaction could be considered to be pseudo-first-order with respect to the concentration of 4-NP.50 Hence, $\ln ( C _ { t } / C _ { 0 } )$ versus time can be obtained based on the absorbance as the function of time,and a good linear correlation was observed as shown in Fig.8d,suggesting that the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP follows pseudo-first-order kinetics.The kinetic reaction rate constantis calculated from the slope of the linear relationship to be $1 5 . 5 3 \times { 1 0 } ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ (24 h), $4 2 . 1 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ (8 h), $4 7 . 8 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { m i n ^ { - 1 } ( 2 h ) } .$ $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ displayed superior catalytic performance to otherAu embedded substrates.51-53 It could be elucidated that the superhydrophilic surface and $\pi { - } \pi$ stacking interactions between the dopamine and 4-NP promoted the initial adsorption，and therefore enhanced the local concentration of 4-NP on the membrane interface.Besides,plenty of confined micropores in the hierarchical membrane surface caged the phenolic compounds. Finally, the well distributed AuNPs on $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ were able to catalyze the reduction reaction efficiently.

In comparison，the HM was also used to catalyze the reduction of 4-NP.It was found that $9 0 \%$ of 4-NP was reduced in ${ \sim } 1 4$ minutes via the catalysis of ${ \bf A } _ { 2 4 - { \bf A } { \bf u } }$ as shown in Fig.9c. The reaction rate constant of $\mathbf { A } _ { 2 - \mathbf { A u } } , \mathbf { A } _ { 8 - \mathbf { A u } }$ and ${ \bf A } _ { 2 4 - \mathrm { A u } }$ is $1 0 . 4 4 \times { { 1 0 } ^ { - 2 } }$ $\operatorname* { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ (2 h), $1 4 . 1 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ (8 h) and $2 0 . 4 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 2 }$ (24h) respectively inFig.9d.With extending thePDAdeposition time,the reduction time was shortened accordingly.It is mainly because the embedding of AuNPs on the HMis far beyond the agglomeration.Therefore，prolonging the deposition time favorsthecatalyticreduction. Thesuperhydrophobic membrane didn't show any catalytic reduction of 4-NP even in1 h.The superhydrophobicity of the MSoM makes it difficult to load AuNPs on the MSoM, the poor catalytic performance may be due to the hydrophobicity and the lack of AuNPs on the membrane.

The complexity in separating and recovering the Au nanoparticles from the reaction solution restricted the catalytic stabilityof the freelydispersed catalysts.The Au-PDA-PVDF membrane eliminated the concerns of catalyst loss and catalytic stability.The MSiM exhibiteda good recyclability forthe catalytic reduction of 4-NP.It was found that more than $8 5 \%$ of the 4-NP was still reduced to 4-AP in 15 minutes even after 6 cycles as shown in Fig.1o.In contrast, the freely dispersed AuNPs lost the pristine catalytic performance dramatically after reuse due to the severe aggregation of the Au nanoparticles and the loss of catalytic activity.Only $1 0 \%$ of the 4-NP was reduced even in 15minutes.The results demonstrated that the AuNP modified superhydrophilic PVDF membrane has an excellent catalytic activityand goodreusability.

# 3.5Membrane catalytic reactor (MCR)

A membrane catalytic reactor (MCR) was designed by sealing a piece of Au-PDA-PVDF membrane $\left( \mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } } , D = 2 . 5 \mathrm { c m } \right)$ in a cell. The 4-NP aqueous solution was circulated in the MCR using a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of $0 . 1 2 1 \mathrm { ~ m L ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ . The sufficiently high flux is calculated as $8 8 7 . 2 ~ \mathrm { L ~ m } ^ { - 2 } ~ \mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 }$ .The fltrate was collected at different operation durations and analyzed usingUV as shown in Fig.11.With extending the circulation time,the adsorption peak at ${ \sim } 4 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ declined and the peaks at $2 3 0 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ and ${ 3 0 0 } ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ grew gradually,indicating the conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP. $9 0 \%$ of the 4-NP was successfully reduced to 4- APin 30 min.4-NP was first adsorbed and adhered to the surface of the AuNPs via the oxygen atoms of the nitro group and formed an intermediate,which activated the electron transport from the donor $\mathrm { B H _ { 4 } } ^ { - }$ ions to the 4-NP.This finally realized the reduction of the nitro group to the amino group.54,55 From the analysis of the catalytic mechanism,we can see that theresistance time in the MCR influences the contacting of 4-AP with the AuNPs.The kinetic reaction rate constant was determined to be $7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ from the slope of the $\ln ( C _ { t } / C _ { 0 } )$ versus time plots in Fig.11. Nevertheless,it is promising to realize the instantaneous catalytic degradation of 4-NP ina flowthrough mode when a less porous membrane was applied. Overall, the proof of concept membrane catalytic reactor was successfully verified using the continuous catalytic degradation of 4-NP.

# 4. Conclusion

Insummary,acatalytic PVDF membrane integrated withAuNPs through PDA as a spacer was successfully prepared for the degradation of 4-NP.The chemical affinity and physical micro/ nano structure dominated the deposition of PDA and decoration with the AuNPs,which was confirmed using SEMand XPS. Thesynergistic effect of superhydrophilicity，hierarchical micropores,and the bio-glue PDA enhanced the adsorption of 4-NP. The well distributed AuNPs on $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 - \mathrm { A u } }$ acquired superior catalytic performance. $9 0 \%$ of 4-NP was reduced in 5 minutes, and the kinetic reaction rate constant was $4 7 . 8 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ Also $\mathbf { B } _ { 2 \cdot \mathbf { A } \mathbf { u } }$ showed excellent catalytic stability and recyclability. More than $9 0 \%$ of 4-NP was reduced to 4-AP in 30 minutes in a membrane catalytic reactor.The kinetic reaction rate constant is $7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \mathrm { \ m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ . We show that this approach enables the stable immobilization of nano-catalysts on the surface of aporous membrane.The integrated MCR overcomes the current limitation of a sole filtration membrane or freely dispersed catalysts.The membrane reactor is expected to be valuable to effciently remove high toxic micro-pollutants e.g. aromatic compounds,pesticides,dyes and pharmaceuticals etc.
