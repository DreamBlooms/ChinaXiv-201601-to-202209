These findings suggest that the galectin-9-Tim-3 pathway may be critical in the immunoevasion of glioma and may be a potent target for immunotherapy in glioma patients. ",

        "text": "In general, the glioma environment may remold and immunoedit immune cells that infiltrate the tumor, resulting in the tumor cells escaping from immune surveillance (23). Several mechanisms of tumor cell immune evasion have been studied. One mechanism is the expression of immune checkpoint molecules on activated T cells infiltrating the tumor,including PD-1,cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 and Tim-3 (24). Tim-3 is often co-expressed with PD-1 onexhaustedTcells,whichare Tcellswithadecreased ability to express cytotoxic cytokines,including $\\mathrm { I F N - } \\gamma$ and tumor necrosis factor- $\\mathrm { \\bf q }$ ,when they are continuously exposed to antigens (22).Co-blockade of the two pathways has been demonstrated to be an effective way of reversing the exhaustion of $\\mathrm { C D 8 ^ { + } }$ T cells (25). Tim-3 may be highly upregulated on tumor-infiltrated-lymphocytes compared with T cells in the peripheral blood of tumors (26,27).In addition,the present study detected a low expression level of Tim-3 on healthy PBMCs,and a low expression of galectin-9 on non-cancerous brain tissues.However, Tim-3 and galectin-9 were expressed at an increased level in TILs and glioma tissues,respectively, and the expression was associated with tumor malignancy. The present study suggests that malignant tumors may create an immunosuppressive environment by increasing the expression of immunosuppressive molecules,including galectin-9,in tumors.When activated T cells infiltrate the tumors,the interaction of Tim-3 on T cells with galectin-9 expressed by tumors induces dysfunction or exhaustion of the tumor-infltrating T cells.
