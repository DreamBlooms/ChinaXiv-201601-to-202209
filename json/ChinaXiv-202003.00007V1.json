TCC is a typical form of mind-body exercise originating in ancient China, which involves meditation, mental concentration, musculoskeletal stretching, and diaphragmatic breathing with choreographed movements [5, 6]. Given increasing evidences demonstrate its beneficial effect on behavioral performance,it has been accepted for symptomatic management of some chronic diseases. For instance,a recent study by Wang et al. [7] observed that 12-month TCC intervention resulted in similar or greater improvement in disease specific symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia compared to those engaging in the same dose of aerobic exercise. Some evidence also indicates that TCC practice can regulate emotion and relieve the symptoms of mood disorders [8,9]. Additionally, a number of behavioral studies demonstrated that TCC can improve cognitive function (e.g. executive function, reaction time)[10,11]. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying such improvements, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on TCC practitioners. These studies reported that experienced TCC practitioners exhibited greater cortical thickness [11] and larger brain volumes,relative to healthy controls [12,13]. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies indicated that long-term TCC practice optimizes functional connectivity (FC) in brain regions which play key roles in cognitive-motor integration in adults [14- 17]. These findings indicate that TCC practice may reshape brain function and could be associated with cognitive improvements. ",

Additionally, this analysis was also applied to investigate the aberrant interhemispheric FC in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder,and panic disorder [21-23].

To the best of our knowledge,it is the first study to utilize VMHC analysis method to explore regional specific difference of functional homotopy between TCC experts and controls. We observed decreased VMHC values in MFG in TCC group and significant negative relationship between total TCC time and VMHC in precuneus and precentral. These findings indicate that the possibility of local plasticity in functional specialization of brain as function of extensive training. ",

        "text": "Left-right asymmetry is a key feature of the human brain structure and function [28]. A largestever analysis ofcerebral cortical asymmetry found that regional asymmetries in cortical thickness and/or surface area are extensively present in the inferior frontal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus,and entorhinal cortex of healthy individuals [29]. Gotts et al. [30] also pointed out that two distinct forms of functional specialization were present in the left versus the right cerebral hemisphere.The left hemisphere tends to interact more exclusively with itself,while the cortical regions of the right hemisphere involved in visuospatial and atentional processing tend to interact in a more integrative fashion with both hemispheres.The widespread lateralization across species may suggest an evolutionary advantage associated with the specialization of the hemispheres [31]. An earlier study developing the VMHC approach found that homotopic regions in the prefrontal cortex (particularly those in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral regions responsible for attention, cognition, and language) exhibited lower coherence [19]. This finding indicates that functional specialization, especially in the higher-order cerebral cortex, is closely associated with human cognition. ",

        "text": "The most interesting finding in our study is the detection of decreased VMHC in MFG. The prefrontal lobe is generally considered to be the high-order cognitive and executive center which integrates the information from internal sources and the external environment [32,33]. As a part of the prefrontal lobe, MFG plays an important role in complex information processing related to goaldirected cognition [34]. Several studies demonstrated that the alteration in functional activity in the MFG is associated with improved cognitive performance, which can be induced by extensive TCC training. A six-week TCC intervention elicited increased spontaneous activation in the right MFG which was associated with improved cognitive performance. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) changes in the right MFG and changes in executive function among participants who were involved in a six-week intervention including Tai Chi exercise [35]. The functional difference in MFG between TCC experts and controls possibly suggest greater functional plasticity in MFG. Decreased VMHC in MFG suggests that functional specialization of MFG may reflect enhanced utilization of the functional cortex, which resulted in better cognitive ability among TCC practitioners in this study.

        "text": "Decreased VMHC in precuneus was associated with TCC experience. As a component of the default-mode network (DMN), precuneus functions as the brain region processing emotional information and multiple higher-order cognitive functions [36,37], such as attention shifting, memory retrieval,and spatial coordination [38]. Increasing evidence demonstrates that meditation practice can induce structural and functional changes in the precuneus [39, 40]. A recent TCC study demonstrated that TCC experts had decreased fractional ALFF in DMN,compared to healthy controls [17], which directly supports the perception that the precuneus brain region can be altered by meditative training. Importantly, a number of studies confirmed that meditative exercise can change the precuneus asymmetry [41, 42]. The decreased VMHC in precuneus provided further evidence that TCC is likely to alter the inter-hemispheric functional integration in the precuneus. ",

        "text": "In addition to the precuneus,precentral sulcus is another brain region which exhibits significant association with TCC experience.Located in the primary motor cortex, precentral sulcus is responsible for observation and execution of motor tasks 43]. A study reported that the lateralization of sensorimotor networks (including precentral gyrus) decreases with aging [44],suggesting that aging may lead to decreased hemispheric specialization.Fujiyama et al. [45] found that aging adults show bilateral recruitment of primary motor cortex while younger adults show a suppression of the ipsilateral motor cortex during motor tasks. It is plausible that TCC practice enhances lateral function in the sensorimotor cortex to protect against aging,thereby improving the capability of motor-related information processing. Luders et al. [46, 47] suggested that long-term meditation practitioners may have younger brains. Since TCC shares a number of mental components with meditation (such as concentration and relaxation), these findings may help us beter understand the neural mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of TCC practice on motor ability.
