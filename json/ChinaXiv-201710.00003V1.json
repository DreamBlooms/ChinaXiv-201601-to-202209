        "text": "AbstractThe traditional serial grinding method used to investigate the internal structure of fossils cannot be readily applied to valuable fosil specimens due to its destructive and timeconsuming nature. Computed tomography (CT） is an ideal non-destructive technique for investigating the internal structure of fossils, in which thousands of serial images are obtained and used to produce an accurate reconstruction of the internal morphology. This paper reviews the design,development and applications of the first CT system in China dedicated exclusively to scanning fossils.

The marble has been processed using a combination of automated and manual approaches, in order to minimize potential imprecision caused by fluctuations in temperature (which can cause small changes in the size of the piece of marble) and other environmental parameters, as well as smaller amounts of deformation caused by internal stress arising from the marble's material properties. The fossil micro-CT is equipped with a high precision electronic control rotary table (HUBER410, Germany) that maintains its exact position when loaded with a fossil, ensuring that no errors are introduced as a result of specimen misalignment. In both devices, the system takes a series of X-ray images (also called \"projections” or“frames\") at small angular intervals as the specimen rotates through a full $3 6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . Multiple frames are taken at each point, and averaged to produce a less noisy composite image. The composite images are then combined by software to produce the final CT data set for the specimen.Both paleontological CT devices are shown in Fig.1. C ",

The precision of the movement of the rotary table along the slide rail is guaranteed by a linear optical encoder, comprising a readhead paired with a scale. The readhead reads the scale in order to encode the current position of the rotary table,which is converted into a digital pulse signal and transmited to the motion control system.This system ensures that the position of the rotary table is precisely known at al times.A positive limit point and a negative limit point, which respectively define the minimum allowable distance from the rotary table to the X-ray tube (which emits X-rays) and to the detector (which receives X-rays after they have passed through the specimen), constrain the movement of the rotary table. The boundaries represented by the positive limit point and negative limit point prevent fossil specimens from colliding with either the tube or the detector. A home point, considered to represent a zero point for the system,is set between the positive and negative limit points.Furthermore,a safety light curtain extending between a transmiting device and a receiving device is installed between the X-ray tube and the fossl sample,and is connected to the motion control system. If \"the fossil or another object interrupts the light curtain, motion of the system will immediately cease. This design ensures that the motion control system will be stopped by fedback before making contact with the fossil sample, preventing the sample from suffering damage under any circumstances. \" ",
