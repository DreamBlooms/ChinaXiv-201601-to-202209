The spherical-box approach is extended to calculate the resonance parameters and the real part of the wave function for single particle resonances in a potential containing the long-range Coulomb interaction. A model potential is taken to demonstrate the ability and accuracy of this approach. The calculated resonance parameters are compared with available results from other methods. It is shown that in the presence of the Coulomb interaction, the spherical-box approach works well for not so broad resonances. In particular, for very narrow resonances, the present method gives resonance parameters in a very high precision. ",

For the theoretical determination of resonant parameters (the energy and the width)，in addition to many approaches which are based on the connection of the unbound states (including resonances and antibound or virtual states） and the poles of the S matrix， several bound-state-like methods have been developed， e.g, the complex scaling method (CSM) [1，2, 3,4, 5,6, 7,8, 9], the complex absorbing potential (CAP) method [10,11], the analytical continuation in the coupling constant (ACCC) approach [12, 13,14,15,16,17, 18,19, 20],and the real stabilization method (RSM) [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30].

The RSM is based on the fact that the energy of a “resonant” state is “stable” against the change of the size of the basis or the box. Many efforts have been made in order to calculate more effciently resonance parameters with the RSM [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. One of the effective ways to do so is the so called “spherical-box approach” [24] in which the energy and width of a resonance in finite-range potentials are determined from the variation of the discrete positive energies with the radius of the box. The spherical-box approach for short range potential has been vigorously proved [31]. In a recent work [30], the single neutron resonances in atomic nuclei were investigated by combining the RSM and the relativistic mean field model [32, 33]. ",

For the first s wave resonance which is quite narrow, the wave function is almost completely localized inside the range of the finite range potential $V _ { 0 } ( r ) = 7 . 5 ~ r ^ { 2 } e ^ { - r }$ . But for the broad s resonance, the radial wave function inside the potential barrier is much depressed and it oscillates very much in the asymptotic region. For the p wave resonance,one still finds a localization feature in its radial wave function, but not so prominent as the case of the first s resonant state. The wave function of the d resonance is similar to that of the second s state (note that the scales in the upper and lower panels are different), except that the former vanishes at the origin. ",

Therefore the energy of a resonant state is only weakly affected by the variation of the size of the spherical-box. This has been shown in [24,30] as well as in the present work. Next we show the convergence of the real radial wave function with respect to the box size. The radial wave function of the p wave resonance is shown in figure 5. In order to see clearly the asymptotic behavior, the wave function $\\Psi ( r )$ is multiplied by the radial coordinate $r$ .With $\\mathcal { R }$ increasing,more nodes appear and the wave function inside the potential barrier decreases only slightly.

It is shown that in the presence of the Coulomb interaction, the spherical-box approach still works well for narrow resonances. In particular the present method can give resonance parameters in a quite high precision for very narrow resonances. The energy and width also converge reasonably fast with the box size increasing. Within the spherical-box, the real wave functions of these resonances are obtained. The localization behavior of the radial wave function is consistent with the width of a resonance. The convergence of the radial wave function with the increases of the box size is studied, which shows that the wave function of a narrow resonance is also “stable” against the changes of the box size.
