        "text": "Post-translational modification (PTM) of histones is vital for the regulation of diverse biological processes,including DNA replication,DNA repair,and maintenance of genomic stability.[1] Aberrant histone modification leads to many diseases in human.2] To reveal the role of a specific PTM in histones,it is essential to produce homogeneous recombinant protein that contains the site-specific PTM. Semisynthetic and enzyme-catalyzed methods have been developed to realize site-specific histone PTM.[3] Compared to these methods, the genetic code expansion technique has the unique advantage that unnatural amino acids (UAAs) can be directly incorporated at specific sites of a protein of interest.4] For example, threelysinePTMs( $N ^ { \\varepsilon }$ -acetyllysine (AcK), $N ^ { \\varepsilon }$ -crotonyllysine,and $N ^ { \\varepsilon }$ -methyllysine) have been successfully genetically encoded.[5] Lysine formylation is a newly discovered PTM in histones and other nuclear proteins,and itis believed to be associated with oxidative stress under pathological conditions.6] The formyl moiety can come from $3 ^ { \\prime }$ -formylphosphate residues arising from $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -oxidation of deoxyribose in DNA,caused by the enediyne neocarzinostatin.Only one methyl group shorter than $\\mathsf { A c K } , ^ { [ 7 ] }$ （204号 $N ^ { \\varepsilon }$ -formyllysine (ForK) is not only structurally similar,but also appears at the same sites of histones.This raises the question as to whether ForK and AcK have similar roles in chromatin structure modulation and gene expression.Howev er,the lack of methods to site-specifically incorporate ForK into defined sites of proteins limits our ability to probe the function ",
