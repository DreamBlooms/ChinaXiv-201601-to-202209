This study has investigated the influence of brand image, perceived service quality, beer flavor diversity, and price rationality on customers' repurchase intention， along with the mediating role of customers' satisfaction in the aforementioned relationships. The study was conducted in Wuhan, Hubei Province， used a Likert-scale questionnaire as the main body of the questionnaire. IBM SPSS STATISTICS 19 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data analysis. The results revealed the positively of brand image, perceived service quality, beer flavor diversity, and price rationality on customers' repurchase intention, along with the mediating role of customers' satisfaction in the aforementioned relationships. This study also found that brand image occupies a dominant position in the variables that promote the customers' repurchase intention in the craft beer industry. The results of study contributed to an understanding of craft beer consumption behavior. ",

The craft beer market has seen surprising growth over the past 35 years.The previous studies carried on craft beer have been focused on microbe34 ， yeast strains-8， spectrum 10,acids1,12， mycotoxins13-16， malt17, spices18 19,and brewing technology and equipment20. Compared with industrial beer, the drinking habits of craft beer change dramatically over the years21.Typical drinkers of craft beer are well-educated young people with above-average income²2.With the increase in the number of craft beer lovers, the average price of products related to craft beer sold in the market is also on the rise²3.Demographic variables have also been employed in beer research, including gender, age, education level and country²4,but few studies have investigated demographic variables specifically for craft beer consumers. In addition， the published data on the consumption behavior of craft beer in traditional brewing countries, such as Belgium and Ireland, account for less than $2 . 2 \\%$ of the research data of the beer industry²2.In recent years, a handful of scholars have explored the influence of prohibition norms, descriptive norms,attitude and behavioral control on alcohol identity， purchase intention25,and the relationship between glass shape and sales volume and beer26.But the re-purchase intention of craft beer has remained uninvolved.

Liver in $1 9 8 0 ^ { 2 7 }$ .As one of the most influential and representative models between customers' satisfaction and repurchase intention, this model has been widely used in related studies on satisfaction and repurchase intention28-31.When a customer purchases a certain product or service, he/she will compare the actual situation of the product or service with his/her relevant experience and inner expectation of the purchase. The model shows changes in customers’ satisfaction, which is an important reference for the next repurchase³2.In addition, satisfaction is directly related to customer loyalty, to which has been attached great importance by researchers in the mid-190Os.In order to keep the customers’ loyalty to the products and brand at a relatively high level, building the brand is necessary³3.Previous studies have also found that perceived price, food, service and physical environment have a positive impact on customers' satisfaction34.Brand image plays a greater role in improving consumers' intention to repurchase and in boosting word of mouth marketing than customers’ satisfaction'5.In addition, the study has revealed that the surrounding environment affects the behavior and perceived sensory characteristics of food and beverage',one of the key variables affecting customers' repurchase behavior is consumers' perceived service quality6.The combination of good product quality and fair prices usually leads to a higher level of customer engagement and affects satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Meeting customer expectations for beer tasting can lead to positive public praise and increase the likelihood of repeat purchase7. ",

However， rarely research to verify satisfaction in price rationality, perceived service quality, store atmosphere, beer flavor diversity, catering satisfaction， brand image and variables playing an mediating role in repurchase intention of craft beer. Therefore, the following research questions are brought up: Do price rationality, perceived service quality, store atmosphere, beer flavor diversity, catering satisfaction and brand image influence craft beer customers' repurchase intention?

Price rationality, perceived service quality, store atmosphere, beer flavor diversity, catering satisfaction and brand image were used as independent variables, customers’ satisfaction was used as mediating variable, and customers’ repurchase intention was used as dependent variable to explore the influencing variables of repurchase intention of craft beer customers. In order to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire, a set of reverse seting questions were used to identify whether the questionnaire was valid, so as to exclude invalid samples.After the completion of the questionnaire, a small range of pre-survey was done. A total of 32 questionnaires were issued in the pre-survey, and 32 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed. By March 5,2021，a total of 435 questionnaires have been collected. 149 invalid questionnaires were removed, and the remaining 286 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective recovery rate of $6 5 . 7 5 \\%$ .
