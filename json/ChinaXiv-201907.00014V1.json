The following thee remedial approaches were investigated for each delayed dose: A) A partial dose was administered immediately, and the regular dose was administered at the next   \nscheduled time.B) The delayed dose was administered immediately, followed by a partial dose at the next scheduled time. C) The delayed and partial doses were coadministered immediately, the next scheduled dose was skipped, and the regular dosing was resumed at the subsequent scheduled time.   \nResults: The most appropriate remedial regimen was that with the shortest deviation time from the therapeutic window. The effect of nonadherence on PK was dependent on the delay duration and daily dose,and the recommended remedial dose was related to the delay duration and concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Remedial dosing strategies A and B were almost equivalent, whereas C showed a larger PK deviation time. If one dose was missed, double doses were not recommended for the next scheduled time. Significance: Simulations provide quantitative insight into the remedial regimens for nonadherence patients and clinicians should select the optimal regimen based on the status of patients. ",

Adherence to the regimen is an important issue in the control of seizures2;3. Delayed or missed doses often occur in the treatment of patients with epilepsy4. It has been reported that approximately $30 \\% { - } 5 0 \\%$ of patients with epilepsy are non-adherent to their   \nprescribed AED therapies and more than $70 \\%$ of respondents reported AED dose omisions5-7. This nonadherence can lead to sub-therapeutic drug concentrations and increase the risk of seizures5. Inappropriate over-remedial doses may lead to clinical toxicity, with effects including change or loss of consciousness and fainting $^ 8 ( 8 )$ Valproic acid (VPA) is a broad spectrum AED used in the treatment of both generalized and focal seizures 9-1.It is also used incombination with otherAEDs in patients with multiple seizure types. As required by the US Food and Drug   \nAdministration (FDA), the package insert of VPA recommends that “If a dose is missed,it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose\"8(8). However, no clear remedial dose regimen is provided for the missed dose. Moreover, no comprehensive evaluation of the effect of nonadherence and the corresponding remedial dosing regimens has been performed.   \nMonte Carlo simulation based on population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models provides the most appropriate means to investigate the effect of delayed or missed doses12-14.Tis methodis widelyaceptedforthedevelopmentoftreatmentprotocos, avoiding unnecessary clinical studies.

The latter can be defined as the concentration (or range of concentrations) that has been empirically found to produce the optimal response in the individual patient (i.e., complete seizure control without undesired effects or if that goal is not achievable,the best compromise between seizure suppression and concentration-related adverse effects37).

Strategy A was more appropriate for patients who have low seizure frequency because the concentration gradually returned to the therapeutic range and these patients might have a higher risk of breakthrough seizures than other strategies.At the same time, strategy B allowed the VPA concentration to quickly return to the therapeutic range, which was more suitable for patients with epilepsy who have high seizure frequency. However, it may have caused more concentration-related adverse effects such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and emesis. Strategy C resulted in a greater fluctuation in VPA concentration than did the other two strategies and can be used only for patients who are unable to take the next planned dose as specified or with a delay time close to the next scheduled time.

Additionally, sensitivity analysis was performed on the patients who had a wide range of individual body weights and different levels of Ka, which may make the results more applicable in clinical practice. These perimeters had no significant effect on the dose recommendation when a dose was delayed or missed.   \nMoreover, the recommended remedial approaches for delayed/missed doses could be extended to other AEDs,such as carbamazepine and lamotrigine.15: 38   \nThis study has several limitations. The dose recommendation in the current study was based on the $90 \\%$ of the virtually simulated patients.Physicians should carefully consider the risk of toxicity after patients take a remedial dose in cases of   \nnonadherence, especially in paediatric and elderly patients.At the same time, this study only investigated sustained-release tablets and oral dosage forms, because of the lack of relevant PPK research.
