Aerodynamic performance ofa low solidity LPT cascade was improved by increasing blade trailing edge thickness (TET).The solidityof the LPTcascade blade can be reduced by about $12 . 5 \\%$ through increasing the TETof the blade without a significant drop in energy efficiency.For the low solidity LPT cascade, increasing the TET can decrease energy loss by $23 . 3 0 \\%$ and increase the flow turning angle by $1 . 8 6 \\%$ for Reynolds number (Re) of 25,Ooo and freestream turbulence intensities (FSTI) of $2 . 3 5 \\%$ . The flow control mechanism governing behavior around the trailing edge of an LPTcascade is also presented.The results show that appropriate TET is important for the optimal design of high-lift load LPTblade cascades.
