Association between IRGA-derived $R _ { \\mathrm { h } }$ and modelled outputs was statistically significant at the Aberystwyth site $( r = 0 . 6 4 )$ ，but not significant at the Lincolnshire site $( r = 0 . 2 9 )$ .At all SRC-Willow sites， significant association was found between modelled and measurement-derived $R _ { \\mathrm { h } }$ $( 0 . 4 4 \\leq r \\leq 0 . 7 7 )$ ; significant error was found only for the EC-derived $R _ { \\mathrm { h } }$ at the Lincolnshire site.

This measurement technique would provide continuous $R _ { \\mathrm { h } }$ measurements which would be directly comparable to the model outputs and therefore would provide a more accurate evaluation of the performance of the model.
