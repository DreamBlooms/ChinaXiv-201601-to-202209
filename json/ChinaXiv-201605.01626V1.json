Through modification of a random light field, gradient GI (GGI) can directly give the edge of an object without needing the original image.As edges of real objects are usually sparser than the original objects,the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the edge detection result will be dramatically enhanced,especially for large-area,high-transmittance objects. In this study，we experimentally perform one- and two-dimensional edge detection with a double-slit based on GI and GGI. The use of GGI improves the SNR significantly in both cases.Gray-scale objects are also studied by the use of simulation.The special advantages of GI will make the edge detection based on GGI be valuable in real applications.

        "text": "Ghost imaging (GI) is an attractive type of optical imaging that is rather different from traditional concepts.In GI,a single-pixel detector is used to detect light from the object,while a detector with spatial resolution measures the information about the source [1-3]. The image of object is reconstructed by two-order correlation of light intensities on the two detectors. In thermal light GI,if the intensity distribution of the source can be determined by calculations or predictions,then GI can be performed with only a single-pixel detector [4,5].Additionally, thermal light GI can realize lensless imaging [6,7] and has the ability to weaken the influence of disturbance in the light path [8]. Therefore,thermal light GI has been applied in many fields, such as lidar detection [9],optical coherence tomography [1O],and fluorescence imaging [11]. ",

        "text": "Edge detection, which tests the object edge consisting of a dramatic change in transmittance or reflectance of an object,is widely used in target recognition,earth observation and security check [12,13]. In most previous edge detection approaches,the original targets are imaged before the edges are extracted with certain algorithms such as differential operator and wavelets operator [14,15]. Although many improved algorithms have been proposed, it is the premise of using these techniques to obtain a clear image first [16,17]. However, in many real application occasions in which turbulence and scattering medium exist, the optical imaging is difficult to perform and then the edge detection algorithms cannot be implemented. Owing to the special properties of GI mentioned above, it can solve the problem of disturbance in the imaging optical path and will play an important advantage in edge detection. Theoretically, edge detection based on GI can be achieved with the existing edge extraction algorithms operating on the image obtained by GI. However, there is one restriction in practical applications of GI that the imaging quality is relatively poor caused by the reconstruction process [18]. If we perform edge extraction with image obtained by traditional GI, the quality of edge detection will be influenced by the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the imaging result. ",

In the existing GI protocols, the images are generally reconstructed in the original spatial domain,restricting further enhancement of the imaging quality,while realizing GI in other domains may be meaningful in real applications [23]. As for most real objects the image edges have much higher sparsity than the original images,the SNR of the edge detection will be dramatically improved if the object edge can be imaged directly without the traditional GI procedure.In this paper, we report a demonstration of gradient GI (GGI) that is achieved by modifying the intensity distribution properties of the light source and the measurement processng.Edge detection can be realized with GGI needless of retrieving the original object.

        "text": "The implementation of GGI plays an important role in the SNR enhancement of edge detection. From Eq. (1O),the SNR enhancement is related to the factor of $S _ { \\mathrm { s p a } } / S _ { \\mathrm { g r a } }$ In general, for a twodimensional object, the transparent area increases with the square of the object length,while the area of object edge is proportional to the length of the object because the edge is composed of one-dimensional lines. Therefore,for a larger object, the object area in the gradient domain $S _ { \\mathrm { g r a } }$ increases more slowly than the spatial area $S _ { \\mathrm { s p a } }$ , causing the edge detection quality to be improved more significantly.We use simulations to study the edge detection quality improvement of GGI for different object areas.The test object is shown in Fig.5(a); its size is varied from 10O to 10oO pixels in 100-pixel steps,and the spatial coherence length of the field is 1 pixel. The edge of original object is shown in Fig. 5(b).With the same measurement number of 10,000,the edge detections of objects with different areas are performed by traditional GI and GGI,and the SNRs of results are calculated.Figure 5(c) shows the SNRs of edge detections with GI and GGI as functions of object size l. SNR1 is for traditional GI with curve fitting to $\\mathrm { S N R 1 } = \\alpha / l$ ,and SNR2 is for GGI with curve fitting to $\\mathrm { S N R } 2 = \\beta \\Big / \\sqrt { l }$ ,in which $\\alpha , \\beta$ are fitting parameters. We can see that the simulation results (data points) agree very closely with the theory (dashed curves).The SNR of edge detection with GGI remains larger than that with GI, and decreases more slowly when the object size increases.Figure 5(d) plots the SNR enhancement factor (data points) versus the object size.From the curve fiting (dashed curves) the factor is proved to be proportional to the square root of l.In our experiments shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we use objects with small areas to reduce the imaging time,resulting in SNR enhancement that is not very high; however,for large objects,GGI will produce more dramatic improvements in the quality of edge detection.

The information acquisition mode of GGI brings several benefits to edge detection. First,in GGI we just detect the total intensity of light from the objects without spatial resolution,which avoids the disturbance of imaging optical path on the light intensity distribution and therefore can be used in the turbulence and scattering environments. Second,as diferential operation and wavelets transform are usually sensitive to the noise,the effect of traditional methods of edge detection is closely related to the quality of the object image [24].Noise on any one pixel of the image may induce an error in the result of the edge extraction. Although filters can be used in the image processng to suppress the noise,it will blur the edges at the same time.While in GGI,every single time of detection is a global measurement on the object. According to Eq. (7-9),the noise in the measurement result△y generates effect on the whole reconstructed image but not a local position, which will not induce serious errors in the edge detection. Therefore,the edge detection based on GGI has good robustness against the measurement noise. ",

By modifying the properties of the light source and the processing of the information measurement, GI is performed in the gradient domain and the edge of an object can be directly obtained without imaging the original object,achieving high SNR in the edge detection result. The implementation of GGI has particular advantages for large-area, high-transmitance objects.Moreover, the modification of light field provides a method to expand GI technique to other domains.As GI has the ability of lensless imaging and weakening the influence of turbulence,we believe that edge detection based on GGI will be valuable in many real applications such as earth observation and security check.
