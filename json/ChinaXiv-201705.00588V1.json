Since the SRM reaction runs at high temperatures,highly thermo-stable catalysts have to be developed for feed industry requirements.Ni-based catalysts have been considered to be apromising candidate due to their low cost and availability. However,these catalystssuffered fromfastdeactivationathigh temperatures due to sintering or particle growth and formation of inactive carbon fibres/filaments.These drawbacks become a main barrier for industrial applications.
