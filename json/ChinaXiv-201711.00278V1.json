A reason for this reluctance might partly be the lack of central preprint services for the field of neuroscience.To address this issue,we announce the launch of Preprints of the R-fMRI Network (PRN),a community funded preprint hosting service. PRN provides free-submission and free hosting of manuscripts for resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) and neuroscience related studies. Submissions will be peer viewed and receive feedback from readers and a panel of invited consultants of the R-fMRI Network.All manuscripts and feedback will be freely available online with citable permanent URL for open-access. The goal of PRN is to supplement the “peer reviewed” journal publication system - by more rapidly communicating the latest research achievements throughout the world. We hope PRN will help the field to embrace the preprint model and thus further accelerate R-fMRI and neuroscience related studies, eventually enhancing human mental health. ",

        "text": "Before submitting manuscripts to traditional journals for peer review and publication, researchers in some fields routinely distribute the manuscripts as preprints within their field. In this way, they receive early feedback,which may help in preparing articles for definitive submission as well as rapidly propagating novel ideas to their fields. The well-known central repository for preprints，arXiv (http://arXiv.org)，was founded in 1991 by Dr. Paul Ginsparg for the field of physics. It gradually expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, nonlinear science, quantitative biology,and statistics as scientists in these fields began to embrace preprints (Ginsparg,2O11).arXiv now hosts close to one million fulltext preprints (983,739 as of November 1,2014). Registered users of arXiv can submit manuscripts (multiple versions are allowed) and all users can freely browse, view and cite any articles.Although arXiv lacks rating systems or a feedback mechanism to let users recommend papers of interest to peers or to provide feedback to authors, it is still an invaluable resource for the fields it serves.

        "text": "However, researchers’ attitude toward preprints, varies depending on the field. The field of neuroscience has yet to adopt the practice of releasing preprints. Instead, neuroscientists commonly circulate their manuscripts to collaborators and colleagues for feedback before submission,but distribution is private and limited to small groups. The reason for such limited sharing might partly be the lack of central preprint services for the field. Only in 2O13 did two preprint services dedicated to biology emerge for the field of life science (Callaway， 2013；Van Noorden，2012). The two preprint services，PeerJ Preprints(https:/peerj.com/preprints/）startedbyPeerJ， Inc.andbioRxiv (http://biorxiv.org) launched by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, are providing preprint hosting services with online feedback and comment systems. It is expected that early feedback will be helpful for authors in revising and improving their articles for later peer review process of traditional journals. Furthermore,commenters can be acknowledged for their contributions in later publication. However, it is only the dawn of neuroscience preprints -- bioRxiv and PeerJ Preprints have only received 56 and 38 neuroscience papers,respectively (as of 11/1/2014,see Table 1). More efforts to facilitate adoption of the preprint model appear to be needed. ",

        "text": "A subfield of neuroscience, neuroimaging,especially that which focuses on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI)，has emerged as field which is embracing innovations such as open data sharing (e.g.，ADHD-2Oo-Consortium,2012; Biswal et al., 2010; Di Martino et al.， 2014; Hall et al., 2012; Mennes et al., 2013; Milham,2012; Mueller et al., 2005; Satterthwaite et al., 2014; Van Essen et al., 2013; Zuo et al., 2014),open software sharing (e.g., Bellec et al., 2012; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Sikka et al.,2014; Song et al.,2011; Taylor and Saad,2013; Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012; Xia et al.,2013; Yan and Zang,2010; Zang et al., 2012; Zuo and Xing，2014） and sharing of learning resources (e.g.，Training Course in fMRI (http://sitemaker.umich.edu/fmri.training.course) and The R-fMRI Course (http://rfmri.org/Course)). As a method to investigate ongoing brain activity in basic, translational and clinical neuroscience studies，R-fMRI has become an increasingly prevalent research area especially in recent years (Fornito and Bullmore,2Ol2; Fox and Raichle,2007; Kelly et al., 2012; Van Dijk et al., 2010) considering its sensitivity to characterize developmental, aging and pathological features (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007; Fair et al.，2008；Greicius,2008； Zuo et al.， 201O)，subject-friendly data collection procedures in clinical samples,and high comparability and consistency across studies and sites (ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012; Biswal et al.,2010; Mennes et al., 2013; Tomasi and Volkow, 2O12). This field has expanded exponentially, now exceeding more than 1000 studies published per year (Figure 1). Given the emerging traditions of openness in this field,and an increasing number of researchers involved, we believe that the field can benefit from a preprint service that provides peer viewing and commenting.
