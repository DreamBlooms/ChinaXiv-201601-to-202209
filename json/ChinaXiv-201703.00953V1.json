In the case of EDL TFTs,the extremely strong electrostatic coupling between the mobile ions/protons in the gate dielectric and the carriers in the channel layer is crucial for low-voltage operation [9,1O].For example, $3 . 0 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ operation of organic EDL TFTs was realized when $\\mathrm { P E O / L i C l O _ { 4 } }$ electrolyte was used as the gate dielectric [11].At the same time, this kind of ionic/electronic hybrid TFT could be used for mimicking the learning and memory functions of biological synapses [12,13].For example, Chen et al fabricated Si-based synaptic transistors by integratinga layer of $\\mathrm { R b A g _ { 4 } I _ { 5 } }$ ionic conductor and a layer of ion-doped MEH-PPV conjugated polymer into the gate dielectric.

Figure 2(c) shows the current leakage curve of the nanogranular $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ films in bias voltages from $- 1 . 5$ to $1 . 5 { \\mathrm { V } } .$ A relativelylow leakage current of ${ < } 4 . 0 \\mathrm { n A }$ was measured,which is much lower than that of ion gel dielectrics under the same conditions [24].The above results strongly indicate that the room-temperature deposited nanogranular $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ film is an electronically insulating but proton conducting solid electrolyte.In order to analyze the polarization mechanism of the proton conducting $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ film,the frequency-dependent specific capacitance of the nanogranular $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ film was tested, as shown in figure 2(d).The specific capacitance increases with decreasing frequency, and a maximum value of ${ \\sim } 6 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { F } { \\mathrm c m } ^ { - 2 }$ is obtained at $1 . 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ .The high capacitance of the $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ proton conducting filmat low frequency is attributed to the formation of a Helmholtz layer with a thickness of ${ \\sim } 1 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ at the $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } / \\mathrm { I Z O }$ interface [25]. Such large specific capacitance can provide strong capacitive coupling between the gate electrode and the IZO channel,which can greatly reduce the operation voltage of such TFTs.In order to further explain the polarization mechanism of the $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ -based proton conductor, the phase angle was measured as a function of the frequency,as shown in figure 2(d). It is well known that the phase angle of an ideal capacitor is $- 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ while it is $0 ^ { \\circ }$ for an ideal resistor. Therefore,this phase-angle curve indicates a more resistive behavior when frequency ${ > } 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { k H z }$ $( \\theta ( f ) < 4 5 ^ { \\circ } ,$ ）， whereas a more capacitive behavior when frequency $< 6 0 \\mathrm { k H z }$ $( \\theta ( f ) > 4 5 ^ { \\circ } )$ .In the low-frequency region ( $\\zeta < 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { k H z }$ for $- \\theta ( f ) > 4 5 ^ { \\circ } )$ , the EDL formation is the dominant polarization mechanism.In this region, the mobile protons have enough time to migrate to the interface,which results ina larger EDL capacitance at the $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } / \\mathrm { I Z O }$ interface,whichisfavorable for low-voltage operation.

When the distance is $\\sim 5 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ，the thickness of the selfassembled channel layer is estimated to be $\\sim 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ .When the distance is reduced to $\\sim 3 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ，the thickness of the self-assembled channel layer is ${ \\sim } 1 5 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ .If the distance is too small $( < 1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } ) }$ ，the self-assembled channel gradually disappears.In our experiment, IZO channel layers are directly exposed to air ambient without surface passivation,which will result in oxygen adsorption on the channel surface. Therefore,the adsorbed oxygen can capture electron from the conduction band and result in channel surface depletion. At the same time,mobile protons in the $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ electrolyte canpartially deplete the IZO channel too.When the channel thickness( $\\left( 3 0 \\mathrm { n m } \\right)$ is larger than the total thickness of the two depletion layers,the channel is only partially depleted under zero gate bias and the device will operate in a depletion-mode. When the channel layer thickness is reduced to $1 5 \\ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ the channel layer is almost completely depleted under zero gate bias, then enhancement-mode operation can be obtained. Figure 3(a) shows the output characteristics of the device with the $1 5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ -thick IZO channel. The drain current $\\left( I _ { \\mathrm { d s } } \\right)$ versus drain voltage $( V _ { \\mathrm { d s } } )$ curves were measured at various gate voltages $( V _ { \\mathrm { g s } } )$ from O to $0 . 7 { \\mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ with $0 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ steps.This device exhibits $\\mathfrak { n }$ -type enhancement-mode characteristics.A quite high $I _ { \\mathrm { d s } }$ current of ${ \\sim } 1 3 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { A }$ is obtained at $V _ { \\mathrm { d s } } = 1 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { V }$ and $V _ { \\mathrm { g s } } = 0 . 7 \\ : \\mathrm { V }$ .Figure 3(b) shows the corresponding transfer characteristics at the fixed $V _ { \\mathrm { d s } }$ of $1 . 5 { \\mathrm { ~ V } } .$ It can be seen that the TFTs exhibit a high performance with a large current on/off ratio above $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ and a small subthreshold swing (SS) of ${ \\sim } 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V } ,$ /decade.An anticlockwise hysteresis with a small threshold voltage shift of ${ \\sim } 0 . 1 \\mathrm { v }$ is observed due to the mobile protons in the nanogranular $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ proton conductor.

        "text": "Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) is a common form of shorttermsynaptic plasticity in biological synapses and is essential to decode temporal information in auditory or visual signals. When a pre-synapse receives two spikes in rapid succession, the post-synaptic response will commonly be larger for the second than for the first spike.With decreasing inter-spike duration time,a greater post-synaptic response or a higher PPF would be obtained [31,32].The synaptic transistors proposed here could also process temporally correlated spikes and generate temporal analog logic such as PPF.Figure 6(a) shows a scheme of the EPSCs triggered by a pair of temporallycorrelated pre-synaptic spikes in our IZO-based synaptic transistor. PPF is demonstrated by applying two successive pre-synaptic spikes(1.O V, 5O ms） with an inter-spike interval, $\\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { p r e } }$ ，ranging between 10 and $2 0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } }$ .As shown in figure $6 ( \\boldsymbol { \\mathbf { b } } )$ ，the EPSC triggered by the second pre-synaptic spike is larger than the EPSC triggered by the first spike with the inter-spike duration of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } }$ .ThePPF index,defined as the ratio of amplitudes between the second EPSC and the first EPSC,is plotted versus $\\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { p r e } }$ in figure 6(c). The PPF index reaches a maximum value of ${ \\sim } 1 9 5 \\%$ at $\\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { p r e } } = 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ and gradually decreases with increasing $\\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { p r e } }$ .After the first spike,the protons within the nanogranular $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ electrolyte Would drift back to their equilibrium positions due to the concentration gradient.If the inter-spike interval is very short, the protons triggered by the first spike will still partially reside near the IZO channel. Thus, the protons triggered by the second spike are augmented by the residual protons triggered by the first spike.The longer $\\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { p r e } }$ would induce fewer residual protons near the IZO channel and result in a lower value of A2/A1. Thus,PPF and short-term synaptic plasticity are mimicked in our IZO synaptic transistors. ",

        "text": "Although two-terminal memristors have been reported to be good candidates for artificial synapse applications, two-terminal memristors shows similarities to ‘point-to-point' connected synapses.In two-terminal memristor devices, the conductance between the top and bottom electrodes is usually used as the synaptic weight. Three-terminal transistors show similarities to‘point-to-line’ connected dendrite synapses. These kinds of devices are also interesting for artificial synapses where the channel conductance is regarded as the synaptic weight.In a synaptic transistor, the gate is used as the pre-synaptic input terminal while the channel layer is regarded as the post-synaptic output terminal in a neuron's dendrite. For the construction of an artificial synapse network with many different pre-synaptic inputs,a three-terminal synaptic transistor with multiple gates is much better. Therefore our synaptic transistors are interesting for the realization of future neuromorphic computing systems. ",
