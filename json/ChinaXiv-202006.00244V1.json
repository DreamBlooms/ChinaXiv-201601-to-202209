However, the relationship between plant community diversity and ecological stoichiometry has not yet been fully researched in arid and semi-arid regions. Ecological stoichiometry and plant community diversity indices of eighteen communities in the upper reaches of Tarim River, northwestern China,were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance in 2O16.The correlation between ecological stoichiometry and plant community diversity was assessed by redundancy analysis (RDA). Results indicated that the Margalef index was significantly correlated with carbon (C） and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ concentrations, the Simpson index and Shannon-Weaner index were significantly correlated with plant C concentration,and the Pielou index was significantly correlated with plant C and $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ concentrations. Moreover, C:N and C:P ratios had significant impacts on plant community diversity. Our results highlight the importance of ecological stoichiometry in driving plant community diversity in the upper reaches of Tarim River, northwestern China. ",

At present, ecological stoichiometry has been applied to the molecules, cells, individuals,communities and ecosystems (Elser et al., 2OO7; Elser et al.,201O; Yan et al., 2016). It has also been used to estimate the nutrient limitation of plants and to reveal the nutrient utilization strategies of plants (Sterner and Elser,2O02). The lack of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrients can limit plant growth (Sperfeld et al.,2O17; Zeng et al.,2017), thus decreasing plant community diversity (Conti and Diaz, 2O13). Plant community diversity is important for maintaining the stability and process of an ecosystem (Tilman et al.,1996; Naeem and Li,1997; Yachi and Loreau,1999; Snyder et al.,2006; Haddad et al.,2011; Pelini et al.,2014; Vilela et al.,2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Bustos-Segura et al.,2017; Saitta et al., 2018). Therefore, using ecological stoichiometry method to study plant communities and their relationships can help to reveal the ecological strategies of plants in specific environments，and is of great significance to the material circulation and energy balance in a community.

However, litle research was carred out on the desert ecosystem (Conti and Diaz,2O13). In addition, the study of ecological stoichiometry was always carried out at individual level not at the community level. (Halvorson et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2017) ",

Plant communities in the upper reaches of Tarim River located in an especially fragile ecological zone in northwestern China (Gong et al.,2O16),yet not much is known about these plant communities. Hence,exploring the impact of ecological stoichiometry on plant community diversity provides a scientific basis for guiding vegetation restoration of the desert ecosystem in the upper reaches of Tarim River. Here,we hypothesis that (1） characteristics of ecological stoichiometry will afect the distribution of plants,thereby affecting plant community diversity of the upper reaches of Tarim River; and (2) distance from the Tarim River will affect the characteristics of ecological stoichiometry and plant community diversity indices，but relationship between ecological stoichiometric and plant community diversity was not affected.

This community has the largest number of Phragmites spp. that is a unique xerophilous plant (Tuboi and Hussain, 2O18). Because T1 zone is the closest to the water source in the three sampled zones,a large number of Phragmites spp. grows in there. With the rapid growth of this species,the vascular bundles increase in the leaves and photosynthesis is enhanced， thereby leading to the effective accumulation of organic mater in the leaves (Behera et al.,2Ol2). The highest N concentrations were observed in the species of Alhagi sparsifolia Shap. that dominates T23 community.

The N:P ratio are higher than 16 in some communities, indicating that these communities were strongly P-limited (Yan et al.,2O15; Yu et al.,2O17b),and other communities that the N:P ratio are less than 14, were more limited by N (Plach et al., 2017). However, factors affecting plant N:P ratio are complex and comprehensive (Elser et al.,2007). The nutrient restriction in different communities are controlled by many factors，and the interaction between plant elements makes N:P ratio more complicated (Yan et al., 2O15; Plach et al., 2017).Hence, the mechanism behind it needs further research.

However, other communities with poor anti-interference abilities have higher self-healing abilities after habitat destruction. The results indicate that dominant species can play a leading role in maintaining community structure and ecological function (Zhang et al., 2017). The values of the Shannon-Wiener index of the T11 and T16 communities in T1 zone were high, indicating that the structure and composition of these communities are more complicated. In contrast, the T31 community in T3 zone had a low value of the Shannon-Wiener index, pointing to a simpler community structure. The T1l and T16 communities in T1 zone are located closer to the Tarim River and are not subjected to drought stress. The water resources are relatively abundant and thus more plant species could survive in there (Merritt et al., 2OlO). In contrast, the T31 community in T3 zone is far from the river,and only a handful of desert species that overcome drought stress could survive in there. The values of Margalef index and Pielou index in the plant communities of Tl zone were higher than those of the other zones,reflecting the high richness of species and abundant distribution of species in T1 zone. This result may be attributed to the fact that the plant communities in T1 zone are closest to the water source and have plenty of water that supports more species to survive and grow in there (Merritt et al., 2010).

        "text": "The results supported our hypothesis that ecological stoichiometry and plant community diversity were related. It is possible that the ecological stoichiometry is important in driving plant community diversity.Previous studies have found that C is the main element for plant,and compared with other nutrient, its concentration is high and stable (Heyburn et al.,2O17), but C is not a key element that limits plant growth (Makino et al.,2OO3; Heyburn et al.,2OO7).The result showed no significant correlation between plant community diversity and C concentration was found, further confirming this latter view. In our study, $\\mathbf { N }$ and $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ concentrations were important to plant community diversity indices that showed a significant correlation with $\\mathbf { N }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ concentrations. Study has showed that changes in $\\mathbf { N }$ and $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ concentrations had an impact on plant community diversity (Zhao et al.，2O1O). Both the increase and decrease of $\\mathbf { N }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ concentrations will affect the growth rate of plants,thus changing plant community diversity (Frenken et al.， 2017). The sequence of importance of ecological stoichiometry on plant community diversity shows that C:N and C:P ratios also had significant impacts except for $\\mathrm { \\bf N }$ concentration. The C:N and C:P ratios provide insight into plant's ability to absorb nutrients and assimilate C (Bell et al.,2O18),to a certain extent, they can also reflect the nutritional efficiency of plant (Liu et al., 2O1O). Plant communities have different C sequestration efficiencies,while C accumulation efficiency and storage capacities are associated with $\\mathbf { N }$ and $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ supplies that limit plant growth. Ultimately, ecological stoichiometry and plant community diversity appeared to be closely linked (Castellanos et al., 2018). ",

However, the plant community diversity index showed an opposite pattern when the distance to the riparian continues increase.What's more,RDA showed that $\\mathbf { N }$ concentration was a key factor affecting plant community diversity in the Tarim River. In conclusion,under extreme environment of lacking nutrients and water, desert plants in Tarim River have formed special characteristics of ecological stoichiometry to maintain plant community diversity.
