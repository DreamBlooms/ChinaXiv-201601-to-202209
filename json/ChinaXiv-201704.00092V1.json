        "text": "A novel positively charged loose nanofiltration (NF) membrane was fabricated feasibly by UV-induced photografting polymerization of diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride(DADMAC)on Polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane.A possible reaction mechanism was proposed that a linear chain structure and/or pyrrolelike five-membered nitrogen heterocycles structure on the side chain were grafted to form the active barrier layer.NF membrane demonstrated a looser average pore size of $8 . 6  { \\mathrm { n m } }$ and positive charges surface. Owing to the nanoscale ultrathin nanoscale barrer layer and the combination of Donnan exclusion and steric hindrance,NF membrane exhibited good hydrophilicity,a high pure flux of $6 0 \\mathrm { L } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { h }$ $( 0 . 5 \\mathrm { M P a } )$ ,a good salt rejection to $\\mathsf { M g } ^ { 2 + } ( 9 0 . 8 \\% ) , \\mathsf { A l } ^ { 3 + } ( 9 4 . 0 \\% ) , \\mathsf { C a } ^ { 2 + } ( 9 1 . 5 \\% )$ ,and a high dye rejection to methylene blue $( 9 9 . 4 \\% )$ and congo red $( 1 0 0 . 0 \\% )$ respectively.

        "text": "Upto date,NF membranes were mainly fabricated by two methods: one step phase separation [1-3] and multi step modification on base ultrafiltration membrane [4-7].The former direct phase separation method could be used to prepare integrally skinned asymmetric nanofiltration membranes of polyetherimide, polyacrylonitrile and polyethersulfone etc.The latter usually includes two steps,the base ultrafiltration membrane was first prepared by phase inversion [8-11],and then the functional active layerfor nanoscacle selective permeation was constructed on the base membrane via diverse approaches,which includes dipcoating[12,13]，interfacial polymerization [4,7,14,15]，surface cross-linking [16-18] and UV-induced grafting polymerization [6,19,2O] etc.A soluble poly(ether ether sulfone)(PEEK) ionomer with pendant quaternary ammonium groups (QAPEEK) was dipcoated on Polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane to form a positive charged nanofiltration membrane [12,13],however the van derWaals forces between compound and the base membrane cannot guarantee the long term stability of nanofiltration performances in the running process.In terms of interfacial polymerization and cross-linking,trimesoyl chloride(TMC) and aliphatic amines or triethanolamine are usually adapted to form the thin barrier film,and the reaction kinetics of the monomer type and concentration, the polymerization time and temperature are main factors to determine the performances of nanofiltration membrane.UV-induced grafting polymerization exhibited advantages of feasible operation and controllable reaction;UV irradiation initiated the formation of free radicals on Polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes and covalent bonding of vinyl monomers to form the firm selective barrier layer.Various monomers with positive charges,negative charges orhydrophilicity can endow the nanofiltration membrane with desired properties.The summary ofNF membranes performances mentioned above from previous studieswas listed in Table 1.Most NF membranes are either neutral or negative in aqueous environment due to the materials natural properties.However,positively charged membranesare highly demanded in current applications e.g. the multi valent cations removing from water,recovery of valuable cationic macromolecules in the bioprocess and pharmaceutical industries,heavy metal or dyes removing from effluents. To alleviate the fouling of NF membrane by ions or organic matters, it is necessary to endow the current membrane with certain hydrophilicity. ",

Therefore,the grafted chains bearing positive charges formed the active barrier layer on the nanofiltration membrane as shown in Fig.1(d),which will be further discussed in the following chemistryand morphologies.

From Fig.4,It can be seen that the salt rejection obviously increased from $5 8 . 9 \\%$ to $9 0 . 8 \\%$ and pure water flux decreased from $1 0 5 . 7 \\mathrm { L } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { h }$ to $5 0 . 1 \\mathrm { L } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { h }$ with decreasing the irradiation distance from 30 to $2 2 \\mathrm { c m }$ .Further decreasing the irradiation distance to $1 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ ，thesalt rejection slowly increased to $9 5 . 3 \\%$ and pure water flux gradually decreased to ${ \\bar { 3 } } 0 . 7 \\operatorname { L } / \\operatorname { m } ^ { 2 } { \\mathrm { h } } .$ As the surface UV-initiated reaction is a free radical polymerization,the grafting degree is closely related to the reaction time, monomer concentration and irradiation distance.From the analysis above,it can be seen that increasing reaction time,increasing monomer concentration,and decreasing irradiation distance generally leads to the decreasing flux and increasing rejection due to the increasing grafting degree.Meanwhile,there isan inevitable tradeoff phenomenon between flux and rejection.In this case, higher grafting degree caused the denser membrane possessing lower flux and higher rejection.In consideration of both relatively high salt rejection and pure water flux,NF-4,NF-6 and NF-7was chosen for further property and nanofiltration performance investigation after the optimization of reaction kinetics.
