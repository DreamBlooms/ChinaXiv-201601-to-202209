So,it is necessary to improve the flame retardant ability of PP.In the past several decades，researchers tried to solve this problem by introducing flame retardant element into PP via copolymerizing, grafting or blending [2-4].Adding flame retardants into PP is a common and convenient method to decrease the flammability of PP composites compared with other ways [5,6].

Chen et al.[9] used tris(2-hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate (THElC)as charring agent to modify the flame retardant property of PP.Wang et al.[10] synthesized a novel and efficient halogen-free composite flameretardantbybrucite and zinc borate,and proved its good flame retardant performance.These works promote the development of IFR technology greatly.However，developing a novel IFR usually needs long time; introducing catalysts or synergists into commercial APP/PER system is a simple and convenient method.Based on the mechanism of IFR: APP would react with PER to form esters, and then turn into char at high temperature during combustion [11-16].The rate ofesterification,charformationandchar quantity are the most important factors for improving flame retardancy. Many catalysts or synergists which promote the esterification were chosen to modify the flame retardancy of APP/PER in PP, such as metallc oxide, metallc salt and solid acid [17-20]. The results showed that these additives increase the flame retardancy ofPP/APP/PER in a certain extent. However, the development of flame retardant technology has no end.More efficient catalysts or synergists need to be found to improve the flame efficiency of IFR in PP and to meet the requirements of new rules and technologies.

The char layers protect the samples as a barrier, slow down the heat release and reduce the THR of composites. ",

Itis the combination of good char quality,enough char residue and high RCF induced by CoW that results in the high flame retardant efficiency ofPP/IFR composites. ",
