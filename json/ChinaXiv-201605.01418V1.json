Amphiphilic LDMP copolymercould also self-assembly form micelles with core-shell structure under water condition. The lipophilic CUR should be encapsulated into inner core by way of intermolecular hydrophobic interactions of CUR with PCL, and the drug was dissolved in water under hydration of PEG outer shell in aqueous medium (Letchford et al.，2008). Consequently，thestrongerintermolecularinteractions between the longer PCL block chain and lipophilic CUR might result in the higher DL and EE of CUR in LDMP. However, further increase of the PCL chain length might reduce water-solubility of the copolymer,resulting in the lower encapsulation of CUR.The LDMP-2 was selected for the further research according to its higher DL,EE and smaller mean particle diameter.

        "text": "It is necessary for dosage form design that a drug can be easily discharged from drug-loaded copolymeric micelles because a limited release will hinder the drug's availability and then lead to reduction of its curative effect. Therefore, dynamic membrane dialysis method was adopted to investigate the release behavior of CUR from LDMP micelles. On account of the lower dissolvability of CUR in aqueous medium (Zhang et al.，2O1Oa)，a co-solvent of ethanolphysical saline solution (4O:6O,V/V) was used as the dialysis medium to provide a sink condition.The in vitro release behaviors of CUR control solution and CUR micelles in $4 0 \\%$ (V/V) of ethanol saline solution are presented in Figure 8. The release results demonstrated that the release of CUR from control solution through dialysis membrane was much faster, $8 7 . 5 4 \\%$ of CUR was released in $2 0 \\mathrm { h }$ .In contrast,only ${ \\sim } 6 4 . 6 6 \\%$ of CUR was released from CUR micelles within $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ .Subsequently，the release rate became smaller and smaller,showing a sustained-release property and the accumulative release percentage at $6 0 \\mathrm { h }$ was ${ \\sim } 8 0 . 9 1 \\%$ ： ",

The best fitted release kinetics model for LDMP micelles was the Makoid-Banakar model with Rabjusted=0.9984 (Table2), because its Akaike information criterion(AIC) value was the lowest and model selection criteria (MSC)value was the largest among these release models.These finding suggested that the release of CUR from micelleswas mainly controlled by diffusion and polymer material erosion(Sanna et al., 2011).

But it was shown that the anticancer activity effect of CUR micelles was not significantly different from free CUR.The possible reason might be that CUR was encapsulated into the copolymer to form micelles which raised cell ingestion of CUR micelles,but the slower release of drug from micelles Would maintain CUR in a lower concentration than that of free CUR in these cells(Costa & Sousa Lobo,2OO1).The release of CUR from micelleswas very slow in the first $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ resulting in no cytotoxicity.During subsequent $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ ，the release amount of CUR was obviously increased,leading to its accumulation and anticancer activity enhancement.
