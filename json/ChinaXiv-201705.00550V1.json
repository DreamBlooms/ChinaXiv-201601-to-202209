        "text": "Water scarcity has increasingly become a global challenge to human activities,industrial and agricultural development due to the shortage of freshwater [1].Therefore,the development of renewable freshwater resources such as seawater desalination plays an important role in resolving the future water supply.Indeed,seawater desalination is expected to offer an unlimited and steady supply of high-quality water without impairing natural freshwater ecosystems [2-4].In the past half century,many technologies such as multistage flash distillation (MSFD) and reverse osmosis(RO),have been developed for seawater desalination [5]. Comparing with the thermally-based MSFD,the membrane-based RO is considered to be the most promising alternative because of its low energy consumption [6,7].However,the present polymeric RO membranes often suffer from biofouling,oxidation, metal oxide fouling,abrasion and mineral scaling, thus usually resulting ina low rejection and low stability[8,9]. Inorganic membranes are expected to break through these material-based limitations for desalination due to their uniform pore structure and high thermal and chemical stability[1O-2O].Especially,zeolite MFI(Mobil Five） membranes, including Al-free silicalite-1and its Al-containinganalog ZSM-5(Zeolite Socony Mobil Five),have been widely examined for desalination [10-14].However,it should be noted that the thermal burning of organic templates used in the synthesis of zeolite MFI membranes may result in the formation of cracks [21,22],leading to poor reproducibility of membrane preparation.It is highly desired, therefore,to develop novel molecular sieving membranes that can be facilely prepared and activated,and thus effectivelyused forseawaterdesalination.

In the past five years,a series of ZIF membranes have been prepared for gas separation [29-4O]. To the best of our knowledge,however,no studies on ZIF membranes have been reported for seawater desalination. ",

Recently,pervaporation is also recommended to be a promising technique for seawater desalination due to its low energy consumption and ease of operation [13,16,17].In the present work,we make the first attempt to evaluate molecular sieve ZIF-8 (one of the most promising MOF structures because of its outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability) membranes for seawater desalination by pervaporation. ZIF-8 shows a permanent microporosity with narrow pores size (about $0 . 3 4 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ ）[27],which is just between the size of water molecules ( $\\mathrm { . 0 . 2 6 \\ n m } ^ { \\cdot }$ )and hydrated ions(e.g. $\\mathrm { N a } ^ { + } 0 . 7 2 \\ : \\mathrm { n m } ,$ 号 $\\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ $0 . 6 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ $\\mathsf { C a } ^ { 2 + } 0 . 8 2 \\mathrm { n m }$ $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + } 0 . 8 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ $\\mathsf { C l } ^ { - } 0 . 6 6 \\mathsf { n m }$ ,Table1).Therefore, it can be expected that ZIF-8 membranes could show high water flux and high salt rejection in seawater desalination because of ionic sieving (Fig. S1).

The framework atoms were considered to be rigid,and the SETTLE algo rithm [46],was used to maintain the geometry of water.Temperature was controlled by the velocity-rescaled Berendsen thermostat witharelaxation time of O.1 ps [47].The LJ interactions were evaluated witha cutoff of $1 4 \\mathring { \\mathsf { A } }$ and the Coulombic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald method with a grid spacing of $1 . 2 \\mathring { \\mathsf { A } }$ and a fourth-order interpolation.The equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 2 fs by the leapfrog algorithm.The simulation duration was 18 ns and the trajectory was saved every 4 ps.Gromacs v4.5.3 package was used for the MD simulation and an in-house code was developed to analyze water flux through the ZIF-8 membrane [48].
