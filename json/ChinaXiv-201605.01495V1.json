Based on the current thinking that the $\\beta$ -hairpin is involved in membrane insertion,itis envisioned that upon proteinase activation, the C-terminal tail would be removed and the strong interactions it provided in stabilizing the dimer would be lost,which would disrupt the dimer and untether the glycine-rich loop.Once the glycine-rich loop acquires adequate flexibility,this frontend ismostlikelyto leadtheamphipathic ${ \\mathfrak { \\beta } }$ hairpin to stretch out.As the smallest amino acid,glycine has greater conformational freedom than other amino acids due to its unique dihedral angles [27].So that,in the membrane binding or transmembrane process,it can provide flexible conformational change on the backbone and favor hydrophobic or hydrophilic environment. Particularly,during oligomerization,the aggregated glycine-rich loops from each monomers may gain enhanced conformational flexibility than other amino acids,which will subsequently contribute to the overall hydrophobic features of transmembrane $\\beta$ -barrel and guides the amphipathic ${ \\mathfrak { \\beta } }$ -hairpins penetrating through the lipid bilayer.
