To visualize the interfacial dipole upon the deposition of TBTainterlayer,the surface potentials of active film with MeOH treatment and TBT-a interlayer were probed by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) measurements.43-45 As shown in Fig. 3, the potential of PTB7 : $\\mathbf { P C } _ { 7 1 } \\mathbf { B M }$ filmwith TBT-a interlayer was $4 2 7 \\mathrm { m V }$ ,which was about $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ more positive than that of PTB7 : $\\mathbf { P C } _ { 7 1 } \\mathbf { B M }$ film treated by MeOH. Since the surface potential was an extremely sensitive indicator of surface including surface reconstruction and chemical composition,43 the $\\mathrm { 5 0 ~ m V }$ positive shifts of the surface potential upon the deposition of TBT-a indicated that anionic TBT-a induced a microscopic electric dipole moment.45 The direction of this dipole moment was aligned with the built-in potential,which was identical to that induced by amino-based interfacial materials.Thus,the incorporation of TBT-a exerted an additional electrical field at the interface between active layer and Al cathode,resulting in an increasement of $V _ { \\mathrm { o c } }$ .44 ",
