For the first time, the author has calculated the real-time evolution of the electron clouds of transition metal ions in BaFe2As2 under excitations by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). There are different modes of fluctuations. The characteristic frequencies are 150 meV, 160 meV, $2 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m e V } ;$ and $2 0 0 { \\mathrm { ~ m e V } } ;$ ，respectively, for the modes the author observed. The results are unexpected, because the general view is that the change of the electron density is very quick,and the frequency is much higher than the lattice vibration. The frequencies the author obtained are close to that of the lattice vibration in conventional superconductors at normal and high pressures, indicating the orbital (or electron cloud） fluctuation can by the electron pairing medium.
