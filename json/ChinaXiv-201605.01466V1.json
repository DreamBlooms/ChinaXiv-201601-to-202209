        "text": "The fatty alk(a/e)ne biosynthesis pathway found in cyanobacteria gained tremendous attention in recent years asa promising alternative approach for biofuel production.Cyanobacterialaldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (cADO)，which catalyzes the conversion of $\\mathsf { c } _ { \\mathsf { n } }$ fatty aldehyde to its corresponding $\\pmb { C } _ { \\mathfrak { n } - 1 }$ alk(a/e)ne, is a key enzyme in that pathway. Due to its low activity,alk(a/e)ne production by cADO is an inefficient process. Previous biochemical and structural investigations of cADO have provided some information on its catalytic reaction. However, the details of its catalytic processes remain unclear. Here we report five crystal structures of cADO from the Synechococcus elongates strain PCC7942 in both its iron-free and iron-bound forms, representing different states during its catalytic process. Structural comparisons and functional enzyme assays indicate that Glu144, one of the iron-coordinating residues,plays a vital role in the catalytic reaction of cADO.Moreover, the helix where Glu144 resides exhibits two distinct conformations that correlates with the different binding states of the di-iron center in cADO structures. Therefore， our results provide a structural explanation for the highly labile feature of cADO di-iron center, which we proposed to be related to its low enzymatic activity. On the basis of our structural and biochemical data,a possible catalytic process of cADO was proposed, which could aid the design of cADO with improved activity. ",

In this two-step pathway，AAR reduces fatty acyl-ACPs or -CoAs into their corresponding aldehydes，and subsequently the $\\mathsf { C } _ { \\mathsf { n } }$ fattyaldehydes are converted into their corresponding $C _ { n - 1 }$ alk(a/e)nes by ADO (Schirmer et al., 2010).

        "text": "Cyanobacterialaldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (cADO)belongs to the superfamily of ferritin-like di-iron proteins(Krebs et al.，2011）and contains a di-iron center (Daset al.,2011).However,metal analysis indicated that less than one fifth of the purified protein in a typical preparation contains iron (Das et al.，2011)，assuming two iron atoms per enzyme molecule,the results indicated that the ironatoms may be loosely bound to cADO.The in vitro reaction catalyzed by cADO requires both the dioxygen as co-substrate and the presence of a reducing system,which provides four electrons per turnover (Warui et al.,2011) and caneither be biological (ferredoxin,ferredoxinreductase, and NADPH; Fd/FR/N) (Schirmer et al.,2010;Warui et al., 2011)or chemical (phenazine methosulfate and NADH; P/N) (Das et al., 2011). It was proposed that the incorporation of ${ \\sf O } _ { 2 }$ into the reduced cofactor generates an iron-peroxo species thatattacks the substratealdehyde to forma hemiacetal and followed by the scission of its $\\mathsf { C } _ { 1 } \\mathsf { - C } _ { 2 }$ bond (Li et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011). The ensuing product of the reaction is a $C _ { n - 1 }$ alkane (Li et al.,2011),and the ${ \\mathsf C } _ { 1 }$ -derived co-product was demonstrated to be formate (Warui et al.,2011).Isotope-tracer assay revealed that the oxygen atom in the product formate originates from the co-substrate ${ \\sf O } _ { 2 }$ (Li et al., 2012). Recent reports suggested that cADO also catalyzes the incorporation of an oxygen atom from ${ \\sf O } _ { 2 }$ into its alkane product for $\\mathsf { C } _ { 9 - 1 0 }$ aldehyde substrates,which yields both $C _ { n - 1 }$ alcohol and aldehyde products,implying a function for cADO in oxygenation,in addition to deformylation (Aukema et al., 2013; Das et al., 2014). An intriguing feature of cADO is its lowin vitro activity (Das et al.,2011; Eser et al.,2012；Li et al.,2011)，with only 3-5 turnovers (Andre et al.，2013; Warui et al.，2011).Andre et al. reported that cADO is reversibly inhibited by the side product ${ \\sf H } _ { 2 } { \\sf O } _ { 2 }$ ,and its inhibition can be relieved by adding catalase in enzyme assays (Andre et al.,2013). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the output of ${ \\sf H } _ { 2 } { \\sf O } _ { 2 }$ can be reduced by over $30 \\%$ in the presence of a cognate biological reducing system Fd/FR/N (Zhang et al., 2013). In addition,when cADO was fused with cognate FR and Fd inaspecific order,it displayeda 3-fold increase in activity relative to native cADO (Wang et al., 2014). ",

Structures showed that PmADO adopted an α-helical folding，with two ironatoms coordinated by histidines and carboxylate ligands (Khara et al.，2013；Schirmer et al.，2010). A long-chain ligand，which was subsequently identified as a mixture of fatty acid molecules (Khara et al.,2013),was observed in the vicinity of the di-iron center in these structures (Khara et al., 2013).This pocket accommodating fatty acid molecules were suggested to be the substrate channel.However, due to the structural difference between fatty acid and the real substrate fattyaldehyde,the interaction between ADO and the substrate remains elusive.In addition，their structural resemblance indicated that they may represent one similar state of the reaction process,thus structures of cADO at different dynamic stages during its reaction cycle will be of great help for understanding its detailed catalytic process.

A $\\mathsf { L } _ { \\mathsf { o x } }$ ligand closelyresemblingafattyacidmoleculewasbuiltaccording to the electron density observed within this structure (Fig.2A), which is nearly identical to the previously solved structure of PmADO (PDB code 2OC5). In the WT-HP structure, the helix conformation of H5 was restored,and the two coordinating residues His63 and His147 approach the active site and ligate the Fe1 and Fe2 atoms,respectively.The water molecule that bridges the two iron atoms in the F86YF87Y structure moves towards Fe1 and is not coordinated with Fe2 in the WT-HP structure.The two iron ions are bridged by one carboxylate ligand E60, the $\\mathsf { L } _ { \\mathsf { o x } }$ ligand and an oxo group. Both iron atoms show saturated coordination with an octahedral geometry (Fig. 5D and Table 3).The higher coordination numbers of di-iron center,together with the fact that the crystal was obtained after being treated with strong oxidizer ${ \\sf H } _ { 2 } { \\sf O } _ { 2 }$ ,lead to the speculation that the WT-HP structure represents an oxidized form of ADO.Furthermore，the coordination mode of two iron atoms in WT-HP structure shows a similar pattern to that observed for the R2 protein of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR-R2),in which the oxo bridge and the coordinated water exist at the di-iron site in the oxidized structure，while both are absent in the reduced structure (Logan et al.，1996). The superimposition of the F86YF87Y and WT-HP structures revealed that the hole at the protein surface,which is caused by the distortion of helix H5,exposes the di-iron sites and the oxo bridge (Fig. 6C and 6D).This observation supports our hypothesis that the identified hole serves as dioxygen channel. We proposed that the $\\mathsf { L } _ { \\mathsf { o x } }$ ligand is likely to be the analog of the possible intermediate product hemiacetal, thus the WT-HP structure mayrepresent the intermediatestate in reactionof cADO, following the entering of dioxygen and its reaction with the substrate.
