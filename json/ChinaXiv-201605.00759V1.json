Consequently when AVMs and CMs develop in the anatomical site of eloquent cortex in early life, neuroplasticity may result in cortical reorganization of the functional areas,with displacement to homologous regions on the contralateral side or to the cortex around the lesion on the same hemisphere.Language function will therefore seldom be impaired [5].

So,we believe the probable reason is that the brain possesses a greater ability of plasticity in its immature than in its mature stage.Second, duration of illness might be another reason.Unruptured AVMs are chronic diseases with a long duration of illness,whereas the course of tumors is relatively short. So,we speculate the brain has a greater ability of reorganization in the setting of a chronic disease rather than an acute disease.Moreover, the histopathological differences may play a role.AVMs are characterized by massive malformed vessels,and mass effect seldom occurs unless AVMs ruptured. On the contrary, gliomas do not have the abnormal vessels like AVMs,and mass effect usually exists.We think all the above factors may result in the difference in language cortexreorganization between AVMs and gliomas.

        "text": "The authors describe an interesting retrospective fMRI analysis of surgical cases harboring an arteriovenousmalformation (AVM),a cavernous malformation(CM),ora glioma in or near the Broca area (assumed to reside in the left hemisphere) or its homologyinthe contralateral hemisphere.They conclude that AVMs more frequently cause language areareorganization than CMs or gliomas,while theyproduce aphasia less frequently. One would expect functional cerebral reorganization to occur when two conditions are met: the brain tissue responsible fora specific function should be sufficiently disturbed and sufficient neuroplasticity should be present to allow that function to relocate.The first condition is likely influenced by lesion size and should definitely be regarded as fulfilled iffunctional impairment occurs (in this case aphasia).The second conditionis likely influenced bypatient age at the time of lesion growth and by the lesion growth rate.Thus,ifalesion developsearlyand slowly, no aphasia should occur due to relocation of function.This is in close agreement with the findings for AVMs.On the other hand,if a lesion develops late and fast,aphasia may occur but will notlead to relocation of function,as the results show for gliomas.The CM results are more difficult to categorize. There were some cases with aphasia,but also some cases with relocation of language function.Perhaps some of these lesions maylead to reorganization because theydo disturb the language area ata sufficiently young age, while others just remain too smal or take too long to reach the size that will induce aphasia.
