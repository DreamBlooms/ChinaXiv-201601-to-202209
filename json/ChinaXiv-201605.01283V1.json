Moreover,caspase-12 was activated,which suggested cell apoptosis was induced by ER stress.Taken together,ourresults indicate that knockdown of ERp44 leads to cellapoptosis through the activation of ER stress.

        "text": "How ER stress induces cell apoptosis? One mechanism is that the adaptor molecule TNF-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) recruited by activated IRE1 activates apoptosis-signal-regulating kinase1 (ASK-1）resulting in active form of caspase-12 release [23].It had been also reported that activated JNK phosphorylates Bcl-2 and Bim followed by enhanced cell apoptosis.CHOP(growtharrest-and DNA-damage-inducible gene 153,GADD153)is induced bythree branchesofUPRbut PERK-eIF2-ATF4is essential.Some target genes of CHOP such as Bcl-2,GADD34,ERO1 and TRB3 have been identified.Bax and Bak,the pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family are activated by CHOP or JNK,leading to caspases activation[24]. In this study we found that the active form of caspase-3 was significantly elevated by CHOP implicating that cell apoptosis occurred due to knockdown of ERp44.This is confirmed by our further findings that knockdown of ERp44 increased in the GRP78 levels and initiated ER stress.Moreover,cleavage of caspase-12 relies on its interaction with TRAF2 in response to ER stress [23]. In our data,pro-caspase-12 protein expression diminished and cleaved caspase-12 increased in ERp44 knockdown cellsat the late period of serum starvation,which suggests that the relationship between the cell apoptosis and ER stress induced by knockdown of ERp44.Collectively,our study indicates that human ERp44 playes an important role in ER stress induced cell apoptosis.
