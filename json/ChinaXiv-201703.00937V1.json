        "text": "INTRODUCTIONPoly $\\scriptstyle \\int p$ -phenyleneterephthalamide) (PPTA) is one of the most important wholly aromatic polyamides. Because of the rigidity，symmetry，and intermolecular Hbonding of polymer chains,PPTA can be spun into highly oriented fibers with excellent thermal stability, high chemical resistance,low flammabilityand exceptional tensile strength and modulus from liquid-crystalline solution in concentrated sulfuric acid.1,2 The representative product, that is, Kevlar has been comprehensively studied and widely applied in many fields such as military,aeronautics,astronautics,and automobiles.3-6 Kevlar and other aramid fibers have been frequently employed as reinforcing materials to fabricate high performance rubber and epoxy-based composites.However, the inferior interfacial affinity toward matrices due to thesmooth surfacesandchemical inertness of fibershinders the full achievement of their potential. To overcome this disadvantage,the treatment of Kevlar fiber with chemical,7-16 plasma19andultrasoundmetosawellsdiation21 have been developed to increase surface polarity. Most of these methods could introduce reactive sites on the fiber surface and facilitate further modification，such as grafting,but tolerate severe operation conditions and damages to the fibers. Coating the reinforcing fibers with sizing agents is an alternating way to improve interface structure.22-27 de Lange and coworkers developed an “adhesion activation\"method by coating an epoxy-amine finish (digly cidyl ether of glycerol as epoxy and piperazine as amine,at a mass ratio of 9:1) onto the fiber surface,which remarkably enhanced the interfacial adhesion.22-24 Tian and coworkers introduced the epoxy group onto the aramid fiber surface by the self-polymerization of dopamine，followed by grafting epoxy functionalized silane.27 Due to the strong interaction between epoxy groups and the rubber matrix, the singlefiber pull-out tests showed that the interfacial adhesion increased by $6 2 . 5 \\%$ ",

The solutions of these four copolymers in NMP,as sizing agents,increased the surface energy,O/C ratio and roughness of aramid fibers. The copolymer composition and concentration had remarkable effects on the interfacial structure and property of epoxy-based composites.For CRPPTA-6O，the IFSS of the sized fibers increased with an increase of copolymer concentration and reached a maximum at O.5 wt $\\%$ ，which showed a $1 9 \\%$ increase of IFSS compared with the unsized AF/epoxy resin composites.Increasing the content of co-unit in the copolymer lead to a poorer IFSS.This might be attributed to thereduced chemical affinity of copolymer toward the fiber surface.The fractured surface morphological studies suggested that the failure probably lay at the sizing agent/aramid fiber interface.This work showed great potential for enhancement of interfacial adhesion between aramid surface/matrix with a simple procedure for industrial use and beinguniversal for different matrix.
