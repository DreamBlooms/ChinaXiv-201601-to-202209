Engineered cyanobacteria have been enabled to produce industry-relevant chemicals from ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ .However, the final products from cyanobacteria have often been mixed with fermented metabolites during dark fermentation. In this study，our engineering of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 enabled continuous conversion of ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ to volatile acetone as sole product.This process occurred during lighted, aerobic culture via both ATP-driven malonyl-CoA synthesis pathway and heterologous phosphoketolase (PHK)-phosphotransacetylase (Pta) pathway. Because of strong correlations between the metabolic pathways of acetate and acetone,supplying the acetyl-CoA directly from ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ in the engineered strain, led to sole production of acetone $2 2 . 4 8 \\ m g / \\mathrm { L } \\pm 1 . 0 0 )$ without changing nutritional constraints,and without an anaerobic shift.
