A physiological test demonstrated that chlorophyll contents were more gradually reduced and that soluble sugars and proline levels elevated more sharply but malondialdehyde level stayed the same $( P < 0 . 0 5 )$ （ Plant hormone levels of abscisic acid and IAA were higher than that of WT,while gibberelins and zeatin riboside were found to be lower.The root transcriptomes were sequenced and annotated into 2011 differential expression genes (DEGs).The DEGs were categorized in 149 pathways and were found to be involved in plant hormone signalling,transcription factors,stimulus responses, phenylalanine,carbohydrate and other metabolic pathways.The modified pathways in plant hormone signalling are thought to be the main cause of greater horizontal and vertical root development,in particular.

It was introduced to China in 1877- 1878，1897 and the late 1990s (Pan and You，1994)，and adopted as an important reforestation tree species,it is now found in 27 provinces and autonomous regions (Zhang et al., 1990).The tree is planted in arid areas of China,such as Loess plateau Shaanxi,Gansu,Qinghai Provinces,Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and others where the plant showed partial abiotic stress tolerance.Water-deficit condition changed the morphology and lifespan of the species, that is the plant becomes dwarfed, andage earlier than expected.

But due to the tree morphology such as thin pinnate leaves,water loss by transpiration is high in severe drought stress condition (Yang et al., 2006).Keeping this water-deficit condition in mind, the rooting mechanism is an important factor to also be studied.The tree is shallow rooted,and most of its roots are found in the top $2 0 -$ $3 0 ~ \\mathsf { c m }$ soil layer (Zhang and Xu,2011). Plants have the potential to enhance abiotic stress tolerance in over and underground organs.Roots have long been proposed as a best choice of research to improve crop adaptation to water stress condition (Vadez,2014). The simple supposition is that more profuse root systems could absorb more moisture from surrounding soil,while vertical-extensive roots absorb water more efficiently from moist soil foundat deeper levels,in particular (Grieder etal.，2014). Various factors such as genetic (Kell,2011) and hormonal control (Santner et al.，2oo9) influence root growth and root system expansion. It is crucial to improve drought resistance in R.pseudoacacia for reclaiming up arid lands by utilizing genetic engineering techniques. ",

Four DEGs,PYR/PYL，PP2C，SnRK2 and ABF (Figure 7)act as a minimal set of DEGs for complete ABA signalling pathway (Fuji et al.，2oo9).Stochasticity in gene expression was observed in the case of PYR/PYL which acts as ABA receptors (Takeuchi et al.，2014) showed down-regulation by RT-qPCR while，upregulation byKEGG annotation. Theup-down regulation provide the flexibility needed by cells to adapt to fluctuating environments or respond to sudden stresses,and a mechanism by which population heterogeneity can be established during cellular differentiation and development (Kaern et al.，2005). ABA was up-regulated while GA level decreased in transgenic plant roots (Figure 4d,f)，as up-regulation ofDELLA actsas repressor and down-regulation of GID1 acts as receptor in GA signalling pathways (Sun，2010，2011；Ubeda-Tomas et al., 2008).The diverse changes in ABA and GA levels of transgenic black locust plant roots coincided response of plant to drought stress (Krugman,2013).

The increase in ABA and IAA contents and decrease in GA and ZR levels combined with the changes of DEGs in the roots,brought about by the insertion of the FpDREB2A gene involved in the regulation of root architecture，with horizontal and vertical stretches,in particular.Hormone signalling plays diverse and critical roles during plant development.
