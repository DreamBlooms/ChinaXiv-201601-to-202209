Type 2 diabetes (T2D) formerly referred to as non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes, results from the body's ineffective use of insulin and comprises $90 \\%$ of people who have diabetes. The growing number of deaths attributable to diabetes reflects the insufficient glycemic control achieved by past and current treatments [1]. Since 2O04，dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV） inhibitors have been demonstrated to be effective and safe compounds that control blood glucose for good patient compliance and reduced risks of hypoglycemia and other side efects [2-4]. To date, Sitagliptin1 [5-6], Vildaglipin 2[7-9], Saxagliptin 3 [10],Alogliptin 4[11] and Linagliptin 5[12] are on the market in many countries (Figure 1). ",

As a result, we generated a new series of highly potent and selective DPP-IV inhibitors,as represented by compound 21j, which has a good balance of activity, selectivity, PK properties and in vivo effcacy.
