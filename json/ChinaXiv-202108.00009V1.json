A field experiment was carried out in the salinity-affected arid area of Northwest China from 2018 to 2019 to explore the effects of nitrogen and water regulation on physiological growth,yield,water and nitrogen use eficiencies,and economic benefit of cotton. The salinity levels were 7.7 (SL) and $1 2 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { d S / m }$ (SM).Drip irrigation was used with low, medium and adequate irigation levels representing $60 \\%$ ， $80 \\%$ and $100 \\%$ of cotton crop water demand, respectively, and three nitrogen applications, i.e., 206, 275 and $3 4 3 ~ \\mathrm { k g } / \\mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ ,accounting for $7 5 \\%$ ， $100 \\%$ and $12 5 \\%$ of local $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ application, respectively were used. The multi-objective optimization based on spatial analysis showed that,at SL salinity, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use eficiency (NUE),economic benefit and yield simultaneously reached more than $8 5 \\%$ of their maxima at 379.18-398.32 mm irrigation and $2 5 6 . 6 9 - 3 0 8 . 8 7 ~ \\mathrm { k g / h m ^ { 2 } }$ . At SM salinity, WUE,yield and economic benefit simultaneously reached more than $8 5 \\%$ of their maxima when irrigation was $3 5 1 . 2 4 - 3 7 6 . 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and nitrogen application was $2 3 0 . 1 8 { - } 2 8 9 . 8 9 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ k g / h m ^ { 2 } } }$ ，NUE,yield and economic benefit simultaneously reached their maxima at $4 2 8 . 0 1 \\substack { - 3 3 7 . 7 2 \\mathrm { m m } }$ irrigation, and nitrogen application range was $2 2 2 . 1 4 { - } 2 9 3 . 9 3 \\mathrm { k g / h m ^ { 2 } }$ . The plants at SL salinity had $2 1 . 5 8 \\% - 4 6 . 5 9 \\%$ higher WUE rates, $1 4 . 9 1 \\% - 3 4 . 3 5 \\%$ higher NUE rates and $2 0 . 7 1 \\% - 3 5 . 3 4 \\%$ higher yields than those at SM salinity. The results are of great importance for the nutrient and water management in cotton field in the arid saline area. ",

Drip irigation is an important modern agricultural technology that can alleviate the shortage of soil and water resources in arid areas (Dagdelen et al., 2Oo9). In recent years, many scholars in China and elsewhere have performed much research on the regulation of water and nitrogen in cotton. Within a certain threshold range, increasing water and nitrogen application has a synergistic effect on increasing coton yield. Outside this range, yield may increase marginally or even decline (Wang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Choudhary et al., 2020). ",

He et al. (20l7） and Wang et al. (2018) found that water-nitrogen interaction in the mild saline-alkali soil had a very significant efect on the net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of cotton at each growth stage,and considered that optimal amount of nitrogen application under irrigation was $3 7 4 0 \\mathrm { \\ m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { \\bar { h } } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . Wang et al.(2013） found that a low irrigation level of $60 \\%$ of crop water demand (ETc) significantly inhibited any effect of fertilizer; however, an irrigation level of $90 \\%$ $\\mathrm { E T _ { c } }$ and nitrogen application of $2 7 8 \\mathrm { k g } / \\mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ maximized cotton seed yield, WUE and net income. Li and Zhang (2O12) studied the water-nitrogen coupling effect on cotton under different irrigation levels in the cotton area of Gansu Province,and developed a water-nitrogen model for efficient utilization of water and nitrogen and promoted cotton growth. Wang et al. (2O18) studied the coupling effect of different water and fertilizer rates on cotton seed yield, WUE,fertilizer use efficiency and economic benefit in northern Xinjiang. They found that an irrigation range of $2 1 3 { \\ - } 4 6 3 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ and fertilizer application rate $( \\mathrm { N - P } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 5 } – \\mathrm { K } )$ of $2 1 2 . 5 9 { - 3 6 7 . 5 1 }$ $\\mathrm { k g / h m } ^ { \\overline { { 2 } } }$ resulted in cotton seed yield, economic benefit and WUE simultaneously reaching $90 \\%$ of their maximum values. Wu et al. (2015) proposed an irrigation range of $3 2 8 { - } 3 9 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and a range of nitrogen application of $2 5 0 { - } 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { k g / h m ^ { 2 } }$ as the best irritation and nitrogen levels for cotton planting. Deng et al.

Cotton is a crop with a high nitrogen requirement and inappropriate nitrogen application causes overgrowth and premature senescence，which affects yield and quality. Min et al. (2014） suggested that the application of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ fertilizer $( 0 { - } 3 6 0 \\mathrm { k g / h m ^ { 2 } } )$ could alleviate salt damage, promote cotton growth and increase both cotton yield and WUE.

Xue et al.

Although many studies have investigated cotton planting and growth in saline-alkali soil (Zhang et al., 2O17), they have focused on improving soil and fertilizer use eficiencies (Du et al.，2017; Luo et al.， 2017). Studies of water-nitrogen coupling have mainly focused on the main food crops in non-salinized areas,and there are few studies on the physiological growth of cotton under salt stress in arid areas.For cotton cultivated on saline land with limited water resources, effective irigation and fertilization are very important for physiological growth， dry matter, quality， WUE， PFP (nitrogen partial factor productivity),NUE,yield and economic benefit.

This result may be caused by the coupling effect offertilizer by irrgation and transferring fertilizer by water.A higher cottn yield can be achieved by promoting the effect of water and nitrogen. Previous results revealed that cotton yield with drip irrigation increased with the increase in irrgation and fertilizer application within a certain range and then yield declined beyond a certain threshold. Overall, in the two-year study, the maximum dry matter and yield at SL and SM salinities occurred under I2 and N2 treatment. The appropriate combination of water and nitrogen is required to properly utilize the resources and a proper irrigation level could improve plant capability to utilize the applied nitrogen (Sui et al., 2017).Furthermore, the fiber length, NUE and HI also reached the maximum under I2 and N2 treatment. However, the highest N (I1） and the lowest irrigation (N3） treatment produced the lowest dry matter,boll weight and seed yield, indicating that less water supply reduces the availability of nitrogen to cotton. Tang et al. (20o5) found that less water supply lessened the yield and biomass accumulation due to stomatal closure and decreased photosynthesis.At the same time,under the highest irrigation (I3） and the lowest nitrogen (N1) treatment, the lowest WUE,NUE and micronaire values occurred because high irrigation could cause hypoxia and nutrient leaching. However, dry matter was the highest under I3 and N2 treatment in both years, which indicated that the higher irrigation improved vegetative growth and inhibited reproductive growth (Pinnamaneni et al.,2O21). Thus,suitable water and fertilizer can increase cotton yield, which is consistent with other results (Dagdelen et al.,2009). ",

High micronaire values $( > 5 . 0 )$ indicate irregular coarse fibers,while low values $( < 3 . 5 )$ show immature fibers (Kljun et al.,2Ol4). In this study, micronaire value and fiber length decreased with the increase in soil salinity. Previous study of the effect of soil salinity on final quality of cotton fiber is not consistent. Feng et al. (2O14) found that soil salinity had a significant positive correlation with micronaire value,but no significant correlation with fiber length.Latif et al. (2Ol9) found that the fiber length uniformly increased with the increase in soil salinity,but the fiber strength and maturity decreased at high salinity. Our study showed that nitrogen increased the fiber length and micronaire value at a medium dose, while fiber length and micronaire value decreased with the increase in irrigation.The formation of fiber length is determined by the rate and duration of fiber elongation. Zhao et al. (2Ol2) found that increasing nitrogen before flowering stage of cotton increased the duration of fiber elongation and maximized elongation rate. In this study, micronaire value reached the highest under Il irrigation, but the lowest under I3 irrigation. Previous studies showed that micronaire value and irrigation levels are negatively correlated (Sobrinho et al.,2O15; Pinnamaneni et al.,2O21). Higher irigation or nitrogen causes immature fiber (Leal et al., 2O2O).

The available water moves to the vicinity of cotton root system, increasing absorption eficiency and further improving the effective use of soil water (Choudhary et al., 2O20). Nitrogen application also had a great effect on PFP. PFP decreased with the increase in nitrogen application under different irrigation levels. Similar results were reported by Ye et al.

However, excessive nitrogen application did not increase. Under salt stress,the absorption and utilization of nitrogen by coton depended on the amount of water (Zhang et al.， 2013).
