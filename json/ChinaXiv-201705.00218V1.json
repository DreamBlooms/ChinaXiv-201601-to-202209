The time and space averaged energy density was used as the primary variable to form the governing diferential equations. The multilayer laminate plate is simplified to be equivalent isotropic plate using the average concept, such as the average damping loss factor and the average group speed. The global system of EFEA equations can be solved numerically and the energy density distribution within the whole system can then be obtained.The EFEA numerical results for composite laminate plate structure are validated through comparison with those of very dense conventional finite element analysis (FEA).

In other research, the EFEA formulation was applied to beams, membranes, plates and acoustic cavities[5]. While most of the research works of EFEA are related to isotropic materials, this paper aims to develop the EFEA formulation for computing the vibration response of the structures of composite laminate plates [6]. The global system of EFEA equations can be solved numerically and the energy density distribution within the entire system can be obtained with relatively small amount of mesh. Therefore, the vibration response of large scale composite laminate plate structures can be predicted in the design process efficiently. ",
