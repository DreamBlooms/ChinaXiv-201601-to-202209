Three regions separated by two magnetic transitions are clearly observed from the $m ^ { 2 }$ vS. $h / m$ curves,which are corresponding to the HM, CSL,and FFM states respectively.In very low field region,a plateform is found on $m ^ { 2 }$ vs. $h / m$ curves,which is corresponding to the HM state. With the increase of field to $\\boldsymbol { H } _ { 1 }$ ，an abrupt increase occurs to $m ^ { 2 }$ vs. $h / m$ .Considering the partial polarization of moments from HM to CSL,this abrupt increase of $m ^ { 2 }$ vs. $h / m$ is attributed to the CSL transition. When $H$ exceeds $H _ { C }$ ， the CSL is completely polarized into FFM state.In the CSL region, the state can be further distinguished by the slop ( $S$ of $m ^ { 2 }$ vS. $h / m$ The region of $S < 0$ is corresponding to CSL1 (dominant helical texture with poor FM array),and that for $S > 0$ corresponding to CLS2 (with large FM array)15. In fact, the region of CLS2 with $S < 0$ has approached the FFM phase whose $S$ is also negative on the $m ^ { 2 }$ vS. $h / m$ curve. ",

        "text": "Based on the scaling curves of the $m ^ { 2 }$ vs. $h / m$ ，the $H - T$ phase diagram with $H \\perp c$ is constructed in Fig. 4.It can be seen that $\\mathrm { C r _ { 1 / 3 } N b S _ { 2 } }$ exhibits a HM ground state below $T _ { C } \\sim 1 2 7 ~ \\mathrm { K }$ .When the field is applied, the HM state persists below $\\boldsymbol { H } _ { 1 }$ .When $H$ exceeds $\\boldsymbol { H } _ { 1 }$ ，the HM state is modulated to CSL1. Subsequently, CSL1 is changed to CSL2 state when $H > H _ { 2 }$ . Finally, the CSL2 state is polarized into FFM phase when $H$ exceeds $H _ { C }$ Two critical points can be determined on the $H - T$ phase diagram,as shown in Fig.4.In fact,in the monoaxial chiral helimagnetic system, two tricritical points have beenpredicted theoreticallybyV.Laliena et al.when the field is applied along variable directions²7.In addition, in another work,they suggests a tricritical point and a zerofield critical one in monoanixal helimagnet when field is applied along the $c$ -axis24.The zero-field critical point locates at boundary from HM to PM phases24. Therefore,in present case,one critical point corresponds to a tricrtical one,which locates at the intersection between the CSL，FFM,and PM phases( $\\sim 3 1 0$ Oe at 127 K). The other one is determined as zero-field critical point, which is situated at the boundaries between HM,CSL and PM phases ( $\\sim$ 85 Oe at 127 K). ",

        "text": "In summary， the magnetism of the single crystal $\\mathrm { C r _ { 1 / 3 } N b S _ { 2 } }$ is investigated. The magnetization displays strong magnetic anisotropy when the external field is applied parallel and perpendicularly to the $c$ -axis.The $M ( H )$ curve with $H \\perp c$ displays a loop on the boundary of the phase transition from incommensurate CSL to commensurate FFM,which suggests that the CSL phase is a metastable state. The critical exponents of $\\mathrm { C r _ { 1 / 3 } N b S _ { 2 } }$ are obtained as $\\beta = 0 . 3 7 0 ( 4 )$ ， $\\gamma = 1 . 3 8 0 ( 2 )$ ， and $\\delta = 4 . 8 5 3 ( 6 )$ ，which is close to the theoretical prediction of 3D-Heisenberg model. The critical behavior indicates the magnetic coupling is of a short-range type. Based on the scaling equation, the $H - T$ phase diagram around $T _ { C }$ is constructed,where two critical points are determined.One critical point is a tricritical one,which locates at the intersection between the CSL，FFM,and PM states.The other critical point is a zero-field critical one,which is situated at the intersection between CSL, HM and PM states.
