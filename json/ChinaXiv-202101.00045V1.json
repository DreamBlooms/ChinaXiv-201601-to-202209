        "text": "Abstract: Ping'ou hybrid hazelnut is produced by cross cultivation and is widely cultivated in northern China with good development prospects. Based on a field experiment of fertilizer eficiency, the leaf spectral reflectance and leaf potassium $( \\mathrm { K } )$ concentration were measured with different quantities of K fertilizer applied at four fruit growth stages (fruit setting stage,fruit rapid growth stage,fruit fat-change stage,and fruit near-maturity stage) of Ping'ou hybrid hazelnut in 2O19. Spectral parameters that were significantly correlated with leaf $\\mathrm { \\ K }$ concentration were selected using Pearson correlation analysis,and spectral parameter estimation models of leaf K concentration were established by employing six different modellng methods (exponential function, power function,logarithmic function,linear function,quadratic function,and cubic function).The results indicated that at the fruit seting period,leaf K concentration was significantly correlated with $D _ { y }$ (spectra slope of yellow edge), $R _ { g }$ (reflectance of the green peak position), $\\lambda _ { o }$ (red valley position), $S D _ { b }$ (blue edge area), $S D _ { r } / S D _ { b }$ (where $S D _ { r }$ represents red edge area), and $( S D _ { r } { - } S D _ { b } ) / ( S D _ { r } { + } S D _ { b } )$ $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ . There were significant correlations of leaf $\\mathrm { K }$ concentration with $D _ { y } , R _ { g } ,$ $S D _ { b } ,$ （204 $R _ { g } / R _ { o }$ (where $\\textstyle \\mathrm { \\mathrm { ~ R ~ } } _ { o }$ is the reflectance of the red valley position),and $( \\boldsymbol { { \\mathrm { R } } } _ { \\mathcal { G } } - \\boldsymbol { { \\mathrm { R } } } _ { o } ) / ( \\boldsymbol { { \\mathrm { R } } } _ { g } + \\boldsymbol { { \\mathrm { R } } } _ { o } )$ at the fruit rapid growth stage $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ . Further, significant correlations of leaf K concentration with $R _ { g } ,$ （204号 $R _ { o } ,$ RNIR/Green, and RNIR/Blue were obtained at the fruit fat-change period $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ . Finally， leaf $\\mathrm { \\Delta K }$ concentration showed significant correlations with $D _ { r } , \\mathrm { R } _ { g } , \\mathrm { R } _ { o } , S D _ { y }$ (yellow edge area),and $S D _ { r }$ at the fruit near-maturity stage $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ . Through a cubic function analysis,regression estimation model of leaf $\\mathrm { K }$ concentration with highest fitting degree $( R ^ { 2 } )$ values at the four fruit growth stages was established. The findings in this study demonstrated that it is feasible to estimate leaf $\\mathrm { K }$ concentration of Ping'ou hybrid hazelnut at the various phenological stages of fruit development by establishing regresson models between leaf K concentration and spectral parameters.

        "text": "Ping'ou hybrid hazelnut is a hybrid of Corylus that has strong adaptability and has been widely planted in China.It is mainly produced by crossbreeding between the native Corylus heterophylla from China and the exotic Corylus avellana from Europe.This hybrid hazelnut has the characteristics of cold resistance,drought resistance,and strong adaptability from C. heterophylla, alongside the characteristics of a large，thin shell and high yield from C.avellana. These characteristics give it broad prospects for production, development, and utilization (Wang et al., 2020).Potassium (K) is one of the essential mineral elements in plants (Allen and David, 2007; Izhar and Frans,2014; Nieves-Cordones et al.,2014; Lu et al.,202O); it plays an important role in the synthesis of many enzymes,proteins, starches,and cellulose. Although K does not participate in the organic composition of plants (Maathuis et al.,1999), it is an indispensable nutrient element for plant growth and development (Koch and Mengel,1974). K exists in an ionic form in plants; it has strong mobility and plays an important role in plant metabolic processes and the structure of cells and tissues (Alex,2Oo6). It has many physiological functions in the growth and development of fruit trees,flowering,and fruiting (Zhao et al.,2O14).K management is an important basis for increasing fruit yield and improving fruit quality (Wang et al., 2011).

Therefore,understanding how to accurately and quickly diagnose K deficiency in hazelnut as well as the change in K concentration in real-time,to supply K elements and recognize K demand in the external soil,and to achieve on-demand and precise fertilization is of great significance for the fertilization of Ping'ou hybrid hazelnut.

The spectral characteristics of plant leaves were mainly influenced by their physiological and biochemical properties,such as the absorption, reflection,and conduction of light waves by chloroplast pigments and water,proteins, nucleic acids,sugars,and other substances in the leaves (Thomas and Oerther, 1972; Jiao et al., 2Oo6). K element has a great influence on the above factors because of their participation in physiological and biochemical reactions and material transport in plants. The accumulated leaf K concentration in plant cell fluid is as high as $6 0 { - } 1 5 0 \\mathrm { m m o l / L }$ ,which can promote the formation of chlorophytes (Walker,1996).If the leaf K concentration is low,the epidermal cells will change,the leaf surface thickness willincrease,and the cells of palisade and sponge tissue wil shrink and rupture locally. K in plants usually exists in the form of cations (Marschner,2O11) with strong fluidity,flowing from mature tissues to young tissues for their growth and development (Mengel and Kirkby,1987) and providing an electron balance during the flow without promoting solute accumulation (Stiles and Van, 2O04). In addition, K is the basic motive force promoting the increase in plant cell volume,the fluctuation of its ions,and the change in water flux which could lead to the expansion and rapid increase of plant cell volume.Therefore,leaves of Ping'ou hybrid hazelnut increase rapidly at the fruit growth periods,and the cellstructure in the leaves also changes rapidly. Moreover, K ions are not only an important factor in the regulation of plant cell expansion by Osmotic pressure (the interaction between cell expansion and the surrounding cell wall can maintain tissue hardness） but also the main factor in maintaining the balance of cell permeability.K is involved in an important regulatory mechanism of plant $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ and water wherein stomatal movement occurs through the plasma membrane (Fisher,1968; Tallman,1972). It is also an important driving force that maintains enzyme,protein,and nucleic acid activity,and is an important element in controlling the water balance of plants (Davies and Zhang,1991).The morphology of leaf cels also has a significant influence on spectral reflectance.At different fruit growth stages,the leaf cells of Ping'ou hybrid hazelnut showed diverse shapes, sizes,and arrangements. As a result, the spectral characteristics of fruits at each fruit growth stage were different,and the parameters that were significantly correlated with leaf K concentration were different at each growth stage.

        "text": "Our results revealed that the mathematical relationship between leaf K concentration and the most effective spectral characteristic parameters established by the cubic function was of the highest precision. The most effective spectral characteristic parameters of leaf K concentration were $D _ { y } , D _ { y }$ $R _ { o }$ and $R _ { g }$ at the fruit setting stage, fruit rapid growth stage,fruit fat-change stage,and fruit near-maturity stage.Results from the RMSE and RE showed that the regression estimation model of leaf K concentration established by the cubic function had a relatively high estimation accuracy and can be used to predict leaf K concentration properly.In this study，we only established the measurement error model of spectral inversion based on the statistical relation, without considering the theoretical model, which should be further studied in the future.
