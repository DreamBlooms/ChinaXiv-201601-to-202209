        "text": "Abstract: Natural soil-forming factors such as landforms,parent materials or biota lead to high variability in soil properties.However,there is not enough research quantifying which environmental factor(s) can be the most relevant to predicting soil properties at the catchment scale in semi-arid areas. Thus, this research aims to investigate the ability of multivariate statistical analyses to distinguish which soil properties folow a clear spatial pattern conditioned by specific environmental characteristics in a semi-arid region of Iran. To achieve this goal, we digitized parent materials and landforms by recent orthophotography.Also,we extracted ten topographical atributes and five remote sensing variables from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM),respectively. These factors were contrasted for 334 soil samples (depth of $0 { - } 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { \\cdot }$ ). Cluster analysis and soil maps reveal that Cluster 1 comprises of limestones,massive limestones and mixed deposits of conglomerates with low soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay contents, and Cluster 2 is composed of soils that originated from quaternary and early quaternary parent materials such as terraces,alluvial fans,lake deposits,and marls or conglomerates that register the highest SOC content and the lowest sand and silt contents.Further,it is confirmed that soils with the highest SOC and clay contents are located in wetlands,lagoons,alluvial fans and piedmonts,while soils with the lowest SOC and clay contents are located in dissected alluvial fans,eroded hils,rock outcrops and steep hills.The results of principal component analysis using the remote sensing data and topographical attributes identify five main components, which explain $7 3 . 3 \\%$ of the total variability of soil properties. Environmental factors such as hilslope morphology and all of the remote sensing variables can largely explain SOC variability,but no significant corelation is found for soil texture and calcium carbonate equivalent contents.Therefore, we conclude that SOC can be considered as the best-predicted soil property in semi-arid regions.

Soil particle distribution is considered as a key parameter of soil quality because soil clay content controls soil cation-exchange capacity (Khaledian et al.,2017a; Sulieman et al., 2018), soil aggregate stability (Schjonning et al.，2007),and soil organic carbon preservation (Zeraatpishe and Khormali, 2O12). Moreover, soil silt is also highly related to soil erosion and is sensitive to soil particle detachment and transport processes (Ramos et al.,2Ooo).Sand and clay particles determine water content in the field and wilting point capacities, depending on the carbonate and organic carbon contents (Wang et al.,2O13).Moreover, soil organic carbon stores and mineral horizons also show a high spatial variation due to the characteristics of topography, slope gradient and curvature (Conforti et al.,2O16),and the parent material and type of land use (Sun et al.,2015).Also,based significantly on parent material,landform distributions and hydrological conditions， several scholars have demonstrated that soil calcium carbonate is accumulated, transported and distributed (Khormali et al.,2009; Karchegani et al.,2011; Wilford et al.,2015). In regard to topographic position, Stavi et al. (2oo8) concluded that calcium carbonate content in soil profiles can be lower on the north-facing hilslope than on the south-facing hillslope in the Negev region of Israel because of the lower evaporation on the north-facing hilslope. However, there is a lack of information about whether the combination of soil texture, organic carbon and carbonate calcium follows common spatial patterns in the same landscape and is conditioned by topographical variables, parent materials and/or vegetation covers.

Also, the high skewness and kurtosis values of SOC confirm the vast distribution of SOC in the study area (Rosemary et al., 2O17). Therefore,this implies the importance of knowing which kind of spatial patter can SOC follow under diferent environmental conditions,and this needs to be further clarified and determined.The high variation of SOC could also be due to the land use practices. In semi-arid areas,agricultural activities can lead to a significant increase in SOC in comparison to bare lands.In China,for example, Liao et al. (2O15) concluded that agricultural intensification increases crop productivity and crop residues, and also highly affects SOC values and carbon sequestration. The CVs for the other soil properties are more moderate,coinciding with the results in other semiarid areas with non-active land use changes. Also, the predominance of parent materials can be another driving factor as other researchers confirmed (Anderson,1988; Bruand and Tessier, 2000; Orgill et al.,2017). Therefore,the moderate variability of CCE content might be explained because all soils are formed on limestone and calcareous materials. It is important to highlight that high levels of CCE in the southwest of the study area could be affected by soil crusts, abandonment of ",

Our research question also agrees with other studies conducted in semi-arid areas. For example,based on rainfall simulations in semi-arid regions in Spain,Martinez-Hernandez et al. (2017) concluded that different parent materials define different hydrological processes at the pedon scale.Differences in parent materials such as marls, sandstones,colluvium and slates can impact on pedogenesis, but those above mentioned researches also remarked that Slp and antecedent soil moisture also play an important role.The results ofCA for landform and geology units in the present study confirm that soil properties could be classified into similar groups (clusters). However, by using the qualitative assessment, we observe that soil properties do also coincide with the IDW maps. Thus, it is confirmed that soil mapping techniques and statistical analysis have to be combined (Rodrigo-Comino et al., 2O18), but it should also be aware of the parent materials which,as found in our study, control the spatial variation of CCE contents.

However, we acknowledge that there is no assessment of prediction errors from which to produce what are known as \"bulls eyes\" or higher values near the observed location (http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/geostatisticalanalyst-toolbox/idw.htm).To solve this problem, researchers such as Kravchenko and Bullock (1999)added the number of the closest neighbouring samples using cross-validation to compare the results obtained with a different number of the closest neighbouring samples.In future research studies, it should be interesting to test different interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging, empirical Bayesian kriging or radial basis functions to observe if other soil properties do or do not coincide with SOC as the best soil property predictor using multivariate statistical analyses.

The center to the west of the study area also contains clay to clay loam soils,which confirms that soils can be more fertile and capable of being colonized by natural plants or crops.Regarding the obtained clusters,high SOC contents coincide with $\\mathbf { Q } \\mathfrak { t } 3$ and SC lithology,and Pl2, Pil and Pi4 landforms.These findings demonstrate that parent materials and landform characteristics can show well-conserved SOC levels and vegetative covers as well (Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi et al., 2016). Consequently,lithology and landforms might be considered as indicators of soil fertility. Our findings are agreement with those of Khaledian et al.

The low correlation of topographic attributes with SOC content could be ascribed to the low-relief differences (about $6 0 0 \\mathrm { m } )$ , the extreme semi-arid climate conditions and the high amounts of CCE content. Furthermore, there are slight correlations among silt, sand, El, TWI,WI, MrVBF and all of the remote sensing variables. Alijani and Sarmadian (2014) also confirmed that, in the semi-arid and arid regions in Iran, CCE is positively correlated with some topographical indices such as WI and Cur.

Cluster analysis reveals that higher SOC and clay contents are related to flat areas characterized by young quaternary deposits and alluvial fans. Conversely, masive limestones and conglomerate deposits in eroded and consolidated hills and rock outcrops with steep slopes register the lower content of SOC and fine particles,and the higher CCE content.Results of PCA show that the first five components are able to describe more than $7 3 . 3 \\%$ of the total variability in soil properties. Environmental factors such as hilllope morphology and al remote sensing variables can largely explain the variability of SOC,but no significant correlation is found for soil texture and CCE content. Therefore, we conclude that SOC can be the best-predicted soil property because it follows a specific spatial pattrn in semi-arid regions conditioned by parent material, hilllope morphology and vegetative cover.
