Myocardial function indices were measured by a left ventricular cannula via a pressure transducer connected to the polygraph in isolated Langendorffhearts and energy metabolism was measured using $\\mathrm { ^ { 3 1 } P }$ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)spectroscopy. Whole-cellpatch-clamp technique was used to record calcium inward current $( I _ { C a - L } )$ in cultured rat cardiac myocytes. Results Compared with the control hearts,the ex vivo rat hearts with $2 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ TP treatment showed significantly increased left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), maximal rise rate of LVDP $( + \\mathrm { d p } / \\mathrm { d t } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ) .$ maximal fall rate of LVDP $\\left( - \\mathrm { d p } / \\mathrm { d t } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } \\right)$ , and coronary flow (CF) $_ { ( P < 0 . 0 5 ) }$ . During both cardiac ischemia and reperfusion phase, ATP and PCr levels were elevated significantly in TP-treated hearts compared with those in the control hearts $_ { ( P < 0 . 0 5 ) }$ . In cultured rat cardiac myocytes, $I _ { C a - L }$ was remarkably decreased by TP at the doses of 2.5 and $5 . 0 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ .
