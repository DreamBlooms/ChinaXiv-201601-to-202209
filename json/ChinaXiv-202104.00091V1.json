        "text": "Abstract: Sediment transport of sand particles by wind is one of the main processs leading to desertification inarid regions, which severely impairs the ability of mankind to produce and liveby drifting sand into settlements. Optimization designs of artificial facilities have lately attracted extensive interest for human settlement systems in deserts because of their acceptable protection effect, convenience of implementation, and low material cost. However, the complexity of a settlement system poses challenges concerning finding suitable materials, artificial facilities, and optimization designs for sand deposition protection. In an effort to overcome these challenges, we propose a settlement system built with brick, solar panel,and building arrays to meet the basic needs of human setlements in arid regions while preventing wind-sand disasters. The wind flow and movement characteristics of sand particles in the brick, panel, and building arays were calculated using computational fluid dynamics and discrete phase model. The performance of three types of arrays in wind-sand flow in terms of decreasing the wind velocity and sandparticle invasion distance was evaluated. The results show that the wind velocity near the surface and the sand invasion distance were significantly decreased in the space between the brick arrays through properly selected vertical size and interspaces, indicating that the brick arrays have an impressive sand fixing and blocking performance; their effective protection distance was $3 { - } 4 \\mathrm { m }$ . The building arrays increased the nearsurface wind velocity among buildings, resulting in less deposition of sand particles. The solar panel arrays were similar to the building arrays in most cases,but the deposition of sand particles on solar panels exerted a negative effect on energy utilization efficiency. Therefore, taking the optimal configuration of the settlement system into consideration,this study concludes that (1)brick arrays, which were proven efective in preventing sand particles, must be arranged in an upwind area; (2) solar panel arrays could accelerate the wind flow, so they are best to be arranged at the place where sand particles deposited easily; and (3) building arrays present a better arrangement in downwind areas.

A tiled barrier is usually low in height because $90 \\%$ of sand grains encountering aerodynamic entrainment are located within $1 0 { - } 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ above the ground (Raupach and Lu, 2004; Mohamed and Khalaf, 2005; Jiang et al., 2017; Dun et al., 2O18). The straw checkerboard barrier is a typical tiled barrier that is widely used to prevent sand disasters along the railway in China. The study of sand transport and deposit processes in straw checkerboard barriers has been promoted by simplified theoretical analysis (Wang and Zheng， 2OO2) and air-particle two-phase flow simulation (Huang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2018). As the latest development, Xu et al. (2018) simulated the wind-sand flow around straw checkerboard barriers using a large eddy simulation and the particle-trajectory method to explore the turbulent flow characteristics, sand particle transport, and deposit processes. They found that there are huge single streamwise vortices that filled the internal space of straw checkerboard barrier cells and double spanwise vortices located in the back of the cells. ",

(2O1O) studied the shelter effect of a porous fence on wind-sand flow using a high-speed digital camera and the particle-tracking velocimetry method. These studies found that the transport rate and kinetic energy of sand can be reduced by more than $80 \\%$ and $90 \\%$ ， respectively. Inspired by this, Chen et al. (2O12) experimentally and numerically studied the shelter effect of porous sand fences,and found that deflector-porous fence with $30 \\%$ porosity, $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ height and $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ distance which between the fence and the prism model was most effective in controlling dust emission. Adopting the advantages of the two aforementioned main tiled barriers, a brick array made of clay has attracted considerable interest because of its acceptable effect, easy implementation, environmental friendliness, and low cost (Zhao et al.,2Ol2). However, despite these advantages,the development of brick arrays is mainly retarded by a lack of thorough analysis of the sand particle transport and deposit processes. ",

When the longitudinal space became $0 . 4 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ , the mean velocity decreased to a constant value and then increased slightly with increasing horizontal space (Fig. 5a). This is probably because when the air flowed through the bricks placed with a suitable longitudinal space, a series of eddies emerged within the brick arrays and a large amount of airflow energy was consumed near the surface. The mean velocity increased with the longitudinal size increased,and it decreased when the horizontal size or vertical size increased (Fig. 5b). It is clear that increasing the vertical size is a very effective method to reduce the mean velocity when the vertical size is less than $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m }$ Thus, optimizing the brick space and size may most efficiently decrease the mean velocity of the air flow.

Figure 6b shows a more complicated change in the invasion distance with changes in the brick size. The invasion distance significantly increased and then decreased with increasing vertical size. This may be explained by the fact that more airflow entered the interspaces between the bricks at the beginning and accelerated the wind flow. As the vertical size increased, the form drag of the bricks was significantly enhanced, which slowed down the velocity of airflow near the surface. Moreover, the brick arrays were better at blocking sand particles when the friction velocity was low (Fig. 6c). It is evident that an appropriate adjustment of the spaces and sizes of the bricks can significantly decrease the invasion distance normally by $3 { - } 4 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ， which was slightly longer than the invasion distance of straw checkerboard barriers (Huang et al., 2013; Bo et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020).

Most of the sand particles rapidly passed through the interspaces between solar panel arrays, suggesting that the solar panel arrays are not so good for blocking sand as brick arrays. In contrast to the brick arrays, some sand particles can move above the solar panels owing to the solar panel laying an angle,and a few particles will deposit on them. This is a typical phenomenon in the application of solar panels, which exerted a negative effect on energy generation (Farid, 2012). Compared with the majority of previous studies focused on the pollutant effect of particles (Mani and Pillai, 2010; Kazem et al., 2014; Darwish et al., 2015), our simulation results reproduced the deposition process of sand particles on solar panels, which will be helpful for improving their energy utilization efficiency.

Figure 8c shows that the mean velocity decreased when increasing the angle between the solar panels and the ground, and Figure 8d demonstrates that the mean velocity increased linearly with the increase in friction velocity. In general, the mean velocity increased in most cases because the solar panel arrays can increase the airflow entering the interspaces between the solar panels unless the horizontal space was very small, and can remove sand particles by enhancing the airflow in a specific configuration. Thus, the solar panel arrays played a flexible role in either blocking the incoming sand particles or removing the accumulation of sand particles in accordance with specific conditions. ",

Note that changes in the horizontal brick space and horizontal size between bricks had a significant influence on the sand-flux rate on the inlet owing to the complex boundary and flow field (Dun et al., 2018), and the influence decreased with the sand flow into the brick arrays. This is because the entering space for sand into brick arrays became smaller when we increased the horizontal size and decreased the horizontal space, and more sand particles resisted outside. However, the wind flow in the streamwise direction was hardly affected in these situations, and the sand fluxes and invasion distances were almost the same inside the brick arrays. Figure 11a shows that, although increasing the longitudinal space had a slight impact on the sand-flux rate on the inlet of the brick arrays, it increased the wind-flow structure in the streamwise direction inside the brick arrays, thereby enhancing the sand-flux rates and invasion distances by providing more energy to the sand particles. Figure 11b illustrates that the sand flux reached its peak when the vertical size was approximately $0 . 2 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ， indicating that this vertical size may strengthen the wind-flow structure and $0 . 1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ was a more proper vertical size for tiled barriers for sand encroachment protection (Bo et al., 2O15; Xu et al., 2018). Figure 1lc suggests that the brick arrays performed better when the sand-flux rate was reduced at a low friction velocity. Owing to the litle effect on blocking sand particles in most situations, the distributions of sand flux in solar panels and building arrays were not the primary focus of this study. ",

Both the solar panel and building arrays, however, can increase the mean velocity in most cases and block the deposition of most sand particles. Exceptionally, the solar panel arrays have a significant effect on fixing and blocking sand particles when the horizontal space is small Consequently, brick arrays must be arranged in an upwind area to stop sand-particle movement and fix them on the ground. Solar panel arrays are supposed to accelerate the wind flow where sand particles deposit easily, and building arrays should better to be arranged in downwind areas. ",
