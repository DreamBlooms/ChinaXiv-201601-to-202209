For the neutral beams based on negative ions, the most important measurements are beam uniformity, beamlet divergence and stripping losses. According to the CFETR requirement， the maximum allowed beam divergence angle and beam non-uniformity are 6 mrad and $\\pm I O \\%$ respectively. As 1D carbon tiles have large ratio between perpendicular conductivity and parallel conductivity and high stability, they can be used for beam uniformity and beamlet divergence measurement. This paper presents the investigation of the influence on the response of 1D carbon tile having the thermal characteristics and features of some dedicated diagnostics. Simulations show that it will be possible to verify experimentally whether the beam meets the requirement about the maximum allowed value. This work lays a foundation for design and application of high precision beam diagnostic targets. ",

As the key component, the 1D-CFC guarantees a ratio up to 2O of thermal conductivity along/across the fibers. Since a qualified manufacturer of suitable 1D-CFC has not been identified yet, an alternative carbon material， which has much larger ratio of thermal conductivity than that of 1D-CFC，is investigated.In this paper， the thermal performance of carbon material is analyzed using FEM and the results show that the carbon material can meet this diagnosis requirement of key beam parameter.
