        "text": "The glutarimide-containing antibiotics represent a fascinating class of natural products that exhibit a multitude of biological activities. The most famous representative of this family,cycloheximide (5),has been used for decades as an inhibitor of eukaryotic translation elongation [1-3]. Other members of this family show potent cell migration inhibition and antiviral activity [4-6], which continues to capture the attention from researchers in synthetic and biosynthetic chemistry， medicinal chemistry, and pharmacology. However, cycloheximide (5) has held back the clinical and agricultural applications due to its reproductive toxicity [7]. Identifying new analogues that offer similar activity without the toxic side-effects could provide a viable lead of therapeutic drugs or agricultural pesticides. During the course of our searching for bioactive microbial metabolites [8,9], a culture extract of Streptomyces sp. SC0581 was found to show antifungal activity against the phytopathogen Phytophthora infestans. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of three new cycloheximide congeners (Figure 1)， 2,3-dehydro- $\\alpha$ -epi-isocycloheximide (1), $( E )$ and (Z)-2,3- dehydro-anhydrocycloheximides (2 and 3), and one known but new naturally occurring cycloheximide congener, anhydroisoheximide (4)[6], together with cycloheximide (5) and isocycloheximide (6) [10]. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, theoretical conformational analysis，and ECD/TDDFT calculations. The photoinduced interconversion between 2 and 3 was observed and verified, and the possible reaction path and mechanism were proposed by theoretical computations. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for antifungal activity and cancer cell toxicity. ",

        "text": "The relative configuration of the cyclohexenone ring in 1 was assigned by analysis of the $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ NMR proton coupling constants (Table 1） and NOESY correlations. The large proton coupling constants, $J _ { \\mathrm { H - 6 / H - 5 a x } } = 1 4 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { H z }$ and $J _ { \\mathrm { H - 5 a x / H - 4 } } { = } 1 1 . 3 \\ : \\mathrm { H z }$ ， suggested that H-6 and H-4 were in pseudo-axial positions and on the same face of the cyclohexenone ring. This was further corroborated by the presence of strong NOE correlations of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 3 }$ -8 with both H-5ax and H-5eq and of H-5eq with both H-6 and H-4 in the NOESY spectrum (Figure 2). It was also in agreement with no NOE correlation being detected between H-5ax and H-6 or H-4. However, straightforward analysis of the $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ NMR and NOESY spectra was unable to assign the relative configuration of $\\textstyle \\mathrm { C } - \\alpha$ due to its location on the flexible side chain. In order to clarify the relative configuration of this chiral carbon, theoretical conformational analysis was carried out on two possible stereoisomers, $( 4 R , 6 R , \\alpha S ) - 1$ 1 and $( 4 R , 6 R , \\mathrm { { o } } R )$ -1.MMFF conformational search and subsequent geometry optimization using the DFT-D3 method at the B3LYP-D3/6- 31G(d) level followed by a higher level of energy calculations at the B3LYP-D3/def2- TZVP level afforded 14 and 11 distinctive low-energy conformers ( $\\cdot \\Delta G < 2 . 5 \\mathrm { k c a l / m o l } )$ （204号 for $( 4 R , 6 R , \\alpha S ) – 1$ and $( 4 R , 6 R , \\alpha R ) -$ 1, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information). Among the low-energy conformers of $( 4 R , 6 R , \\alpha S ) – 1$ ， those having a gauche relationship between I $\\mathrm { - \\alpha / H } { - } 6$ were found to be greatly dominant (accounting for about $9 6 \\%$ ） in the equilibrium mixture in MeOH,which could be categorized into two groups, S-1a and S-1b, based on the torsion angle of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 6 } – \\mathrm { C } _ { 6 } – \\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { a } } – \\mathrm { H } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ $( \\phi _ { \\mathrm { H - 6 / H - \\alpha } } )$ being around either $- 6 2 ^ { \\circ }$ or $+ 5 5 ^ { \\circ }$ and each group constituted about $48 \\%$ equilibrium populations. As can be seen in Figure 2,conformers in both $S .$ 1a and S-1b groups, represented by the second lowest energy minimum $S .$ -1a1 $( \\Delta G = 0 . 0 2 \\mathrm { k c a l / m o l } )$ and the global energy minimum $S .$ -1b1, respectively, matched up well with the proton coupling constant between $\\mathrm { H } { - } 6 / \\mathrm { H } { - } \\alpha$ $( J = 4 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { H z } )$ ） and the aforementioned NOESY correlations. Furthermore, conformers in group S-1a were also consistent with the diagnostic NOE interaction of $\\mathrm { H } { - } \\alpha / \\mathrm { H } { - } 5 \\mathrm { e q }$ observed in the NOESY spectrum. In turn, $( 4 R , 6 R , \\alpha R ) \\cdot$ 1 afforded the dominant conformers(accounting for about $82 \\%$ equilibrium populations), as represented by the global energy minimum $R$ -1al (Figure 2), having an anti relationship $\\left( \\phi _ { \\mathrm { H - 6 / H - a } } \\approx 1 7 4 ^ { \\circ } \\right)$ between $\\mathrm { H } { \\mathrm { - } } \\alpha / \\mathrm { H } { \\mathrm { - } } 6$ ， which were inconsistent with the small $J _ { \\mathrm { H - 6 / H - a } }$ value $( 4 . 3 \\mathrm { H z } )$ and the absence of an NOE correlation between H- $\\mathbf { \\sigma } _ { \\mathrm { { \\langle { q } / \\mathrm { { H } } } } }$ 5ax in the experimental spectra. Accordingly, the relative configuration of 1 was assigned to be $4 R ^ { * } , 6 R ^ { * } , \\alpha S ^ { * }$ . In order to determine the absolute configuration, the lowenergy conformers of both stereoisomers were subjected to TDDFT calculations of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. As shown in Figure 3, the calculated ECD spectra of $( 4 R , 6 R , \\alpha S ) -$ 1 and $( 4 R , 6 R , \\mathrm { { o } } R )$ -1 were similar to one another and both in good agreement with the measured spectrum of 1, which indicated a $R$ configuration of both C-4 and C-6 but gave no evidence for any of $\\mathbf { C } { \\cdot } \\mathbf { \\vec { a } }$ .For the latter， the $S$ configuration was assigned according to the relative configuration as deduced from above conformational analysis. Therefore, compound 1 was defined as 2,3-dehydro $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot \\mathbf { a }$ ， epi-isocycloheximide. ",

The 1D NMR spectra of the mixture contained two sets of signals in the ratio of 7:3 (according to the $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ NMR proton integral values), corresponding to two isomeric molecules 2 and 3 (Table 1), respectively. Each set of proton and carbon signals resembled those of compound 1 except for replacement of the resonances for the hydroxymethine at $\\mathbf { C } \\mathbf { - } \\mathbf { \\alpha } \\mathbf { \\alpha }$ and the aliphatic methine at C-6 in 1 by the signals for an additional trisubstituted olefin $[ \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } 6 . 5 9 \\$ ：， $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 1 3 4 . 6$ (CH),136.1 (C) in 2 and $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } ~ 5 . 8 6 \\$ ·， $\\delta \\mathrm { c l } 3 7 . 1$ (CH), 136.2 (C) in 3], suggesting a gross structure of an anhydrous derivative of 1. This was supported by the HMBC correlations of the olefinic proton H- $\\alpha$ with C-1 ( $\\mathrm { \\partial \\delta _ { \\mathcal { S } _ { C } } }$ 190.5 in 2, 192.8 in 3), C-4' ( $\\langle \\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 3 1 . 6 \\$ in 2, 33.8 in 3), and C-5 (2, $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 3 4 . 6$ in 2, 43.3 in 3). The structural difference between 2 and 3 was identified in the NOESY spectrum. The presence of a strong NOE correlation between the minor $_ { \\mathrm { H - } \\alpha }$ 1 $( \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } ~ 5 . 8 6 )$ and $\\mathrm { H } { - } 5 \\beta$ （ $( \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } ~ 2 . 7 4 )$ was observed while the same correlation between the major counterparts $[ \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } 6 . 5 9 ~ ( \\mathrm { H } \\cdot \\mathrm { a } ) .$ 2.86 (H-5β)] could not be found in the spectrum， revealing the geometrical configurations of the double bond between $\\mathrm { C } { - } 6 / \\mathrm { C } { - } \\alpha$ were $E$ in 2 and $Z$ in 3. In order to assign their absolute configurations, $( R ) { - } 2$ and $( R ) { - } 3$ were separately subjected to ECD/TDDFT calculations. As can be seen in Figure 4, the calculated ECD curve of $( R ) { - } 2$ agreed well with the experimental spectrum of the mixture, whereas, that of $( R )$ 3 was largely inconsistent with the measured spectrum. Nevertheless, the summed ECD spectrum of $( R ) { - } 2$ and $( R )$ -3(7:3） showed the best fit with the experimental spectrum, indicating the $R$ configuration of C-4 in both compounds. Therefore, the structures of 2 and 3 were elucidated as $( E )$ and (Z)-2,3-dehydroanhydrocycloheximides, respectively. It is noted that a compound of unspecified absolute configuration was recently reported to possess the same planar structure as 3 calculated spectra of the mixture of(R)-2/3 (7:3) and individual $( R ) { - } 2$ and $( R )$ -3 inMeOH ( $\\mathbf { \\sigma } _ { \\infty } =$ $0 . 3 8 \\mathrm { e V } ,$ shift $= + 1 8 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ , scaling factor $= 0 . 4 4$ , 0.14,and 0.13, respectively).

However, as all experiments in the present study were carried out either in the dark (fermentation) or under indoor light (extraction and fractionation),with neither direct sunlight shining into nor any artificial high-energy light being applied in the laboratory, we doubted if the fast conversion was induced by our laboratory indoor light. Thus, compounds 2 and 3 in the mixture were separated by preparative HPLC and their MeOH solutions were exposed to the natural indoor light at room temperature and subjected to UPLC analysis every 12 hrs. As a result, the interconversion between 2 and 3 was found to occur before 12 hrs and reach equilibrium (estimated ratios between 2/3 were 52:48 in 2 and 53:47 in 3 according to peak area intensities) at 36 hrs (Figure 5), whereas no changes were detected for the solutions kept in the dark (Figure 5), confirming the interconversion is a photoinduced geometrical isomerization.

To uie uest OI ouI Kluwieuge, $Z { - } E$ pHOtOIsOIeIizauOIs OI cOIpOuIus Wiu uIs KIHu OI chromophore had been rarely reported. For better understanding the insights into this reaction, we conducted theoretical investigation using the truncated structures 2a and 3a (Figure 1). At first, the lowest-energy geometries of 2a and 3a in MeOH in the ground $\\mathrm { ( S _ { 0 } ) }$ , first singlet excited $\\mathrm { ( S _ { 1 } ) }$ , and first triplet excited $\\left( \\mathrm { T } _ { 1 } \\right)$ states were optimized at the B3LYP/def2-SVP level. Starting from these energy minima, other equilibrium points rotating around the $\\mathrm { C } _ { 6 } – \\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ double bond in $\\mathrm { S } _ { 0 } , \\mathrm { S } _ { 1 }$ ,and $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ states were located by relaxed potential energy surface scans, except for geometries around torsion angles （204号 $( \\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { C _ { 6 } } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { C _ { \\mathrm { \\varnothing } } } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { C _ { \\beta } } , \\mathrm { \\varnothing ) }$ of $9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ and $- 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ in the $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ surface, for which optimizations failed to converge.Due to the presence of the stereogenic center C-4 in 2a and 3a, the twisted structures around $\\phi 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ and $- 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ are diastereomeric in chirality [15]. Thus, two twisted minima, $\\mathbf { P }$ and $\\mathbf { P ^ { \\prime } }$ 0 $\\langle \\phi = 7 7 ^ { \\circ }$ and $- 8 4 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ ,respectively) in the $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ surface and two energy maxima ( $\\langle \\phi = 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $- 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ ，respectively） in $\\mathrm { S } _ { 0 }$ surface were located. The resultant potential energy surfaces of the three states and the geometries of key stationary points are shown in Figure 6. The key bond lengths and torsion angles $\\phi$ of these geometries are presented in Table 2. Compound 4 has a structure similar to 2 except for replacement of the C-2/C-3 double bond by a single bond. Its geometrical isomerization was not observed in the present study， but $( E )$ -2-ethylidenecyclohexanone, which has a similar chromophore to that of 4, was reported to be able to give the $Z .$ -isomer upon photoirridiation [16]. For comparison purpose, the truncated structure (4a, Figure 1) of this compound was also calculated using the same methods. The lowest-energy geometries of $( E )$ and $( Z ) \\mathbf { - 4 a }$ in the $\\mathrm { S } _ { 0 }$ $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ (E-4a- ${ \\bf \\cdot } { \\bf S } _ { 1 }$ , Z-4a-Si), and $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ (P-4a, P'-4a) surfaces and the two energy maxima ( $E$ -4a-Ti, Z-4a-Ti) in the $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ surface were optimized and their key geometrical parameters are also listed in Table 2. Analysis of geometrical parameters of key points in the excited and ground states (Table 2) showed that the $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ minima of $\\pmb { 2 \\mathrm { a } } / 3 \\mathbf { a }$ correspond to stable $^ 1 ( \\mathrm { n } - \\pi ^ { * } )$ and $^ 3 ( \\pi - \\pi ^ { * } )$ states of $\\lvert \\alpha , \\beta$ -enones [14]，respectively,and the $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ planar maxima, with increased $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { O } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 6 } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { \\alpha } }$ bond lengths and a decreased $\\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \\mathrm { - C _ { 6 } }$ bond length relative to those of $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ minima, show similarity to a $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ （ $\\pi { - } \\pi ^ { * }$ species [14]. Comparison of parameters of geometries in excited states between $\\pmb { 2 \\mathbf { a } } / 3 \\mathbf { a }$ and 4a revealed that the electron delocalization are extended to C-2 and C-3 in the $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ minima 2b and 3b and due to this, their $\\mathrm { C _ { 1 } } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { C _ { 6 } }$ bond length is increased by about $0 . 0 4 \\textup { \\AA }$ while that of $\\mathrm { C } _ { 6 } – \\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ is decreased by about $0 . 0 3 \\mathrm { ~ \\AA ~ }$ with respect to those in $E { \\cdot } 4 { \\bf a } { \\cdot } { \\bf S } _ { 1 }$ and $\\textstyle Z - 4 \\mathbf { a } - \\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ (Table 2), implying that the presence of $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ double bond in $\\pmb { 2 \\mathbf { a } } / 3 \\mathbf { a }$ strengthens $\\mathrm { { C } _ { 6 } \\mathrm { { - } } \\mathrm { { C } _ { \\mathrm { { a } } } } }$ double bond and increases the rotational barrier of $\\mathrm { C } _ { 6 } – \\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ bond in the $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ （ $( \\mathrm { n } \\mathrm { - } \\pi ^ { \\ast } )$ state.

Instead, radiationless relaxations via an intersystem crossing (ISC) from the $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ minima 2b and 3b to the $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ maxima 2c and 3c, respectively, are energetically and symmetrically reasonable [14,17] as well as are preferred according to El-Sayed's rules [18]. Therefore, the isomerization of $\\pmb { 2 } \\mathbf { a } / 3 \\mathbf { a }$ ,after vertical excitation, is proposed to proceed in the route as shown in Figure 6,which involves radiationless decay from the $\\mathbf { S } _ { 1 }$ minima to the triplet manifold via an ISC and then from the $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ twisted minima to the ground state via a second ISC, leading to isomerization of the $\\mathrm { C } _ { 6 } – \\mathrm { C } _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ double bond. This route is generally similar to those proposed for isomerization of the C-C double bond in acyclic $\\alpha , \\beta$ -enones [14,17], but more complicated in details.Due to the presence of two $\\mathrm { T } _ { 1 }$ minima and two $\\mathrm { S } _ { 0 }$ maxima, there are two equivalent points for the second ISC, one around $\\phi = 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ the other around $\\phi = - 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ ， and two points being with slightly different energy gaps.

The weak reactivity of 4 in photoisomerization (not observed in the present study)can be attributable mainly to its higher vertical excitation energy (87.1 kcal/mol in 4a) relative to those of 2 (81.6 kcal/mol in 2a) and 3 (79.5 kcal/mol in 3a).

For computations of ECD spectra, the conformers generated by a MMFF conformational search in an energy window of 10 kcal/mol were subjected to geometry optimization using the dispersioncorrected DFT-D3 method [25] at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level.

The more accurate energies of these conformers in MeOH were obtained with the B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP method. Solvent effects were taken into account by using polarizable continuum model (PCM). The TDDFT calculations were performed using the hybrid BHandHLYP [26], M11 [27], and/or PBE1PBE [28,29] functionals,and Ahlrichs’ basis set TZVP (triple zeta valence plus polarization [30]. The number of excited states per each molecule was 24. The ECD spectra were generated by the program SpecDis [31] using a Gaussian band shape from dipole-length dipolar and rotational strengths. Equilibrium population of each conformer at 298.15K was calculated from its relative free energies using Boltzmann statistics. The calculated spectra were generated from the low-energy conformers according to the Boltzmann weighting of each conformer in MeOH solution. ",
