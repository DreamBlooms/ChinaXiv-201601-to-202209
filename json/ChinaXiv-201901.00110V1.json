Germination tests in different photoperiods ( $^ { 1 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ light/ $^ { 1 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ darkness and total darkness) and thermoperiods $( 1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ）were conducted for seeds collected in 2012,2013,2014,2015 and 2016.The seeds collected in 2016 were sown under different salinity levels (O,100,200,400 and $6 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m M \\ N a C l } )$ to assess the salinity tolerance during the germination. Wings' presence highly inhibited seed germination of this species in both photoperiods and thermoperiods under all salinity level treatments.In addition,the germination recovery occurred well when seeds were deprived of their wings. The photoperiod of $1 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ light/ $^ { \\cdot _ { 1 2 \\mathrm { h } } }$ darkness and the thermoperiod of $1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ were the best conditions for seed germination. Germination percentages of $H .$ iraqensis seeds decreased with the increasing storage duration, especially after three years of the collction.In addition, $H .$ （204 iraqensis seeds were able to germinate under different salinity levels,and their germination percentages decreased with increasing salinity levels. $H .$ iraqensis seeds have the ability to recover their germination after alleviating the salt stres,irrespective of photoperiod,highlighting the halophilous character of this species.

Substrate salinity is one of the factors that mainly affects species germination and growth in arid and semi-arid regions (Paul, 2O12; Flowers and Colmer, 2015; Song and Wang,2015; Bhatt and Santo, 2017a). Halophytes have the ability to adapt to the dry saline soil conditions through morphological， anatomical and physiological adaptations (Flowers and Colmer， 2008； Hasanuzzaman et al.， 2014； Song and Wang,2015). Therefore, planting halophytic plants could be a potential way to rehabilitate the salt-affected lands in arid and semi-arid regions.Furthermore,halophytes might be used as fodder and fuel or for medicinal purposes (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2014; Gairola et al.,2015; Song et al.,2016; Xu et al., 2016).

In particular, under natural conditions, germination ofhalophytic species is controlled by environmental factors such as light (Huang et al.,2003,Bhatt et al.,2016a), temperature (El-Keblawy et al.,2013; Bhatt et al., 2016b)and soil salinity(Khan et al.,2002; El-Keblawy and Bhat,2015; Bhattand Santo,2016). The requirement to adapt to each of these environmental factors varies among species,and therefore each halophyte responds differently during its seed germination phase (Khan and Ungar,1997; Noe and Zedler, 2000).

        "text": "The ex-situ storage of germplasm is a necessary step for the long-term conservation of rare and endangered species,and the duration of successful storage without the loss of seed viability varies among species. Thus,knowing the seed longevity of a species is essential for its effective management and long-term conservation (Li et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2016). Seed banks are widely used for the conservation of threatened and economically important species,due to the possibility to conserve large amounts of genetic diversity (seeds) within a small volume, and consequently with relatively low management costs (Martin et al., 200l). However, seed storage may often negatively influence seed viability in relation to conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) and time of storage (Shaban,2013; Mahmood et al., 2016). It is a fundamental part of maintaining a seed bank by continuous monitoring seed viability through germination testing at regular intervals, which allows evaluating the genetic and physiological erosion during the storage period (Ruiz et al., 1999). Some studies have been already conducted to assess the seed viability after ex-situ storage of some desert halophytes, such as Salsola imbricata (Zaman et al., 2010; El-Keblawy， 2014)， Zygophylum qatarense (Zaman， 2013） and Haloxylon salicornicum (El-Keblawy, 2014). However, the effects of storage on seed viability are unknown for most of the desert halophytes. ",

Several species of this genus are used as fodder and for medicinal purposes (Kinzikaeva, 1968；Musaddiq et al.，2015). Previous studies confirmed that all the species of Halothamnus have a unique $\\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }$ photosynthesis mechanism and this gives them more resistance to drought and high salinity as compared to $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ plants (Zalensky 1981; Yin and Wang, 1997).

It is widely spoted in Saudi Arabia, UAE,Kuwait, Oman and Iraq (Kothe-Heinrich,1993). The seeds of $H .$ iraqensis are enclosed by a persistent wing which is retained in the mature fruit with the pericarp (Mandaville,2O11). The wings' presence helps this species in its seed dispersal, which occurs through anemochory (Kothe-Heinrich, 1993). Most species of the Halothamnus (including H. iraqensis) which are frequently grazed by camels, sheep and goats have excellent sand-fixation ability and can tolerate extreme temperatures,high drought and high salinity. Therefore, $H .$ iraqensis has the potential to be used for rehabilitating the degraded arid and salt-affected lands (Kinzikaeva,1968). However,until now, there is no information available on the effects of long-term seed storage and role of wing on its seed germination and salinity tolerance. It could be in help for restoration or rehabilitation of salt-stressed habitats to understand the long-term seed storage behavior of $H$ .iraqensis (Fenner and Thompson, 20o5; Liu et al., 2011). ",

Moreover, the wing presence can reduce the correct water absorption because the wing is a tissue that can accumulate chloride ions or high concentrations of abscisic acid (Takeno and Yamaguchi,1991; El-Keblawy etal.,2013; Xing et al.,2013; Bhatt et al., 2016a, b). In this study, both winged and de-winged seeds of $H .$ . iraqensis were able to absorb water, which means that wing will not stopped the correct water absorption, however it does inhibit the seed germination. In our case, some winged seeds $( < 1 9 \\%$ ； Figs. 1 and 2) collected in 2014,2015 and 2016 were able to germinate, indicating that the wing might not be fully rigid at that time to create a mechanical barrier for radicle emergence. However, the wing might become more rigid with storage duration,which might explain why the seeds with longer storage duration did not germinate. Further investigations are needed for a better understanding of the germination inhibition mechanism due to the wings' presence. ",

This might be caused by the aging of the seeds or the storage conditions. Storage duration can alter the endogenous hormone level and seed-coat phenolics,which ultimately afect the seed germination. With the increasing storage duration, phenolics and abscisic acid concentrations significantly increased (Li et al.,2Oo8; Xu et al.,2016). Thus,decreasing level of gibberelic acid and increasing phelolics combined with the increasing storage duration of $H .$ iraqensis seeds could be responsible for the poor germination. In this study, $H .$ .iraqensis seeds were able to maintain the germination percentages up to $9 5 \\%$ and $70 \\%$ after the collection for three and four years, respectively, under the photoperiod and thermoperiod of $1 2 \\mathrm { h } / 1 2$ h of light at $1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ or $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , indicating that the seeds are tolerant to desiccation and can be successfully stored at room temperature up to 3-4 years without excessive loss of their viability. In the natural desert habitat, the longevity of seeds may be attributed to the presence of persistent wing by providing physical and chemical barriers to the unfavorable and unpredictable desert environmental conditions. In this study,seeds were stored with the presence of wing at room temperature and wings were only removed at the time of the test and therefore our results can be predictive about the possibility of seed longevity under natural conditions. However, further studies are needed to determine how seeds without wings can maintain their viability if they are stored in similar conditions of the winged seeds in our study. ",

On the contrary， when wings were maintained, only less than $2 \\%$ of seeds germinated under allte tested salinity levels (Fig. 2). This patern might be an indication that wing is likely a source of accumulation of salts which inhibit the germination in this species as reported in other species of Amaranthaceae (Baskin and Baskin, 2014). Germination percentages of $H .$ iraqensis seeds decreased with increasing salinity level, but a very high germination percentage $( 7 7 \\% )$ was recorded for de-winged seeds under $4 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m M \\ N a C l }$ ，reflecting the reasonably high salinity tolerance of seeds of this species. These findings indicate that $H .$ .iraqensis has the potential to be used in salt-affected lands by sowing its seeds directly instead of planting adult individuals, which can greatly reduce the economic costs of restoration ecology activities. When the $H .$ iraqensis seeds are sown in saline substrate, germination percentages are higher in the light treatment than in the dark treatment,and increasing salinity negatively affected germination percentages in the dark treatment as compared to the light treatment. This patern might indicate that seeds remain near the soil surface could be able to germinate even with few rainfall events that could reduce the surface salinity. However, if they are buried too deep in the soil, the unavailability of light, together with the higher salinity level, could reduce the possibility of their germination. Our results are in accordance with previous studies (El-Keblawy and Bhatt,2O15； Bhatt et al., 2016a,b; El-Keblawy et al.,2Ol6) which reported that light and salinity have positive interactive effects on seed germination compared with the total darkness in presence of salinity and, therefore, some of the halophyte seeds germinate better in presence of light when salts are also present in the substrate.
