Hydrogen peroxide is one of the most important intermediate compounds formed which guides and controls the downstream chain of reactions in the temperature range of $8 5 0 \\mathrm { K }$ to $1 2 0 0 \\mathrm { K }$ (Hong et al. 2011). Hydrogen peroxide is also used as monopropellant using the catalytic decomposition technique in some types of rocket engines.It has its future as a green monopropellant (Westbrook 2Ooo). For the delivery of micro satellites in the orbits,it is an established monopropellant fuel (Davenas et al. 2oo4). It is also being utilized as an oxidizer in some rocket engines. It has also found its utility for the alignment of satellites and attitude control pur poses.Besides hydrogen peroxide has numerous industrial applications; for instance treatment of waste water, industrial waste treatment, bleaching of textile products and bleaching of paper etc. ",
