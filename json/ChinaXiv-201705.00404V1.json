Scheme 1 demonstrates the steps.The weight percent of the thermally exfoliated graphene was 5 wt $\\%$ with respect to the dianhydride and diamine monomers.Suspension of the thermally exfoliated graphene in DMAc $\\mathrm { ( 1 . 0 ~ m g / m L ) }$ was first prepared by ultrosonication treatment,and then mixed with PMDA and ODA.After being stirred for $2 4 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，excess of solvent was distilled off to obtain viscous poly(amic acid)/ graphene solution,which was then cast on glass and imidized. The complete imidization of poly(amic acid) was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The resulting polyimide film and polyimide/ graphene composite film had a thickness of around $3 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .The dispersion and distribution of the thermally exfoliated graphene in polyimide matrix was investigated by TEM.As indicated by the TEM micrograph in Figure 1,graphene sheets were homogeneously dispersed in polyimide matrix and there were almost no large aggregates.Furthermore,obvious orientation of graphene sheets along the film surface was observed.This could be attributed to the high thermal expansion coefficient of glass, which induced the orientation of polyimide molecular chains and also graphene sheets during imidization.26 ",

The measured density of polyimide film was $1 . 3 9 \\ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ . It was in good agreement with the value of commercial Kapton film $( 1 . 4 2 ~ \\mathrm { \\ g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ .36 The polyimide/graphene composite film also had similar density $( 1 . 4 1 ~ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ to the pure polyimide film. Forboth samples, their density increased from around $1 . 4 0 ~ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ to around $1 . 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ after heat treatment at $1 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for $^ \\textrm { \\scriptsize 1 h }$ .In the range $1 0 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ ，their densities decreased significantly (from around 1.60 to $1 . 3 2 ~ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ．The downward trend in density with increasing heat treatment temperature was also reported by Kipling and Zaldivar,and they attributed this to the result of formation of micropore.21,37After being heattreated at $2 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for $^ \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ ，the density of polyimde/graphene composite film increased to $1 . 6 5 ~ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ ，which was much higher than the corresponding value of polyimide film $( 1 . 3 6 ~ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } )$ ： Graphitization is a process of transforming disordered carbon structure into perfectly stacked graphite,which is highly crystalline and has a theoretical density of $2 . 2 6 ~ \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ .38 The higher density of $2 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } .$ -treated polyimide/graphene composite film than $2 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ -treated polyimide filmalso indicated that the polyimide in the composite may experience some degree of graphitization at this temperature with the assistance of graphene.21 ",
