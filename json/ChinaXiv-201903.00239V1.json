The interaction mechanisms between water erosion and wind erosion is the key to further our understanding of the complex erosion. Therefore,in-depth understandings of the influences of water erosion on wind erosionis needed.This research used a wind tunnel and two rainfallsimulators to investigate the influences of water erosion on succeeding wind erosion. The wind erosion measurements before and after water erosion were run on semi-fixed aeolian sandy soil configured with three slopes ( $\\cdot 5 ^ { \\circ }$ ， $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $1 5 ^ { \\circ } { }$ ),sixwind speeds (0,9,11,13,15 and $2 0 \\mathrm { m / s }$ ),and five rainfall intensities (O,30,45,60 and $7 5 \\mathrm { { m m } / h }$ ).Results showed that water erosion generally restrained the succeeding wind erosion. At a same slope, the restraining effects decreased as rainfall intensity increased,which decreased from $70 . 6 3 \\%$ to $50 . 2 0 \\%$ with rainfall intensity increased from 30 to $7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m / h }$ . Rills shaped by water erosion could weaken the restraining effects at wind speed exceeding $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ mainly by cutting through the fine grain layer,exposing the sand layer prone to wind erosion to airflow. In addition,the restraining effects varied greatly among different soil types. The restraining effects of rainfallon the succeeding wind erosion depend on the formation of a coarsening layer with a crust and a compact fine grain layer after rainfall.The findings can deepen the understanding of the complex erosion and provide scientific basis for regional soil and water conservation in arid and semi-arid regions.

For example,an increased soil moisture content can reduce the soil erodibility (wind erosion) and shorten the duration of wind erosion. Chepil(1956) found that, with the increase of soil moisture content, soil erodibility (wind erosion) first decreased slowly, then decreased rapidly, and finally stabilized at a value point where soil particles could no longer be blown away. However, the value of soil moisture content at which soil particles cannot be blown away varied widely among soil types (Ravi et al.， 2Oo6). Physical crusts, formed after soil experiencing rainfall and natural-air drying,can increase the wind speed threshold by as much as $2 5 0 \\%$ and therefore restrain the succeeding wind erosion (Chepil,1953,1958; Gillette et al.,1982; Zobeck, 1991; Rice et al., 1996; Argaman et al., 2006).

However, rils (oriented roughness) intersecting with airflow at a high angle can hold up and deposit wind-blown materials in the leeward area of the rills,and decrease the wind erosion amount. However, rills parallel to airflow can significantly enhance both wind speed and turbulence through the funneling effect (Burgess et al.，1989；Banuelos-Ruedas et al.,2010), leading to an increased wind erosion amount. In addition, airflow carrying fine particles supplied by previous water erosion in rills can form sand-driving wind, which can increase the capability of wind erosion up to a dozen times (Zou et al., 1994).

Rainfall compacted and coarsened the topsoil and a hard fine grain layer formed after air-dryng, which restrained the succeeding wind erosion (Rice et al.,1996; Argaman et al., 2006). However, wind erosion features of the rils were different from those of the inter-rill or the beds without rils,and mainly presented abrasion of rill head and lateral erosion of rill walls (Zhang et al.,2016; Yang et al.,20l7). In our experiments,the rills weakened the restraining effects regardless of the wind speed,and the effects were significant when the wind speed exceeded $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ (Fig. 4), indicating that the rils could weaken the restraining effects at higher wind speeds.The main reasons for rills weakening the restraining efects included: (1) the rils can cut through the hard fine grain layer and expose the sand layer below to airflow (Chepil,1951; Eldridge and Leys,2003),resulting in a higher wind erosion rate compared with the inter-rill; (2) water erosion materials remaining in the rills can serve as erodible substances for the succeeding wind erosion; and (3) the rils changed the micro-topography and enhanced the wind speed and turbulence of the succeeding wind erosion through the funnelling effect (Bowen and Lindley,1977).

Chepil (1953,1958) estimated that the restraining effects of crusts varied from $60 \\%$ to $96 \\%$ at a wind speed of $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ . Zobeck(1991） found that some crusts formed on mineral soils and organic soils can be much more effective at reducing total soil erosion and the restraining effects were $9 0 . 2 0 \\% - 9 9 . 9 8 \\%$ and $8 0 . 0 0 \\%$ ，respectively. In our experiments,water erosion restrained the succeeding wind erosion of the aeolian sandy soil by $5 5 . 4 2 \\% - 6 1 . 9 1 \\%$ at a wind speed of $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ . This result is consistent with that reported by Chepil（1953,1958) but is smaller than that by Zobeck (1991). In addition, for semi-fixed aeolian sandy soil in experiments and chestnut soil in pre-experiments, at wind speed of around $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ , the restraining effect of the former $( 6 0 . 5 3 \\% )$ was smaller than the later $( 9 9 . 2 4 \\% )$ ，while the restraining effect of sandy loess soil $( 8 1 . 0 8 \\% )$ (Song et al.,2007) was observed between the two soils above.

Compared with beds with soil surfaces wetted by spray bottle,topsoil of the beds experiencing simulated rainfall was more compacted and its particle size distribution was closer to topsoil under natural conditions.Besides, most existing research investigated the restraining effects at a certain wind speed,rather than a sequence of wind speeds in our experiments. Therefore, the results based on the experiments more appropriately presented the influences of water erosion on wind erosion. Furthermore, the restraining effects at low rainfall intensities were higher than those at high rainfall intensities, indicating that the rills created by rainfallcould weaken the restraining effects.Additionally,due to limitation of small size of the soil bed,soil erosion from upslope runoff was not obvious when compared with that occurred under the natural conditions. Thus,field monitoring and experiments on larger-scale soil bed are needed to further explore the interaction between water erosion and wind erosion. ",
