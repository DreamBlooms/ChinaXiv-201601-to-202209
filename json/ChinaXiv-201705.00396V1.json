Great efforts have been devoted to describe the various factors which influence the dynamic magnetic characteristics,e.g. the thermal treatment conditions [5,6], the DC current excitation[7- 9],the non-sinusoidal excitation [1O], the AC magnetic field amplitude [11,12].However, few investigations have been done on analyzing the AC magnetic properties of ferromagnetic amorphous alloys at various operating temperature.

Every deactivation of one magnetization mechanism results in a decrease of $\\mu ^ { \\prime }$ and an occurrence of single peak in $\\mu ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ frequency dependence.This magnetic relaxation behavior resultsin the dispersion of magnetic permeability.
