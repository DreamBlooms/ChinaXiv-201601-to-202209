        "text": "Abstract: As the largest inland river basin of China,the Tarim River Basin (TRB),known for its various natural resources and fragile environment,hasan increased risk of ecological crisis due to the intensive exploitation and utilization of water and land resources. Since the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP), which was implemented in 2O01 to save endangered desert vegetation, there has been growing evidence of ecological improvement in local regions,but few studies have performed a comprehensive ecological vulnerability assessment of the whole TRB.This study established an evaluation framework integrating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy method to estimate the ecological vulnerability of the TRB covering climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic indicators during 2000-2017. Based on the geographical detector model, the importance of ten driving factors on the spatial-temporal variations of ecological vulnerability was explored.The results showed that the ecosystem of the TRB was fragile, with more than half of the area $( 5 7 . 2 7 \\% )$ dominated by very heavy and heavy grades of ecological vulnerability, and $2 8 . 4 0 \\%$ of the area had potential and light grades of ecological vulnerability. The light grade of ecological vulnerability was distributed in the northern regions (Aksu River and Weigan River catchments) and western regions (Kashgar River and Yarkant River catchments),while the heavy grade was located in the southern regions (Kunlun Mountains and Qarqan River catchments） and the Mainstream catchment. The ecosystems in the western and northern regions were less vulnerable than those in the southern and eastern regions.From 200O to 2017,the overallimprovement in ecological vulnerability in the whole TRB showed that the areas with great ecological improvement increased by $4 6 . 1 1 \\%$ ，while the areas with ecological degradation decreased by $9 . 6 4 \\%$ . The vegetation cover and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were the obvious driving factors, explaining $5 7 . 5 6 \\%$ and $2 1 . 5 5 \\%$ of the changes in ecological vulnerability across the TRB,respectively. In terms of ecological vulnerability grade changes, obvious spatial diferences were observed in the upper, middle,and lower reaches of the TRB due to the different vegetation and hydrothermal conditions. The alpine source region of the TRB showed obvious ecological improvement due to increased precipitation and temperature,but the alpine meadow of the Kaidu River catchment in the Middle Tianshan Mountains experienced degradation associated with overgrazing and local drought. The improved agricultural management technologies had positive effects on farmland ecological improvement, while the desert vegetation in oasis-desert ecotones showed a decreasing trend as a result of cropland reclamation and intensive drought.The desert riparian vegetation in the lower reaches of the Tarim River was greatly improved due to the implementation of the EWDP, which has been active for tens of years. These results provide comprehensive knowledge about ecological processes and mechanisms in the whole TRB and help to develop environmental restoration measures based on different ecological vulnerability grades in each sub-catchment.

Therefore， it is essential to evaluate ecosystem vulnerability to achieve sustainable economic development and environmental protection in arid and semi-arid regions. ",

        "text": "The concept of 'vulnerability' was previously used for social science and recently used in ecological fields (e.g.， ecological vulnerability， environmental vulnerability， and ecosystem vulnerability) (Beroya-Eitner, 2016). It has various similar expressions (e.g., risk,sensitivity, and fragility) and inverse ideas (e.g.,resilience,adaptability,adaptive capacity, and stability) (Hinkel, 2011). In the context of ecology,'vulnerability' refers to the possibilities of an ecosystem suffering from hazards, disturbances, or pressures over time and space (Williams and Kaputska, 2000) or the risks of severe destruction to the ecosystem (Nguyen et al.,2016). However, how to establish an evaluation criteria system and develop an evaluation model is a key to ecosystem vulnerability assessment. The key indicators of ecosystem assessment vary in the context of space,time,and conditions,so these indicators include not only the current status of socioeconomic indicators or ecological indicators but also indicators with spatial-temporal information that can describe the dynamic variations in an ecosystem at different spatial scales or time scales. With the development of remote sensing (RS） and geographic information system (GIS), land surface parameters such as land use/land cover (LULC),land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation coverage, and topography condition have been widely used as the key indicators that describe the changes in ecosystem status and processes (Nandy et al., 2015; Zou and Yoshino,2017; Zhao et al.,2018; Yu et al.,2020). Additionally, many models and methods have been developed for the quantitative assessment of ecological vulnerability, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Nguyen et al., 2016), principal component analysis (PCA) (Nandy et al.,2015; Zou and Yoshino,2017),entropy method (Ludovisi,2014; Zhao et al.,2018), fuzzy assessment model (Enea and Salemi, 2001),grey model (Silva et al., 2016),and artificial neural network model (Dzeroski, 20o1). However, most of these models determined the weights of the selected indices based on prior knowledge or empirical methods.If some of these weight coefficients are set improperly， the model will overestimate or underestimate the ecological effects during the assessment processes.The entropy method, with a strong theoretical basis of mathematics，determines the weight of the ecological indicators according to the degree of variation of each index (Ludovisi, 2014). Compared with various subjective weighting models, the greatest advantage of the entropy method is that it removes the effect of human interference on the weight of indicators (Zhu et al., 2O2O); however, it ignores the knowledge and experience of experts as well as the intentions and preferences of decision-makers from reality. The AHP method is a mathematical technique used to develop a set of weights by making pairwise comparisons among the criteria into a hierarchical structure (Saaty,2Oo1). It can comprehensively consider experts' opinions and judgements,and it is commonly integrated into objective weight methods to add the knowledge and experience of the experts in decision-making (Du and Gao, ",

        "text": "The Tarim River Basin (TRB) is a typical inland river basin in Northwest China that is known for its arid and semi-arid climate and fragile ecosystems.The ecological environment of the TRB has continued to deteriorate since l96O due to climate change and intensive human activities (Xu et al.,2010). The expansion of agricultural oases represents the aggravation of deforestation and the increase in irrigation, while excessive development and inefficient utilization of water resources have led to a water crisis and ecological degradation in this region,affecting the sustainable development of social,economic,and natural ecosystems. To restore the desert ecosystem and improve the ecological quality in the riparian zones, the local government had launched the ecological water diversion project (EWDP) to transport water to the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River and its tributary system since 2001 (Bao et al.,2017). Many studies have evaluated the ecological effects of the EWDP using field investigations，site observations (Chen et al., 2010; Hao and Li, 2014),and remote sensing monitoring (Bao et al., 2017; Guo et al.,2Ol7), but the results showed very different extents and ranges of influences on the environmental quality of the Tarim River after the implementation of ecological restoration (Chen et al.,2010; Hao and Li, 2014; Ling et al.，2019). Xue et al. (2018) found that the environmental quality of the TRB was not improved,and several regions of the TRB severely deteriorated due to excessive agricultural water consumption and extensive economic development, without regard to the indicators of the ecological environment. In previous studies, more attention was given to the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River, while the upstream regions as well as the fragility and sensitivity of the mountain ecosystem were not considered in the ecological vulnerability assessment. The main ecological problem in the TRB is the uncertainty of ecological vulnerability when it is involved in the interactions among the inland water cycle, eco-environment,and socioeconomic factors.Therefore,it is essential to establish a comprehensive indicator system including meteorological， hydrological， ecological， and economic parameters and to evaluate the ecological vulnerability at the basin scale for the TRB.

The main land use types derived from the LULC map in 2017 included grassland, forestland, cropland, water body, build-up land, and other land use types (including Gobi, desert, bare land,bare rocks, gravels,and glaciers), whose areas accounted for $2 4 . 6 9 \\%$ ， $8 . 0 3 \\%$ ， $4 . 6 9 \\%$ ， $1 . 2 7 \\%$ ， $0 . 4 8 \\%$ and $6 0 . 8 5 \\%$ of the total area,respectively.

The greening of alpine grasslands had positive effects on the ecological environment, especially in the upstream regions of the Kashgar River and Yarkant River catchments (Fig. 5c). The grassland in highlands or lowlands of arid regions was the most sensitive vegetation type to short-term climatic fluctuations and was most severely degraded by human activities (such as overgrazing or clearing) (Jiapaer et al.,2Ol5). Many studies have indicated that the increased vegetation index of grassland is mainly due to increased precipitation instead of rising temperature in the arid regions of Northwest China (Yuan et al.,2015； Zhang et al., 2020). With the climate changing from warm-dry to warm-wet since the 1980s in Xinjiang (Shi et al., 2007), the increasing trends of vegetation growth in grassland have played a positive effect on the improvement of the ecological environment around the TRB,especially in the Karakoram Mountains, Kunlun Mountains,and Altun Mountains. In arid regions, grassland recovers from drought more easily when it receives supplemental water compared to shrubland (Bai et al., 2O19); therefore, ecological water transport has positively promoted grassland regeneration in the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River.
