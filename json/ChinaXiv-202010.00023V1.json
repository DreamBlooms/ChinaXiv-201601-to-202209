        "text": "Abstract: The abundance of broad-leaved weeds in peanut fields represents the handicap in weed management programs,since limited specific herbicides can be recommended to control them. Moreover, the physio-biochemical constituents and nutritional status in peanut plants as affected by available herbicides,i.e.,bentazone under water stress conditions are not well known.Therefore,field trials were conducted during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 to investigate the interactional impact of irrigation levels $( \\mathrm { I } _ { 5 0 } , \\mathrm { ~ \\textit ~ { ~ I ~ } ~ } _ { 5 }$ and $\\mathrm { I } _ { 1 0 0 } \\mathrm { : }$ ，representing irrigation by $50 \\%$ ， $7 5 \\%$ and $100 \\%$ ofcrop evapotranspiration, respectively) and weed control practices (bentazone, bentazone $+$ hoeing once,hoeing twice and weedy check as control) on dominant broad-leaved weeds as wellas peanut physiological and agronomic traits. Result indicated that the eficiency of weed control for each weeded treatment under $\\mathrm { I } _ { 5 0 }$ significantly equaled with its counterpart under $\\mathrm { I } _ { 7 5 }$ or $\\mathrm { { I } } _ { 1 0 0 }$ 、Bentazone+hoeing once diminished weed biomass by $89 . 3 \\%$ and enhanced chlorophyll content of peanut plants by $5 1 . 2 \\%$ .Bentazone relatively caused a reduction in carotenoides. Hoeing twice and bentazone+hoeing once under $\\mathrm { I } _ { 1 0 0 }$ in both growing seasons as well as hoeing twice under $\\mathrm { I } _ { 7 5 }$ in 2017 were the superior combinations for boosting pod yield of peanut plants. Treatment of bentazone $+$ hoeing once and $\\mathrm { I } _ { 7 5 }$ recorded the lowest reduction in $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ utilization percentage and the highest increase in potassium utilization percentage of peanut plants. Eliminating weeds enhanced water use efficiency by $3 7 . 8 \\%$ ， $4 9 . 6 \\%$ and $34 . 7 \\%$ under $\\mathrm { I } _ { 5 0 } , \\ \\mathrm { I } _ { 7 5 }$ and ${ \\mathrm { I } } _ { 1 0 0 } ,$ respectively. In conclusion,peanut seems to be tolerant to bentazone at moderate water supply, thus it can be safely used in controling the associated broad-leaved weeds. ",

Globally，weeds are potentially accountable for $34 \\%$ of crop loss directly competing for water,causing less water available for crop plants (Oerke,2OO6). Many weeds are known to be water wasters (Patterson，1995). Weeds caused about $39 \\%$ reduction in peanut yield and decreased harvesting efficiency under weedy condition (Jhala et al.,2Oo5; Clewis et al., 2007). While，the plant height and dry matter production of peanut were enhanced with weed free environment (Singh and Giri, 2O01). Both water requirements of the vegetation growth and moisture-competitive relations between the cultivated crops and weed plants are disturbed as a result of weed transpiration requirements (Pivec and Brant, 2OO9). Accordingly, combating weed in peanut field is essential for water saving and crop potentiality. ",

        "text": "In spite of dificulty of using herbicides targeting broad-leaved weeds in a broad-leaved crop, bentazone plus hoeing once proved good potentiality against broad-leaved weeds in peanut, since such treatment equaled hoeing twice treatment with slight visual injuries on crop plants. In this respect, bentazone+hoeing once diminished weed biomass by $8 9 . 3 \\%$ (Fig.1） and improved chlorophyll content by $5 1 . 2 \\%$ (Table 2),leveling with hoeing twice under $\\mathrm { I } _ { 7 5 }$ .Tolerance degrees to bentazone among different species are attributed to variations in uptake， translocation and metabolism. Herein,after foliar application,as post-emergence herbicide,bentazone is promptly absorbed by leaves (Vencill, 2002). Antagonistic impacts for plastoquinone action with inhibiting electron flow from photosystem II to photosystem I were obtained with herbicides treatment (Hess,2Ooo), leading to nutrient starvation.Moreover， oxidative stress resulted from reactive oxygen species (ROS） is commonly recognized as the most damaging stress induced by photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides and the cause of cell death (Hess,2OOO;Rutherford and Krieger-Liszkay, 2OO1). Rapid and prolonged production of ROS exceeds the quenching capacity of photo-protective components such as carotenoids, xanthophylls and tocopherol (Krasnovsky Jr, 1998;Trebst, 2003;Loll et al.，2O05),causing severe oxidative damage of proteins,lipids and pigments,and eventually cell membrane destruction and plant death (Hess,2Ooo). Bentazone is a photosystem II-inhibiting herbicide that interferes with photosynthetic electron transport, thriling oxidative stress (Zhu et al.， 2O09),and frustrating growth of susceptible plants as broad-leaved weeds.In bentazone-treated plants，triplet chlorophyll is the prime ROS resulted，which has relatively long lived and can react with $\\mathbf { O } _ { 2 }$ forming toxic singlet oxygen (Rutherford and KriegerLiszkay,200l;Krieger-Liszkay, 2005), hence cell death is realized. Accordingly,in our study, treating broad-leaved weeds with bentazone led to a significant reduction in their biomass. ",

        "text": "Concerning the crop, peanut plants also received drizzles of herbicide during post-emergence application. In this study，bentazone relatively caused reduction in leaf pigments especially carotenoides (Table 2)，however, it seems that plants quickly recovered. The absorption and translocation of bentazone may be faster in sensitive plants than in tolerant ones (Bradshaw et al., 1992).However, Sterling and Balke (1989) clarified that tolerance to bentazone appears to be dramatically due to increased metabolic collapse. Transforming bentazone into glucosyl bentazon through cytochrome P45O might be the reason of its detoxification (Gronwald and Connelly, 1991; Burton and Maness,1992).Plant tissue of soybean,the same family of peanut, is initially injured by bentazone,but then the plants swiftly improve to tolerate the herbicide because of induction of genes involved in glucoside conjugation of acylhydroxybentazon, which is not toxic to plants (Sterling and Balke,1989).Recently, Zhu et al. (2O09) found that soybean treated with bentazone showed symptoms of chlorosis and necrosis by $2 4 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ after treatment but rapidly retrieved their healthy growth by $^ { 4 8 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ，Priya et al. (2O13） clarified that herbicides plus hand weeding achieved acceptable level of weed control with boosting Arachis hypogaea pod yield. ",

        "text": "Data depicted in Figure 2 indicated that mobility and accumulation of N,P and K nutrients differed due to irigation levelxweed control treatments.Herein, bentazone+hoeing once under moderate water supply $\\left( \\mathrm { I } _ { 7 5 } \\right)$ recorded the lowest reduction in $\\mathbf { N }$ utilization percentage and the highest increase in K utilization percentage. This shows that such treatment achieved good balance in absorption of $\\mathsf { N }$ and K,in addition to better mobilization from vegetative parts (leaves and stems） to seeds.Therefore，well practices applied, irrigation levelxweed control, in peanut may afect nutrients distribution. Nutrients absorption and utilization of plants could be promoted through the optimization of management practices (Xue et al., 2O1O). Nzokou and Cregg (2010) reported that increasing water addition through irigation is likely to leach mobile nutrients such as nitrates below the root zone.Moreover, the decrease in assimilation can be buffered by an increase in the plant abilities to provide $\\mathbf { N }$ and other nutrients to various organs. In spite of obtaining higher values of WUE for each weed control treatmentsxIoo (Fig. 3)，the increase percentages depicted proved the potency of hoeing twice or bentazoe $^ +$ hoeing once with I75.This means that such combinations achieved a good balance between the obtained marketable yield and the applied irrigation water, referring to the good utilization of each drop of water.
