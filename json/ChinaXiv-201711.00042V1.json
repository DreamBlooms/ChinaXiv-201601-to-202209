Thus,their design method is not suffciently established,and their performance is often low.The ultimate goal of this research is to establish high-performance design guidelines and design methods for smallpropeler-type wind turbines.To that end,we designed two rotors: Rotor A,based on the rotor optimum design method from the blade element momentum theory,and Rotor B,in which the chord length of the tip is extended and the chord length distribution is linearized.We examined performance characteristics and flow fields of the two rotors through wind tunnel experiments and numerical analysis.Our results revealed that the maximum output tip speed ratio of Rotor B shifted lower than that of Rotor A,but the maximum output coefficient increased by approximately $3 8 . 7 \\%$ .Rotors Aand B experienced a large-scale separation on the hub side, which extended to the mean in Rotor A.This difference in separation had an impact on the significant decrease in Rotor A's output compared to the design value and the increase in Rotor B's output compared to Rotor A.

These wind turbines have been upsized and are being introduced not only on coastal lands and mountainous areas but also on offshore locations.On the other hand, the use of small propeller-type wind turbines is expected to become familiar in environments such as urban areas and suburbs; ",

Specifically, in a small propeller-type wind turbine,the Reynolds number is low,and there are limited usable airfoil materials; thus,itis important to examine optimal properties and flow fields of rotors in the turbine.In recent years，reverse taper blades，in which the chord length is lengthened toward the tip,in contrast with small propeller-type wind turbines designed using the blade element momentum theory, have been employed,and they have been experimentally shown to be effective at improving the turbine performance within low rotational speed ranges[9,1O].However, the details on the mechanism of the performance improvement are unknown. At this point,a design method for a small propeller-type wind turbine has not been established. ",
