Additionally, the combination of iron and nickel can significantly increase the water splitting ability by taking advantage of synergistic metal-metal interactions.16-20 Furthermore,LDHs are more favorable toward water dissociation than that of metal oxides in alkaline electrolytes.16 For example, NiFeLDH nanosheets present comparable water splitting activity to that of scarce and expensive materials, such as $\\mathrm { I r O } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { R u O } _ { 2 }$ .19 Despite some achievements, two fundamental limitations which have plagued the ful use of LDH supported Pt nanocatalysts stillremain: (i) in the contact interfaces between Pt NPs and LDH support, which part ( $( \\mathbf { M } ^ { 2 + } \\mathbf { O } _ { 6 }$ or $\\mathrm { M } ^ { 3 + } \\mathrm { O } _ { 6 }$ octahedra) is decisive in immobilizing Pt NPs is still not clear; (i) traditional solution reduction method, reduce Pt precursors with reductant in liquids, cannot ensure that all $\\mathrm { P t }$ nanosrystals directly grown on the LDH supports.

Moreover, after 1200 cycles of CV tests, the peak current density of Pto.54/NiFe-LDH/rGO still remained at $8 6 . 5 \\%$ (Figure S10). By comparison, the commercial $\\mathrm { P t / C }$ electrocatalyst can only retain $6 1 . 3 \\%$ of its initial peak current (Figure S11).

As shown in Figure 6, the average size of Pt NPs in $\\mathrm { P t } _ { 0 . 1 2 } / \\mathrm { N i } ( \\mathrm { O H } ) _ { 2 } / \\mathrm { r G O }$ increased from $1 . 5 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ to $4 . 1 2 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ . The Pt nanocrystal in Pto.54/NiFe-LDH/rGO showed a slight increase from 2.1 nm to $2 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ in average size. In general, the surface energy of Pt NPs is closely linked to its size, and the initial Pt NPs of two contrasting samples should be similar in size.34 Therefore, $\\mathrm { P t } _ { 0 . 3 6 } / \\mathrm { N i F e } -$ LDH/rGO and $\\mathrm { P t } _ { 0 . 2 4 } / \\mathrm { N i } ( \\mathrm { O H } ) _ { 2 } / \\mathrm { r G O }$ were selected as contrasting samples because of their same average size of Pt nanocrystals prior to MOR testing (1.89 nm vs.1.84 nm).

Consequently, severe agglomeration of Pt NPs occurred on the $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ support during MOR,which caused the quick deactivation of $\\mathrm { P t } _ { x } / \\mathrm { N i } ( \\mathrm { O H } ) _ { 2 } / \\mathrm { r G O }$ electrocatalysts.

Figure S15 shows that after 60O cycles of CV test, the latest CV curves of $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) _ { 2 } / r G O }$ and NiFe-LDH/rGO supports exhibited almost no change compared with their initial ones.
