Surprisingly，the expression of Nanog-VP16 in mouse ES cells induces differentiation and is thus unable to sustain LIF-independent self-renewal for mouse ES cells.Taken together, our results demonstrate that the CD2 domain of Nanog is a unique transactivator that utilizes aromatic residues to conferspecific activityabsolutely required forES self-renewal.

One of them is CD2 (C-terminal domain 2), which has been shown to be as potent as the virally encoded VP16 ina Gal4-based transactivation assay (1O).Here we demonstrate that CD2 is required for Nanog-mediated self-renewal of ES cells without LIF.Furthermore,we have uncovered an array of aromatic residues within CD2 that are required both for its transactivationactivityandES cell self-renewal.

We have previously generated a CD2-truncated Nanog and demonstrated that it remains active in mediating the transactivation of reporters bearing Nanog-binding sites (1O). To begin to assess the role CD2 in ES cell self-renewal, this mutant was cloned into the expression vector pPyCAGIP(a gift from Chambers (6)) and stably transfected into mouse ES cells.As shown in Fig. 1A (panel1),mouse ES cells transfected with control vector (panels $a$ and $d$ ）underwent spontaneous differentiation in the absence of LIF (panel d versus panel a) morphologically, forming disorganized clumps of flat cels.As expected, ES cells overexpressing wild type Nanog showed pluripotent morphology in the absence of LIF (Fig. 1A, panels e versus panels $b$ )with clones of small and compact cells (6). On the other hand,ES cells expressing CD2-truncated Nanog became differentiatedinthe absence of LIF as the control (Fig. 1A, panels $f$ versus panels d), suggesting that the CD2 domain is required for Nanog-mediated LIFindependent ES cell self-renewal. Representative clones from similar experiments in Fig. 1A (panel 1) were shown with higher magnification in Fig.1A (panel 2). To further confirm the pluripotent states of the cells in Fig.1A,we analyzed the expression levels ofpluripotent markers Nanog,Oct4,and Rexl by quantitative RT-PCR as presented in Fig.1B.In the absence of LIF,ES cells expressing the CD2 truncation mutant did not sustain the expression ofboth Rexl and $_ \\mathrm { O c t 4 }$ ,whereas ES cells expressing the wild type Nanog did (Fig. 1B). Because the primers we used for Nanog detection were designed for both endogenous and the transfected Nanog constructs in Fig. $1 B$ (left column), we estimate that the contribution of exogenous Nanog or NanogCD2 to the overall Nanog expression levels to be $\\sim 1 \\times$ or $2 \\times$ ，respectively,in agreement with the results from Western blots shown in Fig.1C.

Employing the p5N reporter system, this mutant reveals a ${ \\sim } 1 2$ -fold activity compared with wild type Nanog in mouse ES cells (shown in Fig. 6C).However, when we introduced the pPyCAGIP-Nanog-VP16 into mES cells as described inFig.1, it fails to sustain ES cell self-renewal and but induces ES cells differentiation morphologically (shown in Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis shown in Fig. $6 D$ revealed that the transgene of Nanog-VP16 is well expressed (upper band)， whereasthe endogenous Nanog declined in expression even in the presence of LIF.Accordingly, the expression of differentiation markers were induced by Nanog-VP16 based on both RT-PCR (Fig. 6E) and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.6F) analyses. Surprisingly, Nanog-VP16 appears to have induced theEScells differentiating into primitive endoderm,mesoderm,and even trophectoderm based on these markers.

These findings are significant for the following reasons:1) Although Nanog is recognized as a key regulator of ES cell pluripotency and its overexpression alone can sustain ES cell self-renewal independent of LIF,the mechanism of action for Nanog remains undefined.We first reported the transactivation function of Nanog but did not establish the role of transactivation function of Nanog in stem cell self-renewal.

Our approachesinvolvingN-and C-terminal deletion analysis coupled with point mutagenesis revealed that aromatic residues play a critical role in sustaining CD2 activities. Interestingly, VP16,the most potent transactivator reported so far,utilizes aromatic residues to mediate strong transcription activity (12). Although CD2 and VP16 share little sequence homology,the similar requirement for aromatic residues suggests that they may share a commonorganizingprinciple based on aromatic residues.Structural determination of CD2 and VP16 may help to confirm this prediction.3) By mutating the aromatic residues in CD2,we have generated a Nanog mutant that cannot sustain LIF-independent self-renewal yet does not interfere with the activity of endogenous Nanog. One would have expected that Nanog-CD2-mul or -mu2 behave asdominant negative mutants as we demonstrated for Oct4 and Sox2.

Apparently,the level of expression contributed from the wild type Nanog tion in ES cell self-renewal is unique and cannot be replaced by other transactivation domains (Fig.6).Thus,further delineation of downstream genes regulated by CD2 would greatly enhance our understanding of Nanog-mediated ES cell self-renewal.2) We were surprised that the most critical residues within CD2 are aromatic residues.As pointed out in transgene is sufficient to maintain the pluripotency of ES cells in the absence of LIF for the duration of our assay.Interestingly, these ES cells can be induced to undergo differentiation in the presence of RA (data not shown), suggesting that the amount of Nanog contributed by the transgene in our experimental systemis insufficient to preventEScelldifferentiation.This observation is in contrast to those originally reported by Chambers et al.(6) and Matsui et al. (5).This discrepancy may reflect the expression levels of the transgene delivered by the different expression systems (episomal versus integrated).The episome strategy employed by Chambers etal.and Matsui etal.in general can deliver much stronger expression than the integrated approach we adopted.Nevertheless,our results suggest that Nanog function can be analyzed in wild type ES cells upon overexpression at ${ \\sim } 1 \\times$ that of endogenous level.
