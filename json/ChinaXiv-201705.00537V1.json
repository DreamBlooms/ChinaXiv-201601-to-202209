The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of naturally occurring $\\left( \\kappa _ { n a t } \\right)$ and isotopically pure $( \\kappa _ { \\mathrm { p u r e } } )$ silicene are listed in Table 3.The calculated thermal conductivity of free-standing LB silicene is in good agreement with other theoretical results.48,58-60 Compared to LB silicene,much lower thermal conductivity is observed in DB silicene.It should be noticed that only free-standing silicene is considered here.However, in device applications,bothLB and DB silicene are usually synthesized on various substrates,and as a result, the thermal conductivity will be further affected. In fact,for LB silicene,the influence of substrate on the thermal transport is in debate.Wang et al.have found that，in LB silicene, though the coupling of ZA modes to the substrate linearizes the phonon dispersion and increases the group velocity，the relaxation times of the ZA phonons are dramatically decreased, because the presence of the substrate breaks the _reflection symmetry and introduces more phonon scattering.6 Thus, the presence of a $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ substrate results in a large reduction to the thermal conductivity at $3 0 0 \\mathrm { K } .$ However, from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, Zhang et al.have found that by changing the surface crystal plane of the substrate,the thermal conductivity of LB silicene can be either suppressed or enhanced.62 ",
