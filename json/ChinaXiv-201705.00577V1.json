Specifically,metallic Snrich and oxygen-rich SnO polycrystalline films favor (1o1) and (001) preferential orientations,respectively. This suggestion is confirmed again by the result that the SnO film with a $6 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ capping layer shows clear (0o1) and (0o2) XRD peaks after treatment in air (shown in Fig. 2c). After all,oxygen in air can diffuse into the SnO film through the 6 nm $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ thin film (oxygen diffusion coefficient in $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 } \\colon 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 2 5 } \\thinspace \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 } \\thinspace \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { 3 0 }$ and oxidize the residual metallic Sn to some extent during annealing in air. Moreover，it is considered that amorphous (before annealing) SnO flms without the capping layer can easily adsorb oxygen when they are exposed in the air. The oxygen adsorption behavior would be prohibited by introducing the $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ capping layer onto the SnO surface before it is exposed in the air. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding, another group of SnO films with a $6 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ -thick $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ capping layer were also deposited on different substrates as the reference.The growth conditions were the same as the abovementioned ${ \\bf A l } _ { 2 } { \\bf O } _ { 3 }$ -capped films except that the as-deposited SnO films were taken out of the vacuum chamber and kept in air for （204号 $^ { 3 0 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ before introducing the $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ capping layer.As shown in Fig. 2d,all the reference films display the (oo1) preferential orientation,in sharp contrast to the (1o1)-textured growth of the $5 \\ \\mathrm { \\ n m - A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ capped SnO films in Fig. 1a. The comparative results indicate that the immediate capping with $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ layers can modify the stoichiometry of the SnO films by preventing the oxygen adsorption behavior， resulting in the grain growth orientation conversion.However,the adsorbed oxygen is unable to oxidize all the residual metallic Sn in thick SnO films $( > 3 0$ nm).Hence,thick bare SnO films present a (1o1) XRD peak,as seen that this peak intensity increases with the film thickness (ESI,Fig. S1t). Nevertheless,the (0o1)-orientated peaks of the thick films can also be suppressed by immediately capping $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ layers (ESI, Fig. $^ { S 2 \\dagger }$ ),again verifying the effect of the $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ capping layer.Anyway,all the above results illustrate that it is the chemical composition,rather than the film strain or interface energy between $\\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ and SnO that governs the orientation conversion.However，the reason why the grain orientation depends on the chemical composition is unclear now and needs further investigation.
