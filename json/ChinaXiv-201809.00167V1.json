In this study,five absolute homogeneity tests and one clustering approach were used to determine the homogeneity status of the streamflow time series (over the period 1960-2010) in14 hydrometric stations of three important basins (i.e.,Aras River Basin, Urmia Lake Basin and Sefid-Roud Basin) in northwestern Iran.Results of the Buishand range test, von Neumann ratio test,cumulative deviation test,standard normal homogeneity test and Petitt test for monthly streamflow time series detected that about $4 2 . 2 6 \\%$ 5 $3 8 . 0 9 \\%$ ， $3 3 . 3 3 \\%$ 0 $3 9 . 2 8 \\%$ and $6 8 . 4 5 \\%$ of the streamflow time series were inhomogeneous at the O.O1 significance level,respectively. Streamflow time series of the stations located in the eastern parts of the study area or within the Urmia Lake Basin were mostly homogeneous. In contrast,streamflow time series in the stations of the Aras River Basin and Sefied-Roud Basin showed inhomogeneity at annual scales. Based on the overallclassification for the monthly and annual streamflow series, we determined that about $4 5 . 6 0 \\%$ ， $1 1 . 5 3 \\%$ and $4 2 . 8 5 \\%$ of the time series were categorized into the 'useful','doubtful' and'suspect' classes according to the five absolute homogeneity tests. We also found the homogeneity paterns of the streamflow time series by using the clustering approach. The results suggested the effectiveness of the clustering approach for homogeneity analysis of the streamflow time series in addition to the absolute homogeneity tests. Moreover, results of the absolute homogeneity tests and clustering approach indicated obvious decreasing change points of the streamflow time series in the 1990s over the three basins, which were mostly related to the hydrological droughts.

        "text": "The hydrological time series increasingly show non-stationarity behavior and their variables such as streamflow and precipitation series do not show a consistent mean or median for a long period of time mainly due to the natural and anthropogenic changes (Rougé et al., 2O13). Homogeneity analysis in the hydrological time series used for water resources management and project planning is important for detecting the accuracy and validity of data. Meanwhile, homogeneity analysis of the streamflow time series is essential to hydrological modeling and climate change studies. Hydrologic time series sequences are the results of particular natural conditions and might be shown irregular fluctuations when natural conditions of the river basin are relatively steady. However, the hydrologic time series sequences can exhibit evident trends or jumps, if natural conditions change noticeably (Wong et al.,2Oo6).In this regard,for detecting the same paterns of the time series, two important methods can be used to analyze the homogeneity of the streamflow time series,including statistical homogeneity test and clustering approach. Statistical homogeneity test has been used in hydrological analysis for the detection of non-homogeneity which suggested by Hirsch et al. (1982), Hirsch and Slack (1984),Hirsch (1988) and McCuen (2002). Generally,homogeneities of the streamflow time series can be determined by two different statistical approaches,including relative and absolute homogeneity tests (Peterson et al.,1998). Relative homogeneity tests are few to be recommended to use，considering the neighboring stations are hypothetically homogeneous. However, absolute homogeneity tests are recommended to use if the two time series of the neighboring stations are not adequately correlated (Wijngaard et al., 2003). ",

(2003） used the statistical homogeneity tests to analyze the climatic variables in the European continent and reported that about $2 5 \\%$ of the precipitation series and $94 \\%$ of the temperature series were labelled 'suspect' or 'doubtful' over the period 1901-1999. Sahin and Cigizoglu (2010) applied four homogeneity tests (i.e., standard normal homogeneity test,Pettittest, Von Neumann ratio test and bivariate test) for the meteorological time series of Turkey,and revealed that the four homogeneity tests showed the same results of the time series in most of the cases.Dikbas et al. (2O13) utilized the K-means clustering method to classify the maximum annual flows and identify the hydrological homogenous groups in Turkey. They suggested that the homogenous regions defined by the K-means clustering method can be used for regional flood frequency analysis. Seyam and Othman (2O15) analyzed the long-term variation of annual streamflow regime in the Selangor River over a 5O-year period (from 1961 to 2O1O) by using normality and homogeneity tests (including Shapiro-Wilk test and Pettitt test),and they found that the maximum annual streamflow totally increased whereas the minimum annual streamflow significantly decreased with respect to time.

In this study, we analyzed the homogeneity of the streamflow time series (over the period 1960-2010) in 14 hydrometric stations of three important basins in northwestern Iran using five absolute homogeneity tests which are mostly used in the hydro-climatic data and clustering analysis.

The clustering approach was applied to facilitate the homogeneity analysis in addition to the absolute homogeneity tests in this study.The time series usually show relatively diferent averages and variances,then it is essential to normalize the initial time series before the clustering (Kousari et al.,2O13).In this study,the hierarchical clustering was considered and the Ward's algorithm and squared Euclidean distance were preferred. The hierarchical clustering approach aims to group a set of cases in such a way that cases in the same group or cluster are more similar to each other, which leads to a minimized variance within a group or cluster (Everitt,1993; Kahya et al.,2O08). We classified the normalized streamflow time series based on the dendrograms.We also used the overall classification and qualitative interpolation of the five absolute homogeneity tests. The classfication is based on the number of the homogeneity tests which reject the null hypothesis (Wijngaard et al., 2003). ",

Furthermore,the von Neumann ratio test and Petitt test identified streamflow time series in 5 and 3 stations (out of 14 stations)as homogeneous,respectively. Based on the above-mentioned results, we inferred that the Pettittest is more sensitive than the other absolute homogeneity tests in the determination of homogeneity of the streamflow time series.As a good consequence, the results of thefive homogeneity tests determined that streamflow time series in the stations located in the east of the study area or within the ULB were mostly found to be homogeneous. In contrast,the annual streamflow series of allstations located in the ARB and SRB were inhomogeneous.The streamflow time series in the three stations of the ULB namely Ghermizi Gol, Lighvan and Sari Ghamish stations were identified as homogeneous by all homogeneity tests. Generally,since the absolute homogeneity tests have different sensitivities to the variability and changes of the data series in a given station,then the outputs of the tests sometimes have discrepancies. These discrepancies were also suggested by Wijngaard et al. (2003),Feng et al. (2004), Sahin and Cigizoglu (2010) and Hosseinzadeh Talaee et al. (2014). ",

Since these curves did not show a spatial distribution in the study area, then the distributions of various clusters of specific streamflow time series were mapped in Figure 4.The results showed that most of the streamflow time series were in the first cluster. For the monthly streamflow series,we found that only Estoor station was in the third cluster in January, April, May, November and December. As mentioned earlier, the number of inhomogeneity of the streamflow time series was more in the third cluster than in the first and second clusters.The results indicated that the clustering time series could identify the homogeneity of the streamflow time series in most of the stations. Homogeneity tests determined that most of the streamflow time series in the Estoor station were inhomogeneous.Meanwhile, most of the streamflow time series in this station were classfied in the third cluster which showed high fluctuations and inhomogeneity. All time series of streamflow except for February in the Estoor and Pol Dokhtar stations were classified in the second and third clusters. Furthermore, inhomogeneity was also detected in most of the streamflow time series in the stations by the five absolute homogeneity tests. ",

The droughts occurred in the 199Os were more devastating to water resources and agriculture,resulting in accelerated urbanization (Agrawala et al.,2001; Yazdani and Haghsheno, 2O08).According to the study of Raziei et al. (2OO9),over half of population in Iran has been affected by prolonged droughts in the 199Os.Nikbakht et al.(2013) and Tabari et al. (2O13) analyzed the streamflow droughts in northwestern Iran and found the most severe streamflow scarcities in the 199Os.The decreasing trend of the streamflow time series in the study area can be considered as an important reason of inhomogeneities in most of the stations.
