        "text": "The Affeck-Dine (AD） mechanism [3] is a promising scenario for baryogenesis. It is based on the dynamics of a complex scalar field $\\phi$ called AD field carrying baryon number. In the framework of supersymmetry, AD feld can be realized as a linear combination of squark or slepton fields, which has a large expectation value during the inflationary stage. The subsequent coherent oscillation creates a large net baryon asymmetry. As the coherent oscillation of $\\phi$ is generically unstable with spatial perturbation， it condenses into nontopological solitons called Q-balls [4]. Numerical estimations show that almost all the initial baryon asymmetry of $\\phi$ is absorbed into these Q-balls. The baryonic content of the universe can arise from earlier Q-ball evaporation which transforms leptonic asymmetry into baryonic asymmetry from sphaleron efects before electroweak scale or from the later decay of the baryonic Q-ball. At the same time,if the Q-ball is nonstable and its late decay into LSP (after the freeze out of LSP) will naturally generate the dark matter content of the universe [5]. Note that in the analysis of [5], the Q-bals are assumed to decay before BBN era in order not to destruct the BBN predictions for light element abundances. However， since the recent WMAP data on light element abundances show some deviation with the BBN predictions (as discussed later), it is possible that the Q-bals may decay during the BBN era and affect the BBN predictions for light element abundances. This possbility was first noted in [6]. Such late decays are favorable if their effects on the BBN predictions can improve the fit with the observed data. Throughout this work the late-decaying Q-bals refers to the Q-balls which decay during the BBN era. ",

We used the FastBBN code [11] and adopted three families of neutrinos in getting such a $\\eta$ value which gives the best fit value of $^ 7 L i$ abundance. We assume that in this stage the ratio of the numbers of protons to neutrons produced from B-ball decays is $p / n \\approx 7$ because the baryonic content produced from B-balls reach approximate thermal equilibrium near the surface before they spread out. Taking into account the residual protons from the first stage, the ratio of the total proton number to neutron number should be larger than 7. So the proton consuming reaction is more efficient than in the first stage,which implies that during this stage $^ { 4 } H e \\ ( ^ { 3 } H e )$ synthesis efficiency is relatively lower (higher) than in the first stage. Therefore,we predict that the overall synthesis efficiency of $^ 4 H e \\ ( ^ { 3 } H e )$ is lower (higher） than the value 0.245 ( $( 1 . 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } )$ at $\\eta = 4 . 2 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 }$ .
