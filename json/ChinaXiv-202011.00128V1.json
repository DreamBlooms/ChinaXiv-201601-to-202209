        "text": "Abstract: Understanding the effects of degradation on belowground biomass (BGB) is essential for assessment of carbon budget of the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau, China. This ecosystem has been undergoing serious degradation owing to climate change and anthropogenic activities. This study examined the response of the vertical distribution of plant BGB to degradation and explored the underlying mechanisms in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. A field survey was conducted in an alpine meadow with seven sequential degrees of degradation in the Zoige Plateau on the Tibetan Plateau during the peak growing season of 2018. We measured aboveground biomass (AGB), BGB, soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), soil compaction (SCOM), soil organic carbon (SOC),soil total nitrogen (STN), soil total phosphorus (STP), soil available nitrogen (SAN),and soil available phosphorus (STP) in the $0 { - } 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layers. Our results show that degradation dramatically decreased the BGB in the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layer $( \\mathrm { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 } )$ but slightly increased the subsoil BGB. The main reason may be that the physical-chemical properties of surface soil were more sensitive to degradation than those of subsoil, as indicated by the remarked positive associations of the trade-off value of $\\mathrm { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ with SWC, SCOM, SOC, STN, SAN, and STP, as wellas the negative correlation between the trade-off value of $\\mathrm { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ and SBD in the soil layer of $\\mathrm { 0 - 1 0 ~ c m }$ . In addition, an increase in the proportion of forbs with increasing degradation degree directly afected the BGB vertical distribution. The findings suggest that the decrease in the trade-off value of $\\mathrm { B G B _ { 0 - 1 0 } }$ in response to degradation might be an adaptive strategy for the degradation-induced drought and infertile soil conditions. This study can provide theoretical support for assessing the effects of degradation on the carbon budget and sustainable development in the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau as wellas other similar ecosystems in the world.

Soil C sequestration in grasslands occurs at an estimated rate of $0 . 5 \\mathrm { P g } \\mathrm { C } / \\mathrm { a }$ globally and accounts for approximately a quarter of the world's potentially sequestered soils (Qiu et al., 2O13). The Tibetan Plateau, approximately $3 5 \\%$ of which is occupied by alpine meadows (Zheng et al., 2OoO), is equal to about $44 \\%$ of China's total grasslands and approximately $6 \\%$ of grasslands worldwide (Piao et al., 2O12). Alpine grasslands are vital to local livestock husbandry development and ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, biodiversity maintenance, and C sequestration (Li et al., 2O13; Qin et al., 2018). However, this region's grasslands are very fragile owing to the unique climate and harsh environmental conditions (Sun and Wang, 2016; Sun et al.， 2O19a). These grasslands have undergone serious degradation under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities (Harris，2010; Sun et al.， 2014; Dong et al.， 2020)， greatly threatening' local economic development and ecological security (Huo et al., 2013).

On the Tibetan Plateau, where BGB constitutes the core portion of the grassland's total primary productivity (Li et al.,2O11), the root-to-shoot ratio can be as high as 5.8 (Yang et al., 2OO9). The alpine grassland ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau is currently considered a C sink (Yang et al., 2Oo8), largely because the roots account for a notably great proportion of alpine plants (Wu et al., 2O11). Therefore, it is important to precisely estimate the root biomass and turnover rate to obtain a more reliable scientific assessment of the C budget in this terrestrial ecosystem. However, because of methodological difficulties and high cost, the distribution and transfer of a plant's BGB in response to grassland degradation is not well understood (Sun et al., 2018a). ",

        "text": "Roots serve as both the primary pathways for a plant's nutrient and water uptake (Wu et al., 2011) and its anchorage to the basement soil. As they consume resources, roots are involved in underground competition with other plants (Hortal et al., 2O17), complex mutualistic relationships with beneficial bacteria and fungi (Duran et al.， 2O18)， and competitive correlations with detrimental microbes (Rey and Schornack, 2O13). The root system's overall structure and ability to adapt to habitat conditions is called plasticity and is a crucial determinant of the overall plant adaptability (Gruber et al.,2O13; Rogers and Benfey, 2O15). For example, the roots of perennial plants in particular legumes can affect the physical properties of forcefully compacted soils (Glab and Szewczyk, 2O14). Because they enhance the water retention properties, these types of roots can be used to regenerate soils that have undergone physical degradation. However, some species have different effects on the soil environment, owing mainly to their unique root morphologies (Silva et al., 2O14). In addition, root systems affect plant growth through nutrient foraging, gaseous exchange, and absorption of beneficial microorganisms (Pieterse et al.,， 2O14; Verbon and Liberman, 2016). ",

        "text": "The main properties of the root system are as follows: length, biomass, volume, anatomy, and surface area (Lynch and Brown, 2O12). These characteristics facilitate the ability of plants to survive under various biological and abiotic stresses, including salinity, extreme temperatures, waterlogging, drought, and nutrient deficiency (Dukes et al., 2Oo5; Rodrigues et al., 2O15). Thus, roots are considered to be an important factor determining the competitive ability of individual plants under environmental stress, which affects the responses of the plant community structure to environmental changes (Haichar et al., 2Oo8). The characteristics and morphology of grass roots are closely linked to environmental conditions,and these roots tend to have highly dynamic lifespans ranging from a few days to weeks (Tingey et al., 2O1O). In addition, previous researches have revealed that the distribution of plant root biomass can be affected by various environmental factors, including soil physical-chemical and biological properties, climatic conditions, and plant characteristics (Rodriguez et al., 2007; Macinnis-Ng et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011). For instance, Zhang et al. (2O19) found that plants allocate more root biomass to deeper soils for maintaining plant water acquisition and growth in response to drought stress. As grassland degradation induces dynamics in the soil water, nutrients, microenvironment, and plant properties, the BGB distribution patterns might also fluctuate during degradation. There is litle available information on the variation of the direction and magnitude of BGB distribution patterns in response to degradation of alpine meadows. We hypothesized that BGB in topsoil but not subsoil may be more vulnerable to degradation because surface soil loses water and nutrients relatively quickly compared with subsoil. ",

These findings could be atributed to the following factors. First, the degradation-induced reductions in vegetation biomass and coverage not only decrease the soil organic mater (SOM) input (Wang et al., 2O09), but also enhance water and soil erosion, resulting in nutrient losses (Zhu et al., 2011; Dlamini et al., 2014). Second, changes in the microenvironment (e.g.， SWC and SBD) along the degradation gradients increase the dissolution of SOM (Wang et al.， 2O08). Third, the degradation-induced turnover of species composition, for example, the ongoing replacement of grasses by ruderal species during grassland degradation,can affect the fixed soil C content (Wu et al., 2O14; Han et al., 2O18). Finally, changes in litter can have important effects on the variation of SOC (Mehta et al., 2O13) and STN (Che et al., 2018). Specifically, degradation reduces the C and nitrogen (N) storage by changing the quantity and quality of litter input to the soil (Sun et al., 2O18a). ",

The reason might be the negative effects of retrogression on the soil water-holding capacity (Fu et al., 2O15) and an increase in evaporation owing to strong radiation due to degradation-induced plant cover reduction (Wang et al., 2O09). Additionally, the decrease in SCOM with increasing degradation degree indicates that degradation causes the soil to be less cohesive by reducing the clay content and increasing the silt content (Yi et al., 2O12). Notably， most of the soil physical-chemical properties were more vulnerable to degradation in the upper soil layer i $( 0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } )$ than in the subsoil layers (10-20 and $2 0 { - } 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } )$ (Table 1). Other works have reported similar behavior (Bardgett et al., 2OO5; Pan et al., 2O17), which indicates that the impacts of degradation on the soil characteristics appear primarily in the upper soil layer. The reason is probably that degradation-induced decreases in vegetation cover and root grasp directly expose the surface soil to wind, rainfall, and surface flow (Pan et al., 2017). ",

The unique environmental conditions on the Tibetan Plateau, such as high soil rigidity and permafrost, might contribute to the depth dependence (Li et al., 2O11). Of most interest to our study, the trade-off value of BGB in the 0-10 cm soil layer $\\left( \\mathbf { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 } \\right)$ decreased dramatically along the degradation gradients.

There is an apparent positive association between the trade-off value of $\\mathbf { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ and SCOM in the topsoil (Fig. 6), which suggests that individual deeply rooted plants provide resilience against large gale-force winds in cohesionless soil (Vo and Johnson, 2OO1). Moreover, soil with higher SBD is generally less porous; consequently, root respiration and microbial activities, and thus root growth,are limited (Yan et al., 2O18), which is reflected in the negative correlation between the trade-off value of $\\mathbf { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ and $\\mathrm { S B D } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ (SBD in the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layer) (Fig. 6). Additionally, SWC,which is tightly linked to nutrient availability， plays an important role in plant physiological activities (e.g., transpiration) and strongly afects plant growth (Swift et al., 2004). The significant positive correlation between the trade-off value of $\\mathbf { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ and ${ \\bf S W C } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ (SWC in the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layer) in our study (Fig. 6) indicated that deeper-rooted plants could use water from the subsoil when soil water in the upper soil decreased dramatically with increasing degradation degree (Hu et al., 2013).

Our results showed a dramatic decrease in AGB of graminoids and a slight increase in AGB of forbs with increasing degradation degree (Fig. 3). This finding suggests that plant communities tend to shift from graminoids to forbs after degradation occurs, showing successive vegetation reversal with the degradation of the plant community structure (Wang et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2OO9). This result is mainly because that the main cause of grassland degradation in our study site is free grazing, and selective foraging decreases the proportion of palatable graminoids. Moreover, forbs show a stronger competitive capacity than graminoids in the increasingly hostile environment resulting from increasing degradation degree (Sun et al., 2OO9; Han et al., 2011). Graminoids have shallow roots that extend horizontally in the surface soil, whereas forbs produce deep axial roots (Wang et al., 2O04), which contribute directly to the reduction in the root biomass in the topsoil, as indicated by the significant positive correlation between the trade-off value of $\\mathbf { B G B } _ { 0 - 1 0 }$ and AGB(G/F) (Fig. 6).

Our findings suggest that alpine grassland degradation dramatically reduces belowground net primary production in the topsoil owing to degradation-induced deterioration of soil conditions and changes in the plant community structure. These results can provide valuable information for scientific assessment of the effects of degradation on the soil C pool distribution in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau and similar areas worldwide. Larger-scale transect surveys should be used in future studies to further explore the general response of root biomass distribution to grassland degradation. ",
