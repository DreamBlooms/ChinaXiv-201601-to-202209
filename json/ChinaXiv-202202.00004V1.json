        "text": "Abstract: Leaf wetness provides a wide range of benefits not only to leaves, but also to ecosystems and communities. It regulates canopy eco-hydrological processes and drives spatial differences in hydrological flux. In spite of these functions,litle remains known about the spatial distribution of leaf wetness under different soil water conditions.Leaf wetness measurements at the top $\\mathrm { 1 8 0 ~ c m } \\rangle$ ，middle $( 1 3 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m } )$ ，and bottom $( 8 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m } )$ of the canopy positions of rainfed jujube (Zizipbus jujuba Mil.) in the Chinese loess hilly region were obtained along with meteorological and soil water conditions during the growing seasons in 2019 and 2020. Under soil water non-deficit condition,the frequency of occurrence of leaf wetness was $5 . 4 5 \\%$ higher at the top than at the middle and botom of the canopy positions. The frequency of occurrence of leaf wetness at the top, middle and bottom of the canopy positions was over $80 \\%$ at 17:00-18:0O (LST). However, the occurrence of leaf wetness at the top was earlier than those at the middle and bottom of the canopy positions. Correspondingly, leaf drying at the top was also lattr than those at the middle and bottom of the canopy positions.Leaf wetness duration at the middle was similar to that at the bottom of the canopy position,but about $1 . 4 6 { - } 3 . 0 1 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ less than that at the top. Under soil Water deficit condition, the frequency of occurrence of leaf wetness $( 4 . 9 2 \\% - 4 5 . 4 5 \\% )$ followed the order of top>middle $>$ bottom of the canopy position.As the onset of leaf wetness was delayed,the onset of wet leaf drying was advanced and the leaf wetness duration was shortened.Leaf wetness duration at the top was linearly related $( R ^ { 2 } { > } 0 . 7 0 )$ to those at the middle and bottom of the canopy positions under diferent soil water conditions. In conclusion,the hydrological processes at canopy surfaces of rainfed jujube depended on the position of leaves, thus adjusting canopy structure to redistribute hydrological process is a way to meet the water need of jujube.

Although triggered by several forms of precipitation,leaf wetness is mainly driven by dew in arid areas (Jacobs et al., 2Oo6;Magarey et al.,2OO6).In arid and semi-arid areas, dew is a common and significant source of water, accounting for $4 . 5 \\% - 7 7 . 0 \\%$ of the total precipitation (Hanisch et al.,2O15; Zhuang and Zhao,2O17).

It is not only a parameter expressing leaf wetness, but is also an index that can be used to reflect plant function,such as leaching,deposition, energy balance and reproduction (Sentelhas et al., 2004; Dawson and Goldsmith,2O18). LWD affects the susceptibility of plants to pathogens and primary productivity of agro-ecosystem (Kim et al., 2O1O). Measurement and modeling are two methods of obtaining LWD (Kim et al., 2010; Rowlandson et al., 2015). However, no uniform standard currently exists for measuring LWD (Tomaszkiewicz et al.,2O15),and simulation results from models are sensitive to the changes in input parameters (Sentelhas et al., 2Oo8).Parameters with different time steps can induce uncertainties and errors in model results (Zito et al., 2020).

Only a few studies monitored LWD at different canopy positions (Igarashi et al., 2018). In fact, due to complex canopy structure and variable canopy micro-meteorology, canopy wetness is variable in both time and space (Bassmba et al., 2O17; Binks et al.,2021).Modeled or measured LWD at the top of canopy or at other canopy positions cannot fully reflect the overall state of leaf wetness (Binks et al.,2O21). Moreover,there have been only a few studies on the distribution of canopy wetness in forest ecosystem (Aparecido et al., 2O16). Additionall, climate change significantly affects LWD.For example,LWD caused by dew is highly sensitive to relative humidity and temperature (Monteith,1957),and climate warming will reduce LWD in arid and semi-arid areas (Vuollekoski et al.,2O15; Feng et al.,2O21). Under the effects of climate change,reduced LWD will affect water use and energy distribution at different canopy positions, resulting in significant impacts on the ecosystem's function (Berry et al.， 2O18; Dawson and Goldsmith，2O18). Therefore,predicting the capacity of ecosystem's function may be largely dependent on an understanding of the spatial variations in leaf wetness (Binks et al., 2021). ",

It has been widely cultivated under rainfed conditions in the semi-arid loess hilly region of China for thousands of years. Because it is highly drought-tolerant and has considerable economic benefits, jujube is the main economic plantation in the loess hilly region,covering an area of $1 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \\ \\mathrm { h m } ^ { \\tilde { 2 } }$ (Liu et al., 2013；Chen et al.， 2O15).Because rainfall cannot completely meet the water demands of vegetation in this region,soil desiccation has become the dominant hydrological phenomenon (Wang et al.,2O15). The mechanisms of water use and regulation in jujube in dry soils have been widely studied (Liu et al.,2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chen et al.,2015; Chen et al., 2016; Nie et al., 2017;Ma et al., 2O19; Chen et al.,202O).Recent studies have shown that dew has a positive eco-hydrological effect on dryland jujube (Gao et al., 2O2Ob). Dew is a critical potential water source making considerable contributions to the canopy energy budget (Magarey et al., 2006). Under dry soil conditions,however,the spatial distribution of leaf wetness at different jujube canopy positions remains unclear. Clarification of this spatial distribution can deepen insight into the hydrological processes at the canopy level, thereby guiding water management decisions in jujube and other similar crop plantations.Thus,the objectives of this study were to: (1） analyze the state and dynamics of leaf wetness at different jujube canopy positions; (2） explore the duration of leaf wetness at diferent canopy positions; and (3) find the relationship between these two above parameters.

These sensors are made up of different materials and also operated on different principles (Dalla Marta and Orlandini, 2010). Thus,there is no unified standard for measuring leaf wetness (Kaseke et al., 2O17). Leaf wetness is often caused by dew,and the necessary condition for dew is for surface temperature to be lower than the dew-point temperature. However， differences in dew duration measurements are attributed to the differences in time when the surface temperature of the instrument reaches or falls below the dew-point temperature.In fact, there are biases in some measuring instruments. In this study, the dielectric Leaf Wetness Sensor (LWs, Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) was used to measure leaf wetness of jujube.LWS has similar thermodynamic characteristics with real leaf blades and therefore can measure blade weting time more accurately than other instruments (Ghobakhlou et al.,2O16). Visual and tactile observation methods (Sentelhas et al., 2004; Rowlandson et al.,2O15) were used to check LWS.The threshold value of LWS sensor was set at 455 raw counts because this value most correctly reflected jujube leaf wetness in the study. When LWS wetness threshold was greater than 455 raw counts,leaves were wet, and when it was less than 455 raw counts,leaves were dry (Gao et al., 2020a). ",

When leaves are wet, the thin water layer or water droplets will be formed on the surfaces of wet leaves,these water can serve as a supplementary water source for plants and be absorbed by leaves (Dawson and Goldsmith,2O18). Kidron and Starinsky(2O19) found that water stored in leaves is mainly a $\\mathrm { C a S O _ { 4 } }$ water type,with a total dissolved ion (TDI) range of $8 8 { - } 7 5 8 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ ,the ionic composition of the water stored in leaves is generally higher than that of rain,and the absorption of these water by leaves is not affected by the amount of dew,but by the LWD (Kidron and Starinsky,2O19). Our results showed that LWD was higher at the top than at the middle and bottom of the canopy positions (Fig. 5). This observation is consistent with those of previous studies on LWD for rainforest, apple, soybean, grape and corn plantations (Sentelhas et al.,2005; Batzer et al., 2008; Lulu et al., 2008; Schmitz and Grant,2O09; Binks et al.,2O21). Our results are,however, different from those obtained for the studies on coffee,cotton and banana plantations (Sentelhas et al., 2Oo5; Santos et al., 2008). On the one hand,longtime leaf wetness can make water move into the leaves (Burkhardt et al., 2012).At the same time, nutrients was absorped by plant leaves (Fernandez and Eichert, 2009). On the other hand,water absorbed by leaves can promote cell expansion by increasing turgor pressure,thereby promoting stem and leaf growth (Dawson and Goldsmith, 2O18). Thus,leaf wetness affects not only the plant physiology but also the canopy microclimate. ",

For example,grape leaves growing in southwest usually start to wet earlier and dry later than those growing in northeast (Lulu et al., 2008).Also, tomato leaves growing in east dried $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ later than those growing in north,south and west (Lau et al.,2OOO).LWD of citrus was higher on the west side than on the east side (Bassmba et al.,2Ol7),but our result showed that in the north there was a significant linear correlation between LWD at different canopy positions of jujube.

(2OO8) found that overhanging leaves of trees such as apple create a barrier that reduces loss of radiant and convective heat from the ground,and delays cooling of surfaces in the lower canopy. Thus, overhanging leaves can delay the formation of dew in the lower canopy, making LWD lower at the lower position than at the top position.When leaf temperature in open positions falls below the dew-point temperature up to $6 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ in night, understory leaves remain below the dew-point temperature for only $^ { \\textrm { 1 h } }$ (Brewer and Smith,1997).Rowlandson et al. (2015) observed that when planting density was low,the whole plant undergoes radiative cooling at almost the same rate. Thus,dew deposition is more uniform with no time difference of leaf wetness at different canopy layers.For example,the leaf wetness of tomato starts at the top and then to the botom.Drying of leaf has the similar trend (Jacobs et al., 2Oo9). However, dwarf jujube has a dense spacing, with a similar canopy structure of apple.Here,LWD was higher at the top than at the middle and bottom of the canopy positions (Fig.5). Moreover, leaf wetness started earlier at the top than at the middle and bottom of the canopy positions. Drying of leaf wetness occurred later at the top than at the middle and bottom of the canopy positions (Fig. 4; Table 2). ",

Climate factors such as RH and T are primary factors driving leaf wetness in jujube plantation (Gao et al., 2O2Oa). However, RH and T at different canopy positions of jujube plants were similar under the same soil water condition. The maximum difference of temperature between the top and bottom of the canopy positions was $0 . 3 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and the maximum difference of RH was $1 . 7 2 \\%$ (Fig.3). Soil water deficit reduced the frequency of occurrence of leaf wetness in rainfed jujube，which is consistent with previous results (Rowlandson et al., 2015; Kaseke et al., 2017; Aguirre-Gutierrez et al., 2019). Figure 4 showed that the relative days of leaf wetness in jujube under soil water deficit condition was $1 6 . 4 3 \\% - 2 4 . 2 2 \\%$ less than that under soil water non-deficit condition. Soil water affected LWD in rainfed jujube,with LWDs at the top, middle and bottom of the canopy positions under soil water non-deficit condition of $0 . 5 6 { - } 4 . 9 4 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ higher than those under deficit condition.Even with less rainfall and low soil water,the differences in LWD under different soil water conditions were obvious (Fig.5). However, soil water is not a limiting factor in humid areas or in areas with dense planting,and water vapor source causing leaf wetness mainly comes from the atmosphere rather than the soil. Wen et al. (2Ol2) found that dew water in densely spaced crops and grasses (Stipa klinderi, Agropyrus aestivum and Frigida frigida) came from the atmosphere $( 9 8 \\% )$ at the top and only $2 \\%$ dew water originated from soil evaporation.

Future studies should analyze the mechanisms of water use from leaf wetness at different positions. In conclusion, the hydrological processes at canopy surfaces of rainfed jujube depended on the position of leaves, thus adjusting canopy structure to redistribute hydrological process is a way to meet the water need of jujube.
