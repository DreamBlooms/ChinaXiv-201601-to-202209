The moderate acidity could promote the conversion of 1-butene to 2-butene,and consequently the catalyst showed higher 1-butene conversion and propene selectivity.At low Si/Al ratios, the W-Al-KIT-6-1 catalyst exhibited high acidity and deteriorated structure.The poor texture resulted in low1-butene conversion and the high acidity stimulated unwanted side-reaction such as, isomerization or oligomerization reactions,resulting in low propene selectivity and bad stability.W-Al-KIT-6-10 catalystwith an optimum amount of Al showed the best catalytic performance due to the highly dispersed W species and suitable acidity.

When Al/Si ratios ranged from1/30 to $1 / 1 0$ ,W-Al-KIT-6 catalysts showed enhanced catalytic performance.The introduction of excessive Al resulted in the collapse of the mesoporous structures of KIT-6 and poor catalytic performance.The improvement of catalytic activity was ascribed to the retained mesoporous structure,the increased amountofacid sitesand the better dispersion of W species facilitated by Al incorporation.The introduction of excess Al resulted in the collapse of mesoporous structure and poor catalytic performance.The findings in this study are helpful to design more efficient metathesis catalysts for propene productionand could be extended to other olefin metathesis reactions.
