Contrary to what has been widely accepted, the contributions of $P$ wave $B$ mesons are generally the largest, and to some extent, this result is independent of the potential parameters.We also push the calculation beyond $B ( 1 P )$ and carefully analyze the contributions of $B ( 2 S )$ . A form factor is a key ingredient to suppress the contributions of $B ( 2 S )$ for low lying bottomonia.However,this suppression mechanism is not effcient for highly excited bottomonia, such as $\\Upsilon ( 5 S )$ and $\\Upsilon ( 6 S )$ . We give explanations why this difficulty happens to the $^ { 3 } P _ { 0 }$ model and suggest analyzing the flux-tube breaking model for the full calculation of coupled-channel effects. ",

Despite the success of QCD in the high energy region，due to asymptotic freedom，the nonperturbative effect dominates at low energies and brings problems to perturbative calculation. One tool to study this non-perturbative efect is lattce QCD. However,due to its huge calculation work,it is stillunable to calculate all the physical quantities with the current computation power. Another important approach is to develop various phenomenological models.Among these phenomenological models,the quark model is a prominent one. Under the quark model framework, various types of interactions have been suggested by various groups,and they have achieved many impressive successes (see e.g. Refs. [2-6]). However, these potential models cannot be the whole story. One important missing ingredient is the mechanism to generate quark-antiquark pairs which enlarge the Fock space of the initial state,i.e.,the initial state contains multiquark components. These multiquark components will change the Hamiltonian of the potential model, causing mass shift and mixing between states with the same quantum numbers or directly contributing to an open channel strong decay if the initial state is above the corresponding threshold. These consequences can be summarized as unquenched effects or coupled-channel effects. ",

One is that the threshold corresponding to the excited $B$ mesons is higher than the ground state $B B$ threshold; thus the coupled-channel effects is expected to be small. Another is that the calculations of the excited $B$ mesons' contributions are more complicated,an effective method to do the calculation is still not widely known. ",

Given the fact that the quantum numbers of $B _ { 1 }$ are different from the ground state $B$ mesons, and the coupled-channel effects do rely on the quantum numbers,the suppression purely originates from the larger mass may be not as large as what has been taken for granted.

Because the mass of $b$ quark is very large, it is safe to assume that the heavy quark spin symmetry does not break. Under this limit, it is reasonable to set the mass of $B _ { 0 } ( ^ { 3 } P _ { 0 } )$ and missing partner of $B _ { 1 } ( 5 7 2 1 )$ to be the same as $B _ { 1 } ( 5 7 2 1 )$ . There is a mixing between $B ( ^ { 3 } P _ { 1 } )$ and $B ( ^ { 1 } P _ { 1 } )$ to form the experimentally observed $B _ { 1 } ( 5 7 2 1 )$ [39]. However, since we sum up all the possible combinations of $B$ mesons,mixing between the two $1 ^ { + } B$ mesons can also be neglected. As far the mass of the intermediate states are well measured, we use the value from the Particle Data Group [39]. ",
