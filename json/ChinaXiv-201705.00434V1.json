In fact,the significant improvement of toughening PLA starts from using compatibilizer[15].After many attempts,for instance，using triphenyl phosphite（TPP）[16], epoxide soybean oil [17], tung oil anhydride [18],epoxidized itaconic acid[19],epoxidized cardanol [2O],epoxidized citric acid [21],etc,the interfacial adhesion between PLAand the modifier is improved and thus enhances the toughness.But,compatibilizer is not usually a good choice.Generally, the molecular weight of compatibilizer is low and thus results in unexpected exudation to extremely reduce the overall mechanical properties.

The tensile-fractured surfaces of PLA/PBC blends showa little bit rougher with some cavities and some thick rods,which is formed by the removal of PBC and the deformed PBC phases. According to the study of Kim [36],when the phase adhesion between the modifier particles and the matrix is good,the plastic deformation occurs via single cavitation processes inside modifier particles,whereas when there is no or poor phase adhesion,the micromechanical deformation processes are followed by debonding.Since PBC phase prefers to be removed by tensile stress rather than deformed,the compatibility and interfacial adhesion between PBC and PLA are weak.However,the tensile-fractured surfaces of PLA/PBAC exhibit highly elongated deformation formed bythe deformation of PBAC，indicating the high interfacial compatibility between PBAC and PLA.Due to the large deformation, a great deal of energy can be absorbed,thus producesa rather high toughness.Finally, tough property in terms of the tensile elongation is obviously improved with the addition of PBAC.

It is obvious that, even with $1 0 \\%$ PBAC,brittle-to-tough transition occurs in PLA/PBAC blends.Really tough PLA/PBAC blend is fabricated.In conclusion, thereare two key factors to decide the effect of toughening.The first is the compatibility between polyesterand PLA.The second is the rigid molecular chain but “non-rigid”aggregation structure (Fig. 6). Our previous researches [28,29,37] noticed non-planar ring contained polyesters are particular tough.For one thing，their molecular chain is more rigid than polyesters with aliphatic molecular chain. For the other, incorporating the cis non-planar ring can disrupt the crystalline region and thus releases the strong intrinsic entropic elasticity of the molecular chain.That is to say,if the aggregation structure of the polyester is“non-rigid\",it is very helpful to exhibit the intrinsic entropic elasticity of the rigid molecular chain.Detailed explanation can be seen in Ref.[37]. So the toughness of PLA can be improved due to the flexibility of the“nonrigid”aggregation structure,and the stability of therigid chains. This understanding provides us an important principle to design and fabricate non-planar ring contained polyester to modify PLA with the aim to pursue high toughness. ",
