        "text": "Abstract: Sand fences made of punched steel plate (PSP) have recently been applied to control wind-blown sand in desertified and Gobi areas due to their strong wind resistance and convenient in situ construction. However, few studies have assessd the protective efect of PSP sand fences,especially through field observations.This study analyzes the effects of double-row PSP sand fences on wind and sand resistance using field observations and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical simulation. The results of field observations showed that the average windproof eficiencies of the first-row and second-row sand fences were $7 9 . 8 \\%$ and $70 . 8 \\%$ ，respectively. Moreover， the average windproof efficiencies of the numerical simulation behind the first-row and second-row sand fences were $89 . 8 \\%$ and $8 1 . 1 \\%$ ,respectively. The sand-resistance efficiency of the double-row PSP sand fences was $6 5 . 4 \\%$ . Sand deposition occurred close to the first-row sand fence;however,there was relatively litle sand on the leeward side of the second-row sand fence.The length of sand accumulation near PSP sand fences obtained by numerical simulation was basically consistent with that through field observations, indicating that field observations combined with numerical simulation can provide insight into the complex wind-blown sand field over PSP sand fences. This study indicates that the protection effciency of the double-row PSP sand fences is sufficient for effective control of sand hazards associated with extremely strong wind in the Gobi areas. The output of this work is expected to improve the future application of PSP sand fences. ",

        "text": "In recent years,a variety of sand-resistant materials (polyethylene (PE） mesh, nylon mesh, plug-in concrete walls,sleeper-style windscreens,etc.） suitable for the aeolian environment have been applied in sand-control engineering,especially in China (Yang et al.，2O2O)；and much experience pertaining to sand control under different conditions has been attained. Specifically, sand fences made of PE and nylon mesh are more sensitive to wind velocity,and are generally used in low-wind energy areas where velocity is lower than $1 0 \\mathrm { m / s }$ (Yang et al., 2020). Wang et al. (1999) conducted a wind tunnel test to assess the protection efficiency of white nylon mesh and ultraviolet (UV)-resistant mesh sand fences on the Tarim Desert Highway, China.They revealed that the porosity of white nylon mesh sand fence was $64 \\%$ ,and wind velocity on the leeward side of the fence was approximately $20 \\%$ lower than the initial wind velocity,while the porosity of UV-resistant nylon mesh sand fence was $58 \\%$ .Qu et al. (2OO1) found that wind velocity on the leeward side of a sand fence was $30 \\%$ lower than the initial wind velocity,and sand deposition efficiency of a nylon mesh sand fence with a porosity of $4 0 \\% - 4 5 \\%$ was $50 \\%$ under extreme wind velocity $( 2 4 ~ \\mathrm { m / s } )$ . In high wind energy areas,especially in high-altitude plateaus, sand fences such as plug-in concrete walls and sleeper-style windscreens are often used for railway protection from wind-blown sand (Bruno et al.,2018a, b). Yang et al. (2O2O) studied the sand control effects of different types of sand-resistant measures using wind tunnel tests. They found that plug-in concrete walls and sleeper-style windscreens are the least sensitive to wind velocity,and the wind-proof efficiency of sand fences is the highest under high wind velocity (Huang et al., 2019). However, due to the large pore spacing of plug-in concrete wals and sleeper-style windscreens, sand accumulation on the railway line on the lee side of the windshield wall remained serious, indicating the low sand-resistance efficiency of the windshield (Huang et al.,2O19). In addition, plug-in concrete walls and sleeper-style windscreens have many disadvantages， such as inconvenient transport, tedious construction,and poor economic efficiency. In contrast, punched steel plate (PSP) sand fences proposed in recent years are made of a new type of sand-resistant material, and can be conveniently and quickly installed during the construction process.Wang et al.(2018) tested the protection provided by PSP sand fences using wind tunnel experiments,and found that windproof and sand-resistance efficiencies of the single-row and double-row PSP sand fences were greater than $70 \\%$ and $80 \\%$ ，respectively，indicating that PSP sand fences could effectively control sand hazards caused by extremely strong wind in the Gobi areas. However, to date,only wind tunnel tests have been conducted to assess the protective effect of PSP sand fences,and verification through field observation data is lacking. Due to space limitations, wind tunnel tests hardly produce the correct geometry, kinematics,and dynamics simultaneously (Li and Sherman, 2O15). Therefore,the results of wind and sand flow around sand fences are quite different from those in the field (Hagen et al.,1981). ",

The inlet wind velocity profile was obtained by Equation 5;and the reference wind velocity at a specified height of $2 \\mathrm { m }$ was $1 0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ ，which was equal to the measured wind data.To simplify the calculation, we judged the wind profile to be similar to the wind profile on the open natural ground (Wakes et al.,2O1O; Jackson et al., 2011). The aerodynamic roughness length $z _ { 0 }$ and friction wind velocity were $0 . 8 7 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and $0 . 4 9 7 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ respectively, which were estimated from the wind profile of the reference anemometer array using the method of Bauer et al.

The wall function requirement on dimensionless wall unit $3 0 < n ^ { + } < 2 0 0$ (Blocken et al., 2007).The grid convergence index method was used for grid sensitivity analysis and discrete error estimation (Celik et al.,2O08; Tan et al., 2O16).An important integral parameter for the horizontal wind velocity at $2 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ above the ground was studied as the simulation objective.We chose three meshes for analysis,and took three values of $n _ { w }$ ，namely $n _ { w } = 0 . 0 0 1 2 5 \\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ ， $0 . 0 0 1 5 \\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ and $0 . 0 0 3 \\mathrm { ~ H ~ }$ ，where $n _ { w }$ is the height of the adjacent wall cell $( \\mathrm { m } )$ .

The backflow zone was affected by the airflow passing through the holes of the first-row sand fence, and gradually disappeared. The velocity increased to a maximum value at approximately $2 . 5 \\mathrm { H }$ in front of the second-row sand fence.The maximum velocities at O.2 and $1 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ above the ground were 2.5 and $3 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ ,respectively,and decreased rapidly under the influence of the second-row sand fence.A small backflow zone formed beyond the second-row sand fence.The length of the backflow zone was approximately $4 . 9 \\mathrm { H }$ ，and the maximum value of $\\mathrm { V x } / \\mathrm { V _ { H } }$ in the recirculation Zone was O.O6.Finally,the wind velocity gradually returned to its initial state.Within the height range of the double-row PSP sand fences,the wind velocity variation showed a W-shaped distribution (i.e.，decreasing,increasing，and returning to the initial velocity along the flow direction).

In a field experiment, the inherent variability in sand transport and the turbulence around the sand fence improved the variability of sand-resistance efficiency (Wilson and Yee，2003). Changes in wind direction during sand transport further increase the uncertainty of the sand flux density,and variations in the angle between the airflow and the sand fence change the shear force of the sand grain surface on the leeward side of the sand fence. However, studying multi-row sand fences in a wind tunnel is difficult,because the size of sand grains,the length of saltation,and the aperture size of the sand fences are limited after scaling the sand fence.The differences in the saltation height and length scale of sand grains in the wind tunnel versus in the field create additional complexity.
