        "text": "Drought stress has adverse impacts on plant production and productivity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one class of noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally.In this study, we employed small RNA and degradome sequencing to systematically investigate the tissuespecific miRNAs responsible to drought stress,which are understudied in tomato.For this purpose,root and upground tissues of two different drought-responsive tomato genotypes (Lycopersicon esculentum as sensitive and L.esculentum var.cerasiforme as tolerant) were subjected to stress with $5 \\%$ polyethylene glycol for 7 days.A total of 699 conserved miRNAs belonging to 578 families were determined and 688 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between different treatments,tissues and genotypes. Using degradome sequencing, 44 target genes were identified associated with 36 miRNA families.Drought-related miRNAs and their targets were enriched functionally by Gene Ontology (GO)and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses.Totally,53 miRNAs targeted 23 key drought stress-and tissue development-related genes,including DRP (dehydration-responsive protein), GTs (glycosyltransferases),ERF (ethylene responsive factor),PSl (photosystem Il) protein,HD-ZIP (homeodomain-leucine zipper),MYB and NAC-domain transcription factors.miR160,miR165, miR166,miR171,miR398,miR408,miR827,miR9472,miR9476 and miR9552 were the key miRNAs functioning in regulation of these genes and involving in tomato response to drought stress.Additionally，plant hormone signal transduction pathway genes were differentially regulated by miR169,miR172,miR393,miR5641,miR5658 and miR7997 in both tissues of both sensitive and tolerant genotypes.These results provide new insight into the regulatory role of miRNAs in drought response with plant hormone signal transduction and drought-tolerant tomato breeding.

Small RNAs，especially microRNAs (miRNAs)，regulate abiotic stress-related gene expression post-transcriptionally，down-regulating their target genes，while their expression changes conversely (Carrington and Ambros,20o3；Ding et al.，2013; Sunkar，2010；Zhang，2015；Zhang and Wang，2015).Many miRNAs response to drought stress via signal transduction pathways such as auxin signalling，ABA-mediated regulation, Osmoprotectant biosynthesis and scavenging of antioxidants (Ding et al.，2013).Drought-related miRNAs and their targets havebeen identifiedin different plants such as Arabidopsis (Liu et al.，2008;Sunkar and Zhu，2004),cotton (Xie et al.，2015), switchgrass (Xie et al.,2014) rice (Zhao et al.,2007; Zhou et al., 2010）and soya bean (Kulcheski et al.，2011)． However，no systematical study has been performed on tomato.

        "text": "Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) isan economically important crop due to demand for fresh vegetable market and processed food industry worldwide(Klee andGiovannoni, 2011).Tomato contains strong antioxidant enzymes,high level of lycopene,rich iron content,and vitamins A and C (Rai et al., 2013).Tomato is also one of the most favoured models for fleshly fruit ripening and epigenetic researches (Gonzalez et al.,2013; Klee and Giovannoni，2011).Tomato growth，productivity and nutritional quality are generally affected by environmental stress factors such as drought,salt,flooding and pathogen infection (Rai et al.,2013).Cultivated tomatoes (L.esculentum) are known assensitive to drought at all stages of plant development,while seed germination and early seedling stages are mostly affected (Foolad et al.，20o3).However，their wild types such as L. pimpinellifolium，L.pennellii,L.chilense and L.esculentumvar. cerasiforme are drought-tolerant species (Sadashiva et al.,2013). Researches are in progress to clarify molecular pathways on drought response of plants (Sadashiva et al.,2013),and miRNAs can be alternatives to identify drought metabolism,as they play crucial role on abiotic stress response regulating the stress-related mRNAs (Kumar,2014). Determination and functional characterization of stress-related miRNAs and target identification are important in breedingprogrammes and can contribute to developing new strategies for improving stress tolerance (Barrera-Figueroa et al.，2o13).Although several studies have been performed on tomato miRNAs (Cao et al.，2014; Feng et al., 2014;Karlova et al.,2013;Korir et al.,2013;Moxon et al.,2008; Pilcher et al.,2oo7),there is no study on genomewide droughtresponsive miRNA identification of tomato in tissue-specific manner.

In our study,we found 44 target genes,but only the targets of 4 miRNAs (sly-miR156,slymiR160，sly-miR166 and sly-miR482)were matched with their results (Table S4).We identified not only the common targets as reported previously but also new targets in tomato.Forexample, miR156 targets SBP transcription factors，but sly-miR156d-3p targeted NAD(H)-like kinase protein,while sly-miR156e-5p targeted four genes including SBP6 and PSll protein.Except the previous report that miR16O was found to target ARF10,ARF16 and ARF17 (Karlova et al.，2013),we also found that miR160 targeted ARF18-like and PSll protein (Table S4).Several other drought-related miRNAs targeted several new genes.

For example,miR165/166 families were known to target HD-ZIP II transcription factor which is crucial for leaf polarity,lateral root development and vascular patterning (Elhiti and Stasolla，2009; Williams et al.,2005;Zhong and Ye,2007).The expressions of miR165/166 family were generally decreased by drought treatment in other plant species such as rice (Zhou et al.，2010), cotton (Xie et al.,2015),wheat (Kantar et al.,2011) and peach (Eldem et al.，2012).However，the expression of miR166 was increasedin Medicago truncatula by drought stress and the expression level was higher in roots in comparison with upper parts (Trindade et al.，201O).Moreover，overexpressionsof miR165/166causedformationsofvascularbundlesand decreased lateral roots, respectively (Boualem et al.,2oo8; Zhong and Ye，2007).These results suggest that miR165/166 families regulate root development and drought response.In our study, drought majorly induced the expression of miR165,but inhibited theexpression of miR166 in roots.Additionally,sly-miR165a-5p/ miR166k and sly-miR165b-5p were root specific in sensitive and tolerant genotypes，respectively，whereas sly-miR166d-5p was specific to upground tissues of tolerant genotype.Drought did not affect the sensitive genotype significantly in miR165 family. However,in root tissues of tolerant genotype,the expression of miR165b-5p was decreased by $- 8 . 2 5$ -foldafterdroughttreatment，whereas miR165a-3p was up-regulated (3.10-fold) in upground tissues.

Consistently， the overexpression ofmiR398 led to downregulation of CSD1 and 2 enzymes and caused sensitivity to drought stress in rice (Lu et al., 2010). Our target identification results were consistent with the literature and sly-miR398a-3p targeted CSD enzyme also (Table S3). However,sly-miR398a-3p expression did not change significantly by drought (Figure 3, Table S2)． Sly-miR398a-5p was down-regulated in sensitive upground and tolerant root tissues by 2.65- and 1.17-fold, respectively，with drought treatment (Table S2).This miRNA targeted the development and drought-related NAC-domain, HD-ZIP Il and auxin response proteins according to the target prediction results (Table S3). Sly-miR398a-5p expressed higher in roots of sensitive genotype in control (1.29-fold) and drought (4.09-fold) conditions，but generally miR398 family expression Was decreased in upground tissues excluding sly-miR398a-3p in sensitive genotype.This up-regulation (2.03-fold) may be responsible for the sensitivity of L. esculentum decreasing CSD activity. The other copper proteins plantacyanin (basic blue) and laccase were the predicted targets of miR408 family (Abdel-Ghany and Pilon,2oo8),and the expression of this family usually decreased by dehydration in plant species such as rice (Zhou et al.,2010), M.truncatula (Trindade etal.,201O),Populus (Ren etal.,2012), peach (Eldem et al.,2012) and cotton (Xie et al.,2015).miR408 is necessary for the adjustment of copper levels in cells as the copper deficiency causes production of ROS and oxidative stress (Abdel-Ghany and Pilon,20o8).The overexpression of miR408 in chickpea led to the inhibition of plantacyanin expression and accumulation of copper and also induction of DREB expression by drought (Hajyzadeh et al.，2015)and overexpression of DREB transcription factors increased drought tolerance in rice (Chen et al.,2008) and Arabidopsis (Xu et al.,2009).According to our results，miR408a-3p targeted laccase protein as well as other drought-related genes GTs and LEA proteins (Table S3).The expression of miR4o8 was decreased after drought treatment. Especially，miR408-3p was down-regulated by -10.09-fold in root tissues of sensitive genotype and this miRNA was suggested as root specific to sensitive genotype as it was expressed only in root tissues of L.esculentum．Besides，miR408a-3p expression was decreased by $- 1 . 0 2$ -fold in upground tissues of tolerant genotypesandwassuggestedasupgroundspecificin L．esculentum var. cerasiforme. High-level ofdecreasein miR408-3p expression in L.esculentum may be the reason of drought sensitivity by comparison with miR408a-3p expression change in tolerant genotype. ",

Overexpression of SAUR39 gene caused the formation of shorter plants with less leaves in rice indicating negative correlation with auxin biosynthesis (Kant et al.,20o9).In contrast, overexpression of SAUR19- 24genes led to large leaves and hypocotyls implyingcell enlargement and plant growth function of SAUR proteins induced by auxin (Spartz et al.，2012). Biotic and abiotic stress induced the differential expression of SAUR genes.For instance, 11 randomly selected SAUR genes were expressed in different tomato tissues and mostly down-regulated by drought treatment (Wu et al.,2012). However,in our results,SAUR expression was found to be down-regulated in root tissues,while up-regulated in upground tissues contrary to miRNA expression profiles indicating tissue-specificfunctionofdroughtsignallingintomato. Sly-miR9552b-3p was expressed only in root tissues of sensitive genotype under control conditions and suppressed in response to stress treatment,so this miRNA might be suggested as root specific in L.esculentum.One of the predicted targets of this miRNA was UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) (Table S3).Glycosyltransferase enzymes of plants (GTs,EC 2.4) function in secondary metabolism and hormone modification catalysing sugar addition to acceptor molecules such as auxin,ABA and flavonoids (Bowles et al.,2005;Tognetti et al.,201O)and play a role in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance (Vogt and Jones，20oo).One of the common glycosyltransferase UGT71C5 was investigated for the elucidation of ABA impact on drought adaptation in Arabidopsis plants，and when the gene was down-regulated，drought tolerance increased but decreased after overexpressionof UGT71C5 (Liu et al.，2015)． These results suggest that the suppression of sly-miR9552b-3p expression with drought may increase UGT level in roots and decrease drought tolerance in sensitive genotype.

One of the important phytohormones,ABA,functions centrally in drought and salinity tolerance regulating main transcriptional processes (Cutler et al.，2010). The carotenoid biosynthesis of plant signal transduction pathway isregulated by ABA signals and these signals finally stimulate ABA-responsive genes regulating the activation/inactivation of type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs)，SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK2s) and ABA-responsive promoter elements binding factors (ABFs) (Golldack et al.,2014; Ma et al.,2009; Vlad et al., 2009).Our results found that PP2C was targeted by 5 miRNAs such as sly-miR393a and sly-miR7696a-3p (Figures 10 and 11b). miR393 was up-regulated in rice (Zhou et al.,201O),Arabidopsis (Liu et al.,20o8) and wheat (Kantar et al.,2011),while downregulated in cotton (Xie et al.，2015) and peach (Eldem et al., 2012).Overexpression of miR393 led to decrease in drought tolerance affecting growth in rice (Xia et al.,2012). However,in this study sly-miR393 was down-regulated in root tissues of sensitive genotype,whereas up-regulated in upground tissues of drought-responsive tomato (Table S2).miR7696 also targeted ABAsignalling pathway，whose expression was significantly altered in upground tissues of sensitive and tolerant genotypes and down-regulated sharply by -12.33-fold in sensitive genotype,whereas up-regulated by 12.25-fold in tolerant genotype after drought exposure.However， this miRNA was expressed higherinroot tissuesundercontrol conditions(Figure 3, Table S2). These results indicate differential regulation of PP2C by several miRNAs in root and upground tissues of droughtsensitive and tolerant genotypes.Similarly，ABF was targeted by sly-miR172a/miR172e-3p and sly-miR5641 (Figures 10 and 11b). When the tomato plants were exposed to drought stress,miR172 family expressed significantly only in upground tissues of sensitive genotype and sly-miR172a and sly-miR172e-3p were downregulated in response to drought by $- 2 . 0 1 -$ and $- 1 . 0 7$ -fold, respectively (Figure 3，Table S2).Sly-miR172 expressionwas decreased after drought treatment in rice (Zhou et al.，2010), barley (Hackenberg et al.，2015)and cotton (Xie et al.，2015), whereas up-regulated in Arabidopsis (Jones-Rhoades and Bartel, 2004),wheat (Kantar etal.,2011) and Populus (Ren et al.,2012). Sly-miR5641 was also down-regulated by $- 4 . 3 1$ -fold in root tissues of tolerant genotype (Figure 3,Table S2).The results show that miR172 is different in response to drought among plant species and ABF gene is regulated by different miRNAs in different tissues and genotypes under drought stress.

High-quality clean small RNA tagsweremappedtotomatogenome(ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/ITAG2.4_release/ ITAG2.4_genomic.fasta) by SOAP (short oligonucleotide alignment program) to find out their expression and distribution on the genome (Li et al.，2oo8a).Then， the matched tags were aligned to NCBl GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) (Benson etal.，2015)and Rfam 11.0 (http://rfam.xfam.org/) (Burge et al.,2013) databases using BLASTall and BLASTn to determine rRNA，tRNA,snRNA and snoRNAs.Following this search,repeat-containing RNAs,sense and antisense exon and intron sequences were detected,and fully matched all RNA types excluding miRNAs were gotten rid of.Then,for annotation of remaining sequences， conserved miRNAs were mapped to miRBase Release (v21 on June 26th，2014) database (http:// Www.mirbase.org/ftp.shtml）(KozomaraandGriffiths-Jones, 2014)and researched for L.esculentum miRNAs.The expression of miRNAs was calculated simultaneously by summing the count of tags overlapping at least 16 nt and/or two mismatches with aligned known miRNAs in database. DEGseq package was used for differential expression analysis of miRNAs,after normalizing rawread numbers with trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization method (Robinson and Oshlack,2010;Wang et al., 2010).For normalization,firstly the normalization factors were calculated and then normalized read numbers were determined using following formula: [raw read counts/(library size $\\times$ normalization factor) $\\times ~ 1 0 ^ { 6 } ]$ (Bai et al.，2014). Fold changes were calculated with the formula $[ \\log _ { 2 }$ (normalized read numbers of group2/group1)]. Then，for the identification of significantly expressed miRNAs,the criteria were used as if (fold change $\\geq 1$ or $\\leq - 1$ ）and $\\cdot P$ or $q$ -value $< 0 . 0 5$ ）(Storey，2003).To show differential expression profile among drought-sensitiveand drought-tolerant tomato root and upgrounds， heatmap was constructed for the most abundant 130 conserved using Qlucore Omics Explorer 3.0 (Qlucore AB)(http://www.qlucore.com/).
