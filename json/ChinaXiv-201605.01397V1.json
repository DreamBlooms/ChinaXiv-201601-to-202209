This low efficiency is partly because of the development of drug resistance of cancer cells. The resistance mechanism is complex and remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that many factors affect the tolerance and sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs [4,5]. Among these factors, the tumor-suppressor gene $\\phi 5 3$ plays an important role in regulating the sensitivity of cancer cells to drugs by blocking cell cycle progression and inducing programmed cell death [2,6]. As a transcription factor,the central domain of $_ { \\mathit { p 5 3 } }$ targets specific DNA sequences and regulates the transcription of downstream target genes. Conversely，the central domain is regulated by many factors,including the C-terminus,which plays a negative role.Previous results have shown that lung cancer cells transfected with a deleted-C-terminal $\\phi 5 3$ grow more slowly than those transfected with full-length $\\phi 5 3$ in vitro [7]. Similar findingshave also been reported [8]. However, the studies of the effect of $\\phi 5 3$ deleting ",

The proliferation of 801D-p53(del) cells was slower than that of 801D-p53(wt) cells.In addition, apoptosis was analyzed by calculating the apoptosis ratios by HCS. Compared with 801D cells,more apoptosis cells appeared in $8 0 1 \\mathrm { D } { \\cdot } \\phi 5 3 \\mathrm { ( w }$ D and $8 0 1 \\mathrm { D } { - } { \\phi } 5 3 ( \\mathrm { d e l } )$ cells (Fig. 2c).

        "text": "$\\rho 5 3$ gene expression has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs in vitro, in vivo,and in clinical trials [18-22]. Because the C-terminal of $\\phi 5 3$ plays a negative regulatory role,we examined the sensitivity of human lung cancer cells with $\\phi 5 3$ deleting the C-terminal to chemotherapeutic drugs with two methods. The experimental results showed that tumor-inhibition rates increased in mice treated with cisplatin in the deleted-C-terminal and full-length $\\phi 5 3$ groups.However, significant tumor inhibition was only achieved intumorsexpressing $\\phi 5 3$ deleting the C-terminal and only in mice treated using the second method after cisplatin treatment. The inhibition rate in cells with $\\phi 5 3$ deleting the C-terminal, but not in those with full-length $\\phi 5 3$ ，was significantly increased compared with the Ad control group with or without paclitaxel treatment in the second,but not in the first method. These results provide direct evidence that $\\phi 5 3$ deletion in the C-terminal increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.In this study, $\\phi 5 3$ deletion of the C-terminal removed 37 amino acids (356-393) of the C-terminal and its noncoding region. These sequences regulate $_ { \\mathit { p 5 3 } }$ function negatively and include sequences that can inhibit $\\phi 5 3$ transcription or induce its degradation when combined with microRNA.This is the first study to report a relationship between $_ { \\mathit { p 5 3 } }$ deleting the C-terminal and chemotherapeutic drug responses.

        "text": "The C-terminal of $\\phi 5 3$ mainly includes the functional domains.TheC-terminal includes thenuclearlocalization signal (NLS), the nuclear export signal, the tetrameriza tion domain,and the C-terminal regulatory domain. The tetramerization domain is essential for DNA binding, protein-protein interactions,post-translational modifications,and $_ { \\mathit { p 5 3 } }$ degradation.Nuclear $_ { \\mathit { p 5 3 } }$ enables its activity as a transcription factor [23-25] and so NLS is essential.In the truncated $\\phi 5 3$ ，we reserve the NLS and the tetramerization domain and remove the other part of the C-terminal. We proved that the truncated $\\phi 5 3$ negatively regulated tumor cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs. However, the mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation: first, it should be clarified as to what elements on these sequences are responsible for the negative regulation. Is it possible that some miRNA or lncmRNA targets these sequences to inhibit $\\phi 5 3$ function or the $3 ^ { \\prime }$ noncoding mRNA sequence is self-regulated? Second, the key genes involved in the signaling pathways through which those repressor sequences regulated drug sensitivity should be identified. It is very important to understand the role of $3 ^ { \\prime }$ sequences of $_ { \\mathit { p 5 3 } }$ in tumor suppression and to elucidate the mechanisms underlined, which would benefit both basic science research and new anticancer drug development.

        "text": "As for the stability and reliability of the two experimental methods,the second method produced smaller SEs than the first method. The SE reflects the size of sampling error, that is,a smaller SE indicates greater stability and reliability of the mean. Thus, the result of the analysis of the SE suggests that the second method is preferable to the first method.Because the size of SE is related to the mean，we also analyzed the ratios of SE and mean. However,the ratio of SE to mean in the Ad-p53- $\\mathrm { ( d e l ) + P D D }$ group was greater for the second method than for the first method in the cisplatin-sensitivity experiments.The result is inconsistent with that of the analysis of SE alone. This discrepancy may be because the SE and mean in the Ad- $\\phi 5 3 ( \\mathrm { d e l } ) + \\mathrm { P D D }$ group were smaller for the second method compared with the first method,given that it is difficult to decrease the SE beyond a certain value in small samples,in brief,whether SEs or the ratios of SEs and mean indicated that the second method was preferable to the first method. Similarly, the ratios of SE and mean in the $\\mathrm { A d } + \\mathrm { T a x } .$ Ad$\\phi 5 3 ( \\mathrm { w t } ) + \\mathrm { T a x }$ ,and $\\mathrm { A d } { - } \\phi 5 3 ( \\mathrm { d e l } ) { + } \\mathrm { T a x }$ groups were lower for the second method compared with the first method in the paclitaxel-sensitivity experiments,which also suggests superiority of the second method.
