In this study,detailed morphological examinations of caryopses were made during the entire 3o-day developmental process.We observed some rapid changes in cell differentiation eventsand cataloged how cellular degeneration processes occurred in maternal tissues.The differentiations of tube cells and cross cells were achieved by 9 days after pollination (DAP).In the testa，the outer integument was degenerated by3 DAP,while the outer layer of the inner integument degenerated by7 DAP.In the nucellus, all tissues with the exception of the nucellar projection and the nucellar epidermis degenerated in the first 5 DAP.By 21 DAP,all maternal tissues，including vascular bundles, the nucellar projection and the nucellar epidermal cells were degenerated.

The rice grain has a complex structure derived from a floret with a caryopsis that is encased by the lemma and palea(Zee 1972;Gu etal.2002; Yoshida and Nagato 201). The caryopsis consists of three genetically distinct components:(i) the diploid maternal tissues including the pericarp,testa and nucellus;(ii) the triploid flial endosperm tissue;and (ii) the diploid filial embryo tissue.All these tissues ina mature caryopsis,with the exception of the embryo and the aleurone,are dead (Krishnan and Dayanandan 2003; Saulnier et al.2o12).Although caryopsis development in different cereal species share some common characteristics, distinct features have been reported in transfercells (Zee 1972), the aleurone layer (Bosnes et al. 1992） and the storage production accumulations (Opanowicz et al. 2011).

        "text": "Krishnan and Dayanandan 2oo3).The pericarp in rice has three vascular bundles,a major one located at the dorsal side and two minor ones at the lateral sides (Krishnan and Dayanandan 2003).The dorsal vascular bundle plays a major role in delivering water,minerals and photosynthesis assimilates to the developing caryopsis (Oparka and Gates 1981; Krishnan and Dayanandan 2oo3). The cell wall invertase CIN2/GIF1 expressed in the dorsal vascularbundle may function to hydrolyze sucrose delivered by the phloem to fructose and glucose，since mutation of this gene led to defected grain filling (Wang et al.2oo8a; Wang et al. 2oo8b). The integument in the ovary consists of a two-layer outer integument and a two-layer inner integument (Krishnan and Dayanandan 2oo3). The outer integument degenerates within 2 days after pollination (DAP),while the degeneration of inner integument is variable depending on the rice cultivars (Krishnan and Dayanandan 2003).It is known that the degeneration of the nucellar projection,which is located adjacent to the dorsal vascular bundle,is critically important for grain filling(Yin and Xue,2012; Yang et al. 2o12). Cells in nucellar epidermis,characterized by ribs of wall-thickening,may function to transport assimilates to the endosperm and embryo (Ellis and Chaffey 1987; Krishnan and Dayanandan 2oo3).We have showed recently that NF-YB1 transcription factor gene expressed in the dorsal aleurone of rice playsa critical role in regulating the expressions of three sucrose transports,allowing sucrose to be loaded directly to the developing starchy endosperm (Bai et al. 2o15). In mature rice caryopsis,the testa derived from integuments and nucellar tissues is fused tightly to the pericarp (Evers and Millar2002; Krishnan and Dayanandan 2oo3).It has been proposed that coordinated physiological interactionsamong different tissues of rice caryopses are crucial for grain filling(Lopesand Larkins 1993)，although the fine details of the morphological and molecular mechanism underlying this complicated process remain largely unknown.

Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor OsMADS29 negatively regulates the degenerations of the nucellus and nucellar projection，as suppressed OsMADS29 expression results in delayed degradation of these two tissues and defective grain filling(Yin and Xue 2012;Yang et al.2o12).

Although the ultimate physiological role of these rapid degenerations of maternal tissues is not yet known,it is plausible that the timely degeneration of these tissues may facilitate effective nutrient loading and may enable the starch accumulated in maternal tissues to be re-utilized for embryo and endosperm development.Further studies are needed to elucidate how these cell layer-specific degenerations are regulated,and which ones,if any,of these degenerations are necessary for grain filling.

        "text": "It is widely assumed that caryopsis development relies heavily oncoordinated interaction between maternal and filial tissues.Maternal tissues likely play at least two major roles in grain filling: (i) to accommodate the developing embryo and endosperm; and (ii) to deliver water and nutrients to the developing embryo and endosperm. Dynamic changes observed in this study in maternal tissues during caryopsis development seem to correlate with the fulfillment of these two major roles.After fertilization (o-9 DAP)，the rice caryopsis undergoes the rapid expansion in three dimensions. The changes of cell shape and the thickening of cell wall in the maternal tissues coordinate with the expansions of caryopsis foraccommodating the developing filial tissues.Detailed microarray profiling using the 25 stages/organs of rice reproductive development showed that many putative pectin methylesterases and putative cellulose synthase genes related to cell wall component metabolism expressed in embryogenesis stages，suggesting cell wall metabolism，is probably essential for developing seeds (Fujita et al.2010). From 5 to 9 DAP,two tightly interlaced cross cell layers and one loosely packed tube celllayer are formed in the endocarp; this may provide rigid support to the developing caryopsis. It is believed that the dorsal vascular bundle plays a crucial role in loading water and photosynthesis assimilates to the developing endosperm (Oparka and Gates 1981，1982; Krishnan and Dayanandan 20o3; Radchuk et al. 2011; Yang et al.2o12).In this study,we observed rapid establishment of TEsand SEs in the dorsal vascular bundle in the first 6 DAP. Formation of these TEs and SEs correlated tightly with the rapid accumulation of starch grains in the starchy endosperm, which occurs between 5 and 18 DAP.By 8 DAP,thickened cell wallswere formed between the inner integument and the nucellar epidermis in all regions surrounding the embryo sac, with the exception of the nucellar projection.These fortified cell wallsat the outer surface of the nucellar epidermisare rich in lipids,a situation that resembles the cuticle layer in the epidermisand may help to establishawaterproof barrier that isolates the developing endosperm (Oparka and Gates 1981; ",

In contrast, the lack ofa nucellar epidermis in the region near the dorsal vascular bundle may help to establish an open channel for loading water and nutrients to the developing endosperm and embryo (Krishnan and Dayanandan 2oo3).In barley and wheat,it has been shown that the dorsal vascular bundle is the major route for water and nutrient deliveries to the developing caryopsis (Felker and Shannon 198o; Wang and Fisher 1994a,1994b; Zhang et al. 2007). In rice it has been shown that the cell wall invertase GlF1 is expressed in the dorsal vascular bundle (Wang et al. 2oo8a),and MonosaccharideTransporter4(MST4) are expressed in both thematernal tissues,including the vascular bundle and filial tissues (Wang et al.2oo7),suggesting the presence of one route delivery of fructose and glucose to starchy endosperm after the sucrose isreleased from the dorsal vascular bundle.We showed recently that a NF-YB1 transcription factor expressed in aleurone regulates the expressions of three sucrose transporters in the aleurone,allowing sucrose to be loaded directly to the starchy endosperm of rice (Bai et al. 2015), suggesting the presence of another independent route for loading sugars to the rice endosperm.Physiological studies using radioactive labeled sugars performed in the past have already showed that sucrose is the major form for sugar loaded to the barley endosperm (Melkus et al.2o11).As illustrated in Figure 10, the formation of a nucellar epidermis-dorsal vascular bundlenucellar projection complex may establish a cellular channel to allow efficient waterand sugar to be delivered from the dorsal vascular bundle to the developing caryopsis in a regulated manner.
