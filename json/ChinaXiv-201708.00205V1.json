        "text": "Abstract Sabertooth cats were extinct carnivorans that have atracted great attention and controversy because of their unique dental morphology representing an entirely extinct mode of feeding specialization. Some of them are lion-sized or tiger-sized carnivorans who are widely interpreted as hunters of larger and more powerful preys than those of their modern nonsabertoothed relatives.We report the discovery of a large sabertooth cat skull of Machairodus horribilis from the Late Miocene of northwestern China.It shares some characteristics with derived sabertooth cats,but also is similar to extant pantherines in some cranial characters.A functional morphological analysis suggests that it differed from most other machairodont felids and had a limited gape to hunt smaller preys. Its anatomical features provide new evidence for the diversity of killing bites even within in the largest saber-toothed carnivorans and offer an additional mechanism for the mosaic evolution leading to functional and morphological diversity in sabertooth cats.

        "text": "Sabertooth cats (Machairodontinae） were widely distributed in the Neogene and Quaternary faunas of the Old and New Worlds (Werdelin,1996; McHenry et al.,2007). They were a long-living extinct clade among carnivorans,appearing from the Middle Miocene, and became extinct after a brief period of coexistence with early human beings in the Early Holocene (for example,at Rancho La Brea in Los Angeles, California, USA) (Turner and Anton,1997).Some scenarios for the demise of the largest sabertooth cats include one where early human beings had gradually developed stronger hunting ability to outcompete the sabertooth cats,and/or sabertooth cats themselves becoming the prey of human beings (Martin, 1989).Like living big cats (Pantherinae), the large size of sabertooth cats is an advantage in predatory activity (Turner and Antón,1997; Antón and Galobart, 1999; Andersson et al., 2011; Salesa et al., 2Oo5),and some of them had a lion-like or tiger-like size (adult body mass even more than $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ for Smilodon populator) (Christiansen and Harris,2oo5；de Castro and Langer, 20o8). On the other hand, the early materials of sabertooth cats were mostly fragmentary, therefore body size disparity and evolution throughout the machairodont felids are not well characterized. Only recently, several complete skulls of machaiodonts were described from Europe and China (Antón et al., 2004; Geraads et al.,2004; Qiu et al., 2008),among which Machairodus horribilis was considered to be the largest one (Qiu et al.,2008). The sizes of these machairodonts are judged according to their skulls with basilar lengths from $2 8 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ to $2 9 9 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ ,and within this large-size class there are additional distinct morphological differences. Among them, some forms are similar to the highly specialized Smilodon and Homotherium,whereas others are more similar to extant pantherines.These important materials of sabertooth cats document mosaic evolution and the resulting significant morphological and ecological diversity in the evolutionary radiation of these carnivorans (Antón,2013).

        "text": "Here we report on a large sabertooth cat skull found to date from the Late Miocene Hipparion Red Clay at Longjiagou in Wudu County, Gansu Province, China, with the geographical coordinates of $3 3 ^ { \\circ } 3 5 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { N }$ $1 0 4 ^ { \\circ } 5 0 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { E }$ (Zhang and Xue, 1995). The Longjiagou Basin is located on a planation surface of $2 4 0 0 { - } 2 6 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m }$ ,which formed in the Late Miocene,and it is a small intramontane basin with an area of about $1 5 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ，with lengths of about $6 . 5 \\mathrm { k m }$ in north and south and $1 { - } 2 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { k m }$ in east and west. The fossiliferous bed is dark red silty mudstone, with blue-gray sandstones, lower part of which is mudstones with conglomerates, $2 0 { - } 3 4 0 \\ \\mathrm { m }$ in total thickness.A comprehensive study about the Longjiagou Hipparion fauna is currently being carried out.From the present classification of the specimens,it shows that most elements of this fauna are typical fosil mammals of Baodean. Therefore biostratigraphically the fauna is almost certainly of Baodean age.However, the fauna includes younger faunal elements, for example,Gazella cf. G.blacki,which are found mainly in the Early Pliocene.Hipparion platyodus from Wudu is more derived than other Turolian Hipparion in other regions of China. As a result, the age of the Longjiagou fauna is tentatively assigned to late Baodean (Zhang and Xue,1995; Qiu et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2013). ",

Scorings for M. horribilis from Longjiagou were based on the skull (NWU $4 8 \\mathrm { w d 0 0 0 1 }$ and for M. horribilis from Baode were based on skulland mandible (IVPP V 15642).

However, Canis lupus and Cryptoprocta ferox were retained as caniform and feliform outgroups,respectively. The data matrix was analysed using the TNT software package (Goloboff et al.,2008) and PAUP\\*(Swofford,1991).Analyses in TNT were run using both implicit enumeration and traditional search, with default settings apart from the following: 99999 maximum trees in memory and 1000 replications. The analysis resulted in 19 equally parsimonious trees, each having a length of 116 steps,a CI of 0.621,and a RI of 0.805.

Both TNT and PAUP\\* produced cladograms of identical topologies. We next estimated support for the clades present in the strict consensus tree by running bootstrap and jackknife resampling analyses in both programs with 10oo replications. In addition, we calculated decay index (or Bremer support) in both programs. We also calculated support values using the symmetric resampling function in TNT.Lastly, we analyzed the dataset under a Bayesian framework using MrBayes version 3.2 (Ronquist et al., 2O12). The morphology matrix was treated as a single partition assigned with the Mk model for morphology.

Among living meat eaters, almost all species larger than about $2 1 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ prey on species as large or larger than themselves because of energetic demands (Carbone et al., 1999). Because sabertooth cats were generally strongly built animals, it has been suggested that they specialized in taking larger prey than extant pantherines (Akersten, 1985; Turner and Antón,1997). Differences among carnivoran species in killing and feeding behavior are often reflected in their craniodental morphology (Biknevicius et al.,1996). It was even once proposed that saberlike teeth evolved convergently in saber-toothed mammals and allosaurid dinosaurs as an adaptation for predation on prey species ten or more times heavier than the predators (Bakker, 1998).Larger predators specialize on larger prey (Radloff and du Toit,20o4).

If a throat bite was the main killing technique of sabertooth cats, then killing of a larger prey required a larger gape. For example,Smilodon has an enormous gape of $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (Antón et al.,2004; Andersson et al., 2011). On the other hand, $M .$ horribilis has the strong pre- and postglenoid processes to make its glenoid fossa very deep, which is similar to the pantherine, such as the lion and leopard, so it has only a moderate gape of about $7 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (Antón et al., 1998; Andersson et al.,2011).Moreover, the inclined occiput of $M .$ horribilis indicates that the fibers of the temporal muscle are strongly inclined as in primitive cats,while in derived machairodontines these fibers become more vertically oriented (Antón et al., 2004). The larger degree of inclination in M. horribilis represents a limitation for dorsal extension of the head over the atlas,therefore in turn limits the head action required in the canine-shear bite (Antón et al.,2004; McHenry et al., 2007; but see recent discussion of Smilodon mechanism by Brown, 2O14).Although the strongly developed mastoid crest of $M .$ horribilis provides a larger area for insertion of the atlanto-mastoid muscles and indicates that the strength of these muscles would be greater than in pantherines, contributing to the potential for head depression, it is less efficient than in more derived machairodontines (Anton et al.,2004).

The key advantage of the initial development of saber-like teeth would lie in the eficiency of a killing bite that caused massive blood loss instead of suffocation,rather than in the possibility of taking significantly larger prey (Turner and Anton, 1997). It is reasonable, however, that more derived sabertooth cats with a larger gape and more specialized musculoskeletal complex than M. horribilis would have been able to take prey larger relative to their body size.

The unique combination of a restricted gape and very large size in M. horribilis could represent an adaptation to a particular prey size class,given the multitude of paleoenvironments it has been found in. M. horribilis lived both in woodlands of Longjiagou and also in completely open grasslands (for example in Baode). As such M. horribilis likely was sympatric with forest mammals such as primates (Xue and Delson,1989), chalicotheres (Xue and Coombs,1985),and the deer Eostyloceros (Zhang and Xue,1995) as well as more typical open grassland forms. The dwarf horses of the Longjiagou fauna are morphologically different from the tall Hipparion horses in Baode and other regions, in having a less cursorial postcranial skeleton that may have provided stable food supply for the population containing the largest known Machairodus. Different from the rich giraffids in other localities,the giraffds were rare for individuals and low in taxonomic diversity at Longjiagou. The predatory behavior of large carnivorans may be interpreted according to the mass-energetics “law”(Carbone et al., 1999), but the encounter rate for prey is also an important factor. Moreover, the height of giraffe increased its predator detection capability and threat of injury to predators from its hooves,thus it is not very suitable as a regular prey of sabertooth cats (Hayward and Kerley,2Oo5). Gigantic Late Miocene sabertooth cats elsewhere,by contrast, lived in an open steppe that was conducive for them to pursue preys at a burst of high speed and attack preys with a very large gape. ",

The mixture of primitive and derived morphological characteristics in the cranium of $M .$ horribilis is consistent with previously observed mosaic evolutionary patterns in early machairodontines, and additionally provides evidence that gigantism may be one of several mechanisms to increase gape prior to the evolution of the full suite of anatomical features associated with more efficient killing bite mechanism (Anton, 2013).Future discoveries of postcranial elements belonging to M. horribilis would alow these functional morphological interpretations to be further tested.

        "text": "摘要：剑齿虎是一类绝灭的食肉目动物，由于其独特的牙齿形态代表了已完全消失的特化取食方式而引起了极大的关注和争论。一些剑齿虎是狮子体型或老虎体型的食肉动物，它们被广泛认为能够比其不具剑形犬齿的现代近亲捕杀更大和更强壮的猎物。本文报道在甘肃省晚中新世地层中发现的一具属于恐剑齿虎(Machairodus horribilis)的大型头骨。这件标本的一些特征与进步的剑齿虎相同，但在某些头骨性状上则与现生的豹亚科种类相似。不同于其他大多数剑齿虎，功能形态分析指示该剑齿虎的口部张开程度受到限制，因此只能捕猎相对较小的猎物。这具头骨的解剖特征为证明即使在最大的具剑形犬齿的食肉目动物中也存在捕猎咬杀方式的多样性提供了新的证据，并揭示了在剑齿虎中导致功能和形态多样性镶嵌进化的另一种机制。",
