        "text": "AbstractIn 1958,a special type of dinosaur egg was discovered in Zhaotuan, Laiyang, Shandong Province, China.Although only a large eggshell fragment was collected, its extremely large thickness indicated that the eggshell fragment represented a new ootaxon.In previous studies,it was named Spheroolithus megadermusand assigned to the oogenus Spheroolithus under the oofamily of the Spheroolithidae based on the microstructure in radial view. However, a comparative study of the microstructure in tangential views between the large eggshellfragment from Laiyang and the recently reported Multifissoolithus from Zhejiang Province,China and Yamaguchi, Japan revealed that all of them have roughly paralleled and wavy clefts. Therefore, this study reassigned the large eggshell fragment from Laiyang to Multifissoolithus of the Dongyangoolithidae and discussed its unique compact layer near the eggshell's iner surface,as well as the chronological and spatial distribution of dongyangoolithid eggs.The reassignment of the holotype of Spheroolithus megadermus also indicates that the referred specimen of Spheroolithus megadermus from Changtu, Liaoning Province becomes the holotype of a new oospecies Spheroolithus quantouensis.

In a review of the spherical dinosaur eggs from Laiyang, Shandong Province, Zhao and Jiang（1974) compared $O$ 、megadermus with other specimens and confirmed that it represented an independent oospecies. Zhao （1979) erected the Spheroolithidae based on the spherical dinosaur eggs from Laiyang. The large eggshell fragment was assigned to the type oogenus Spheroolithus of the Spheroolithidae. However, this assignment was uncertain due to the lack of comparative material (Zhao, 1979; Zhao et al.,2015). In a reassessment of the spherical dinosaur eggs housed at the Dalian Natural History Museum (DLNHM) from Changtu, Liaoning Province,Liu et al. (2013) described a half spherical egg with an eggshell thickness of $4 . 8 \\mathrm { - } 5 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and considered it as a referred specimen of Spheroolithus megadermus. ",

This ootaxon shared several characteristics with Spheroolithus such as a relatively thick eggshell and isolated eggshell units with triangular cunei near the inner surface of eggshell, but the clefts throughout the whole eggshell were not seen in Spheroolithus (Zhang et al.,2019). In this study, the eggshell microstructure in the tangential section of the large eggshell fragment from Laiyang,Shandong Province was studied for the first time,revealing the microstructural similarity between the large eggshell fragment from Laiyang and the Multifissoolithus fragment from Yiwu. Thus, the large eggshell fragment from Laiyang was reassigned to Multifissoolithus,and a new oospecies of Spheroolithus was erected based on the specimen from Changtu,Liaoning Province which indeed belongs to Spheroolithus.The revision of the large eggshellfragment from Laiyang also extended the chronological and spatial distribution of dongyangoolithid eggs.

Due to the absence of dongyangoolithid eggs in the overlaying Jingangkou Formation in Laiyang and other younger Upper Cretaceous deposits in China (Hu et al.,2001; Wang et al.,2012; Zhao et al.,2013), the M. megadermus could represent the latest member for Dongyangoolithidae.

        "text": "摘要：1958年在山东莱阳赵疃村发现了一种特殊类型的恐龙蛋化石。尽管只发现了一枚较大的蛋壳碎片，但其极大的厚度表明它是一个新的蛋种。研究者根据蛋壳径切面的显微结构将它归人圆形蛋科的圆形蛋属并命名为厚皮圆形蛋。然而，与新近报道的产自中国浙江省和日本山口县的多裂隙蛋属的弦切面结构进行对比发现，它们都具有大致平行并且呈波浪状的裂隙。因此将产自莱阳的这块蛋壳碎片重新归入东阳蛋科的多裂隙蛋属，并讨论了东阳蛋类近蛋壳内表面的致密层以及东阳蛋类的时空分布情况。同时，产自辽宁昌图的厚皮圆形蛋的归入标本成为新修订的泉头圆形蛋的正型标本。",
