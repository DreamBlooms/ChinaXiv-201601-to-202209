        "text": "Abstract: Yardangs are typical aeolian erosion landforms, which are atracting more and more attention of geomorphologists and geologists for their various morphology and enigmatic formation mechanisms.In order to clarify the aeolian environments that influence the development of long-ridge yardangs in the northwestern Qaidam Basin of China,the present research investigated the winds by installing wind observation tower in the field. We found that the sand-driving winds mainly blow from the north-northwest, northwest and north,and occur the most frequent in summer, because the high temperature increases atmospheric instability and leads to downward momentum transfer and active local convection during these months.The annual drift potential and the ratio of resultant drift potential indicate that the study area pertains to a high-energy wind environment and a narrow unimodal wind regime. The wind energy decreases from northwest to southeast in the Qaidam Basin,with the northerly winds in the northwestern basin changing to more westerly in the southeastern basin. The strong and unidirectional wind regime for the long-ridge yardangs in the northwestern Qaidam Basin results from the combined effects of topographic obstacles such as the Altun Mountains and of the interaction between the air stream and the yardang bodies. Present study suggests that yardang evolution needs such strong and unidirectional winds in high- or intermediate-energy wind environments.This differs from sandy deserts or sandy lands,which usually develop at low- or intermediate-energy wind environments. Present study clarifies the wind regime corresponding to the long-ridge yardangs' development, and lays firm foundation to put forward the formation mechanisms for yardangs in the Qaidam Basin. ",

It is a typical aeolian erosion landform that is widespread in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Qaidam Basin and Taklimakan Desert in China (Xia,1987; Li et al., 2016a),the Gobi Desert in Mongolia (Ritley and Erdennebat, 2O04), the Lut Desert in Iran (Alavipanah et al., 2007; Ehsani and Quiel, 2008), the Um Al-Rimam depresson in northern Kuwait (Al-Dousari et al.,2009), the Western Desert in Egypt (Breed et al.,1979; Grolier et al., 1980),the Bodelé Depression in Chad (Bristow et al.,2009),the Ebro Depression in northeastern Spain (Gutierrez-Elorza et al.,2002), the Rogers Dry Lake in the USA (Ward and Greeley,1984) and the western coastal desert in South America (Inbar and Risso, 2Oo1; de Silva et al., 2010),as well as the regions on Mars and Venus (Ward,1977; Trego,1990,1992; Greeley et al.，1995; Bridges et al.,2010; Zimbelman and Griffin,2010),and possibly on Titan (Paillou et al., 2016). Comparative researches on terrestrial yardangs and their Martian counterparts have become increasingly popular in recent years (de Silva et al., 2010; Zimbelman and Griffin,2010; Wang et al.,2018). Yardangs bear rich information on their Martian aeolian history and provide important insights into geomorphic development of the Martian surface (Laity, 2Oo9). Though yardangs are found at the margin of most major deserts around the world, they nevertheless cover only a small percentage of Earth's land surface. ",

        "text": "There are still much dispute remains to be determined about the formation mechanisms of yanrdangs (Laity, 2Oo9). Yardangs are sculpted by a combination of aeolian erosion, fluvial erosion, weathering, mass movement and corrosion (Laity, 2009; Dong et al., 2012a). Aeolian erosion includes abrasion and deflation, of which abrasion by saltating sand particles is probably the dominant process in the formation of yardangs (Goudie,2Oo7). Although suspended particles have relatively low kinetic energy, they can reach significant heights above the ground surface and also play an important role in sculpting yardangs (Dong et al., 2O12a). Deflation of loose sediments caused by aeolian abrasion and weathering can expose new rock surfaces to further abrasion and accelerating yardang formation. And deflation may play a particularly important role in poorly indurated lacustrine material (Laity,2009,2011). The role of fluvial erosion in sculpting yardangs has long been noticed by geographers, who attributed the formation of yardangs to initial erosion by running water, followed by wind erosion (Hedin,1903; Xia,1987). Physical weathering caused by dramatic temperature variations in arid and hyper-arid regions creates fractures on the rock surface,which facilitate subsequent action of exogenous forces.Aeolian abrasion and fluvial erosion of underlying soft and loose sediments can lead to collapse of the overlying strata. Yardang sediments are usually bonded tightly by salts and form a hard crust that is resistant to wind erosion. However, rainfall and running water can dissolve the salts and disintegrate the crust.The greater the salt content, the more significant the corrosion (Dong et al., 2012a). In practice,different combinations of these processes may operate together in different environments. ",

Fan (1962) studied the landforms near Lenghu town in the northern Qaidam Basin and identified three types of yardangs: pyramid, long-ridge and streamlined whaleback. Following this work,Halimov and Fezer(1989) further classified yardangs into eight types and proposed a comprehensive evolutionary sequence for yardangs in the Qaidam Basin based on the factors that control their evolution during different stages. Wang et al. (2O11) constructed a model for evaluating the abrasion rate of yardangs in the western Qaidam Basin and found that the rate ranged from 0.011 to $0 . 3 9 8 \\ \\mathrm { m m / a }$ between 1986 and 2010,which was much smaller than the yardangs in the Lop Nor Region (Xia, 1987),but agreed with the bedrock incision rate calculated by the cosmogenic $^ { 1 0 } \\mathrm { { B e } }$ method in the Qaidam Basin (Rohrmann et al., 2013). Li and Dong (2011) and Li et al. (2012，2013，2016a） investigated the sediment characteristics，wind regime, distribution and morphological characteristics of yardangs in the Qaidam Basin.

They found that most yardangs had developed near anticlines and in Pliocene strata. Mao et al.

Wang et al.(2018） comprehensively demonstrated the classification， distribution,morphometry and evolution of yardangs throughout the basin and compared them with yardangs on Mars. Based on the orientation of yardangs and dunes,Wu et al. (2O18) reconstructed the palaeo-wind regime during the Late Holocene in the Qaidam Basin and found that the yardangs and dunes in the eastern basin represented the westerly during the Last Glacial Maximum, while the aeolian landforms in the central and western part represented the northwesterly Asian winter monsoon.

        "text": "The long-ridge yardangs in the northwestern Qaidam Basin formed under a narrow unimodal wind regime, with the effective winds mainly blowing from the NNW (Fig. 7a). Compared with the longridge yardangs, typical whaleback yardangs at the northern margin of Dabsan Lake in the centralsouth Qaidam Basin (Fig.la) evolved under an intermediate-energy wind environment with a wide unimodal wind regime.The barchan dunes downwind of the typical whaleback yardangs developed under an intermediate-energy wind environment with a narrow unimodal wind regime (Fig. 7b; Li et al., 2013). The linear dunes in the same area also formed under an intermediate-energy wind environment, but with a wide unimodal wind regime (Fig. 7c; Bao et al., 2015). Therefore, wind energy in the Qaidam Basin decreases from the northwest to the central-south, with a transition from high to intermediate. Under the influence of the topography surrounding the basin, the N winds in the northwestern basin gradually turn towards W winds in the central-southern basin, leading to a transition from a narrow unimodal wind regime to a wide unimodal wind regime. At the southeastern edge of the Qaidam Basin, where SW (southwest) winds arise,a large area of network dune fields has formed (Fig.7d). Hence, with the wind regime complexity increases from the central-southern to southeastern Qaidam Basin, the corresponding dune forms are transformed from simple barchan and linear dunes to compound network dunes.

In addition, most of these compared regions have bimodal or complex wind regimes.The distinctive difference of wind regimes between the long-ridge yardangs and the compared regions also suggests that yardang formation requires strong and unidirectional winds (Goudie,2007). Strong winds from the Tarim Basin and Kumtagh Desert overflowed the passing aisle in the Altun Mountains and later descend to form an extremely dry foehn when they enter the Qaidam Basin (Halimov and Fezer,1989). This descending wind sculpted the initial pluvial-alluvial plains and playa surfaces of our study area,and gradually sculpted the large longridge yardang fields in the northwestern Qaidam Basin. Subsequently, the interaction between the wind and the long-ridge yardangs created a funneling effect that both concentrated and strengthened the air stream in the inter-yardang corridors. This would have caused RDP/DP to evolve towards the value of 1.00. ",

        "text": "In this study, we analyzed the wind regime (speed and direction) for long-ridge yardangs in the northwestern Qaidam Basin and compared it with the other regions. We found that the sand-driving winds mainly blew from the NNW, NW and N directions,and were the severest in summer and spring. Annual DP and RDP/DP indicate that the study area pertains to an extremely high-energy wind environment and a narrow unimodal wind regime.The strong and unidirectional wind regime that created and subsequently shaped the long-ridge yardangs in the northwestern Qaidam Basin can be atributed to a combination of the topographic obstacle created by the Altun Mountains and interactions between the descending air stream that passes over these mountains and the yardang bodies. Yardangs in the Qaidam Basin have developed under a high- and intermediate-energy wind environment, which differs from the environment in most Chinese sandy deserts or sandy lands, which are generally controlled by low- or intermediate-energy wind environments.
