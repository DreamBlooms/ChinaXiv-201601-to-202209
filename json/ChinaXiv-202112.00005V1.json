        "text": "Abstract: Nitrogen $\\mathrm { ( N ) }$ and phosphorus $( \\mathrm { P } )$ are two essential nutrients that determine plant growth and many nutrient cycling processes. Increasing $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ deposition is an important driver of ecosystem changes. However, in contrast to numerous studies about the impacts of nutrient addition on forests and temperate grasslands, how plant foliar stoichiometry and nutrient resorption respond to $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and $\\mathrm { \\Delta P }$ addition in alpine grasslands is poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted an $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ addition experiment (involving control, N addition, $\\mathrm { \\Delta P }$ addition, and $\\mathrm { \\Delta N + P }$ addition) in an alpine grassland on Kunlun Mountains (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region，China) in 2016 and 2017 to investigate the changes in leaf nutrient concentrations (i.e., leaf N, Leaf ${ \\mathrm { l } } _ { 3 } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ ~ } }$ and leaf N:P ratio) and nutrient resorption efficiency of Seripbidium rbodantbum and Stipa capillata, which are dominant species in this grassland.Results showed that $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition has significant effects on soil inorganic $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ ${ ( \\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } } ^ { - } { - } \\mathrm { N }$ and $\\mathrm { N H _ { 4 } ^ { + } { - } N }$ ）and leaf N of both species in the study periods. Compared with green leaves, leaf nutrient concentrations and nutrient resorption eficiency in senesced leaves of $S _ { \\cdot }$ ，rbodantbum was more sensitive to $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition,whereas $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition influenced leaf N and leaf N:P ratio in green and senesced leaves of $S$ 、capillata.N addition did not influence $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ resorption efficiency of the two species. $\\mathrm { \\Delta P }$ addition and $\\mathrm { { N + P } }$ addition significantly improved leaf $\\mathrm { \\Delta P }$ and had a negative effect on $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ resorption eficiency of the two species in the study period. These influences on plants can be explained by increasing $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ availability. The present results illustrated that the two species are more sensitive to $\\mathrm { \\Delta P }$ addition than $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition,which implies that $\\mathrm { \\Delta P }$ is the major limiting factor in the studied alpine grassland ecosystem.In addition,an interactive effect of $\\mathrm { { N + P } }$ addition was only discernable with respect to soil availability,but did not affect plants. Therefore, exploring how nutrient characteristics and resorption response to $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ addition in the alpine grassand is important to understand nutrient use strategy of plants in terrestrial ecosystems.

Theimbalanced $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ deposition induced by human activities,such as fertilization and fossil fuel combustion (Delonge et al., 2Oo8),affects the primary production of plants and profoundly influences the structure and function of ecosystems (Sardans et al.，2012; Chen et al.,2015; Monuca et al.，2O21). To explore how nutrient cycling between plants and soil in different ecosystems responds to nutrient deposition, researchers conducted many experimental studies (Chen et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016). For example, Tian and Niu (2015) reported that excessive N addition influences nutrient cycling between plants and soil and intensifies soil acidification in a global meta-analysis. Yang (2018） established an experiment of external $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ addition in a subtropical forest and concluded that P addition improves leaf P concentration but has no effect on P resorption eficiency (PRE). These studies help explain the impacts of nutrient addition on plant growth and nutrient cycling processes in ecosystems (Chen et al., 2015; Tian and Niu, 2015). ",

        "text": "Leaf nutrient concentrations are the most vital indicators of plant growth (Yang, 2018; Xu et al., 2021)and are generally positively correlated with soil nutrient availability when the ecosystem is limited by nutrient resources (Garnier, 1998). They are also correlated with internal nutrient resorption, which is a critical nutrient conservation strategy for plants (Killingbeck,1996; Vergutz et al.,2012). Nutrient resorption efciency (NuRE) is used to quantify nutrient resorption in plants (Wright and Westoby, 2003; Chen et al., 2015). Generally, $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ concentration less than $0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / g }$ in senesced leaves denotes a high PRE,and N concentration higher than $7 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / g }$ in senesced leaves signifies a low N resorption efficiency (NRE) (Killingbeck，1996). Furthermore， negative relationships between NuRE and leaf nutrient concentrations have been widely reported (Chen et al.,2012; Lü et al.，2013; Zheng et al., 2020).Lu et al. (2013) demonstrated that NRE of six sub-arctic bog species decreases following four years of experimental $\\mathsf { N }$ addition. However, positive and neutral relationships between NuRE and leaf nutrient concentrations have also been revealed (Aerts,1996; Chen et al., 2015). For example, a meta-analysis conducted by Yuan and Chen et al. (2O15） showed that NuRE does not change with nutrient addition,possibly because nutrient concentrations in plants depend more on external nutrient supply rather than internal resorption in some ecosystems. This finding difers from that of Yang (2O18),who found that approximately $50 \\%$ of green leaf nutrients are resorbed from senesced leaves. These contradictory results suggest that further studies on NuRE response to nutrient addition are needed to understand nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. ",

        "text": "Ecological stoichiometric characteristics are also important indices of plant growth. From freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems，N:P ratio is widely employed to elucidate nutrient limitations (Güsewell, 2004; Elser et al., 2007; Jin et al., 2020).Koerselman and Meuleman (1996) reported that plants in a wetland ecosystem are limited by P when N:P ratio is higher than 16 and limited by $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ when the ratio is lower than 14. Zhang et al. (2Oo4) revealed that an N:P ratio lower than 21 signifies N limitation while a ratio higher than 23 suggests P limitation in a steppe ecosystem in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. These results indicate that N:P ratio is determined by ecosystem types and plant species (Verterink et al., 2O0l; Menge and Field, 2007). However, recent studies about N:P ratio have tended to focus on green leaves while neglecting senesced leaves (Liu et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,2017). Persson et al. (2010) concluded that N:P ratios in green leaves are more stable than those in senesced leaves due to nutrient resorption (Chen et al.，2O15). Therefore，understanding how increasing $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ addition influences N:P ratio in senesced leaves is also important. ",

For example, Tian and Niu (2015) showed that N addition decreases soil $\\mathfrak { p H }$ but increases P desorption. Penuelas et al. (2013） suggested that long-term $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ inputs shift ecosystem limitation from N to P. However, our understanding of nutrient cycling responses to external nutrient inputs in alpine grasslands is limited (Sardans et al.,2012). In addition, N and $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ are believed to be linked tightly in nutrient cycle processes,and the interactive effects of these nutrients appear to difer from the effect of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ or $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ addition alone (Peng et al.,2019).Moreover, the interactive influence of the addition of these major nutrients in alpine grasslands is less well understood. Hence, in order to determine how increasing N and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ deposition influences terrestrial ecosystems, it is necessary to explore the effects of N and $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ addition,as well as the combination of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and P, on leaf nutrient concentrations and nutrient resorption efficiency in alpine grasslands.

Killingbeck (1996) showed that plants have a high $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ use efficiency when $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ concentration in senesced leaves is lower than $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m g / g }$ and a low $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ use efficiency when $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ concentration in senesced leaves is higher than $7 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / g }$ Our data revealed that $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ concentrations in green and senesced leaves of both species are $< 0 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m g / g }$ which suggests that both species have a high $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ use efficiency.Furthermore,our data showed that the two species are more sensitive to $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ addition than $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition and the degree of variations under $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ addition was greater than that under $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition. This finding is similar to previous studies. For instance,Bobbink（l991） reported that in a chalk grassland in Holland,leaf $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ concentrations increase to a greater extent than leaf N concentrations. This patern has also been reported in alpine tundra (Bowman et al.,1993) and other P-limited ecosystems (Sword et al.,2004; Gusewell, 2005; Ostertag，2O10). These results also suggest that nutrient addition would change leaf nutrient concentrations, which consequently facilitates litter decomposition and accelerates nutrient cycling between plants and soil (Zhang et al.,2Oo8). In addition, these results support the finding that the influence of nutrient addition depends on the experimental duration and species (Mayor et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2015) reported some differences between short-term and long-term results in terms of grass responses to nutrient addition. Tian and Niu (2015) suggested that long-term N addition intensifies soil acidification and increases P availability through P desorption (Wang et al., 2011).Therefore，more long-term studies are necessary to investigate how external nutrient addition influences nutrient cycling between plants and soil.

These results also support the hypothesis that $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ is not the major limiting element in the alpine grassland system.Paddition decreases PRE of S. capillata, similar to a previous study showing that PRE has a negative relationship with leaf P (Lüi et al., 2O13). Our data indicated that $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ addition in the two years not only changes P absorption directly but also influences the internal resorption of $S$ capillata.P inputs exert no influence on PRE of S. rhodanthum,which is consistent with the findings of Yuan and Chen (2015),who found that $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ addition increases $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ concentrations but has no effect on PRE of some plants in P-limited ecosystems.The possble reason might be that these plants cannot adjust nutrient characteristics quickly in response to environmental change. The two species (S. capillata and S. rhodanthum) demonstrated different strategic responses to $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ addition. These results confirmed that species is the dominant factor for nutrient dynamics (He et al., 2008).

S. capillata is more sensitive to $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ addition and has a higher $\\mathrm { \\bf ~ P }$ use efficiency than S.rhodanthum. Given that S.rhodanthum is insensitive to $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition, increasing $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition would support the growth of S. capillata. However, although $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition supports the growth of S. capillata, this alpine grassand is P-limited and S. capillata is mainly limited by P.Future studies should explore the responses of the two species to nutrient addition over a longer period.
