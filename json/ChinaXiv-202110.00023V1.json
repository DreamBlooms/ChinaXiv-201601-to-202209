This paper studied the impacts of climate change on the streamflow of Zarrineh River.The streamflow was simulated and projected for the period 1992-2050 through seven CMIP5 (coupled model intercomparison project phase 5) data series (namely, BCC-CSM1-1, BNU-ESM, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0，GFDL-ESM2G, IPSL-CM5A-LR,MIROC-ESM and MIROC-ESM-CHEM) under RCP2.6 (RCP, representative concentration pathways) and RCP8.5. The model data series were statistically downscaled and bias corrected using an artificial neural network (ANN) technique and a Gamma based quantile mapping bias correction method.The best model (CSIRO-Mk3-6-0) was chosen by the TOPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) method from seven CMIP5 models based on statistical indices.For simulation of streamflow,a rainfal-runoff model,the hydrologiska byrans vattenavdelning (HBV-Light) model, was utilized. Results on hydro-climatological changes in Zarrineh River basin showed that the mean daily precipitation is expected to decrease from O.94 and $0 . 9 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ in 2015 to 0.65 and $0 . 6 8 \\mathrm { m m }$ in 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5,respectively. In the case of temperature, the numbers change from $1 2 . 3 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $1 2 . 3 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ in 2015 to $1 4 . 2 8 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $1 4 . 3 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ in 2050. Corresponding to these climate scenarios, this study projected a decrease of the annual streamflow of Zarrineh River by half from 2015 to 2050 as the results of climatic changes willead to a decrease in the annual streamflow of Zarrineh River from $5 9 . 4 9 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { s }$ in 2015 to 22.61 and $2 3 . 1 9 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { s }$ in 2050. The finding is of important meaning for water resources planning purposes, management programs and strategies of the Lake's endangered ecosystem. ",

However, the raw RCM (higher-resolution regional climate model) simulations may stillbe biased (Fowler et al.,20o7).The statistical downscaling methods are based on statistical relationships between large-scale atmospheric variables (predictors)and local climate variables (predictands) (Do et al.,2011; Wilby et al., 2014).

The success of this technique is primarily due to its ability to map highly nonlinear relations between inputs and outputs of the model (Coulibaly et al., 2005). Mendes and Marengo (2010) compared the performance of a temporal neural network model with an autocorrelation statistical downscaling model with emphasis on its ability to reproduce the observed climate variability and tendency for the period 1970-1999 in the Amazon region. The results showed that the neural network model remarkably outperforms the statistical models for the downscaling of daily precipitation variations. Skamarock et al. (2O13) highlighted that ANN (artificial neural network) estimates of rainfall were more accurate than Weather Research and Forecasting model estimates,which applies dynamic downscaling approaches. Campozano et al. (2015) used the statistical downscaling model, the least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) and ANNs to downscale precipitation data over the Paute River Basin in souther Ecuador. The results indicated that LS-SVM and ANNs performed better in downscaling of precipitation data. ",

Also，daily precipitation sums were provided from the global precipitation climatology center (GPCC), providing gridded gauge-analysis products, derived from quality-controlled station data.

In 1957, Rosenblattintroduced the simplest form of feed-forward neural network, called perceptron. But as the inputs were fed directly to the output unit via the weighted connections in the method, it was proved that they could not be trained to distinguish different classes of paterns (Hung et al., 2009). A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward ANN, comprising of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. As the MLP finds non-linear relationships among the nodes, it overcomes many limitations of the single layer perceptron (Lippmann, l987). Two important characteristics of the MLP are: its nonlinear processing elements which have a smooth nonlinearity; and their massive interconnectivity. The effectiveness of an ANN model is gauged by MSE(means quared error） and $R ^ { 2 }$ ，which are derived from comparing the output data with the corresponding target output for the pattern. The best performance can be yielded by specifying the network architecture and by finding the optimal values of connection weights (Hung et al., 2009). ",

HBV-Light requires daily temperature， precipitation and long-term average of potential evaporation values as driving variables.In this study,for the best GCM in the study area,chosen by TOPSIS method,48 possible daily temperature and precipitation series in the twelve O.5-degree cells, derived from the QM method based on the two scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, were available to run the HBV-Light models.First, the HBV-Light models were calibrated and validated to measured streamflow values. For this purpose, the monthly averages of HBV-Light-simulated streamflow were analyzed and were compared to the observed values from 1992 to 2015. Then, these HBV-Light parameter sets were used to simulate streamflow with the corrected GCM simulations as driving conditions between 1992 and 2050.Figure 3 shows the flowchart of the study. ",

Zarrineh River basin faces high pressure on water due to ineffective water resources management, as well as climate change (Abbaspour and Nazaridoust, 2007; Ahmadaali et al.,2018; Alborzi et al., 2018). So,a better understanding of the impact of climate change on water resources in the basin is necessary (Ahmadzadeh et al.,2011; Delju etal.,2013; Nikbakht et al.,2013; Gholampour et al.,2015; Torabi Haghighi and Klove,2017; Ghale et al.,2018). The present study aimed to simulate and project the streamflow of Zarrineh River from 1992 to 2050.For this purpose,a toolbox was developed, comprising the ANN method for downscaling the large-scale data,a bias correction method for generating unbiased climate datasets,a TOPSIS program for choosing the best CMIP5 model and a rainfall-runoff model, namely HBV-Light for investigating the effects of climate change on water resources. The results indicated that the daily mean precipitation is expected to decrease from 0.94 and $0 . 9 6 \\mathrm { m m }$ in 2015 to 0.65 and $0 . 6 8 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ in 2050 based on RCP2.6 and RCP8.5,respectively.

In addition, the annual streamflow of Zarrineh River is expected to decrease by half from 2015 to 2050. ",

To evaluate the robustness of the performances of the methods in different hydrological seasons, the stramflow can be divided into different periods according to the hydrographs.As statistical downscaling methods rely heavily on the assumption that currently observed relationships will carry into the future,using two statistical downscaling methods simultaneously may result in similar consequences for both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.

In spite of the increasing use of GCM simulations in hydro-climatic studies, their direct application is contestable due to the biases. This paper introduces a new approach for forecasting rainfall and temperature, using an ANN technique. To improve its performance,a bias correction method may be used. So,a toolbox was developed, comprising the ANN method,a bias correction and a TOPSIS program, and a rainfall-runoff model, namely the HBV-light model, where the eects of climate change on water resources were investigated. The toolbox was utilized for the case of Zarrineh River basin. Future projections of streamflow revealed that the annual streamflow is expected to decrease by half from 2015 to 2050. ",
