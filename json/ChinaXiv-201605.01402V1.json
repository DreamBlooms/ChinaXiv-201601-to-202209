        "text": "The role of PGE2 in IL-23 production has drawn much attention from many investigators. Study by Sheibanie et al.suggests that PGE2 induces IL-23 production in mouse bone-marrow-derived DCs [8,9]. The result was confirmed by other groups [lo]. Contradictorily, it was reported that PGE2 inhibits IL-23 by human monocytes [1l],indicating that the pro- and anti-inflammatory nature of PGE2 with respect to the governing of IL-23 production may be speciesor cell-type-dependent. DCs are the bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses [12,13].While there were extensive reports showing a positive effect of PGE2 on IL-23 production by mouse bone-marrow-derived DCs, the effect of PGE2 on human DCs in this respect has not been investigated in detail. There are only sporadic reports regarding the effect of PGE2 on IL-23 production by human Mo-DCs.However, these results are not always consistent. Forinstance,it was reported that PGE2 promotes IL-23 production [10,14],while the study by Poloso et al.demonstrated that PGE2 at low concentrations $\\left( 1 { - } 1 0 \\mathrm { n M } \\right)$ promoted IL23 production via EP4 receptors,and at higher $( > 5 0 \\mathrm { n M } )$ ， but still physiologically relevant concentrations $( > 5 0 \\mathrm { n M } )$ ， IL-23 was inhibited by an EP2-mediated mechanism [15]. It suggests that the effect of PGE2 may be dependent on its concentration in the microenvironment. ",

        "text": "In addition,we have demonstrated that PGE2 promotes zymosan-induced (TLR2 ligand) IL-23 production in human Mo-DCs. These results indicate that PGE2 can synergize TLR2 ligand in the promotion of IL-23 production. Our preliminary experiment showed that neither LPS nor R848 alone was a suitable stimulus for induction of IL-23 production in Mo-DCs (data not shown） while zymosan preferentially induced the production of IL-23. These results suggest that expression of IL-23 by Mo-DCs may possess a complicated mode of activation.As is known to us that zymosan exerts its effect mainly through acting on TLR2 and dectin-1 [16,17], however, whether the dectin-1 pathway is involved in the induction ofIL-23 in the present study warrants further study. PGE2 has been demonstrated to exhibit both anti- and proinflammatory effect.Nataraj etal.have demonstrated that PGE2 possesses immunosuppressive effects in both T cells and DCs [18].However, our study strongly suggests that PGE2 is a proinflammatory mediator which promotes the production of IL-23. The differences between the studies may be explained by the differences in model of experiment and cell types. In addition, by using bone-marrow-derived DCs from C57BL/6 mice of different ages,Myer et al. have demonstrated that addition of PGE2 significantly increased IL-23 production by aged DCs whereas IL-23 expression by young DCs was unaffected [19],which indicates that agerelated changes in DCs should be revalued. Furthermore, even in the same cell type, there are seemingly contradictory reports that PGE2 differentially regulates Mo-DCs cytokine responses depending on receptor usage [15]. However, in our studies,PGE2 promoted the production of IL-23 in human Mo-DCs at the concentration $0 { - } 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ .These differences may be explained by the differences in duration of stimuli and mode of action.   \nHowever,our study did not provide any additional ",

        "text": "information about physiologic relevance of the findings in vivo.Taking into account the complexity of the regulation of IL-23 production in Mo-DCs, the in vivo study in mouse model may need to be explored in future study.In addition, our data only indirectly focused on the mechanism of PGE2 on IL-23 production by using cAMP analogues (db-cAMP), adenylate cyclase activator (forskolin),and protein kinase A (PKA）inhibitor (rp-cAMP),respectively. In addition, forskolin often causes massive increases in cAMP,so it was somewhat disconcerting that forskolin is not as good as PGE2 at enhancing IL-23 (Figures 3 and 4(b)).Because forskolin can have nonadenylate cyclase effects,we cannot preclude the possibility that the nonadenylate cyclase effects of forskolin were involved in the experiment.In addition,we could not preclude the possibility that PGE2 may enhance IL-23 production through cAMP independent pathway.Itis of great importance to investigatewhether PGE2 aswell as forskolin increasescAMPinMo-DCsinfurtherwork.

The results not only provide new ideas regarding the regulation of IL-23 production in Mo-DCs in theory, but also suggest an additional mechanism for the proinflammatory role of PGE2,particularly important in autoimmune diseases,suchas rheumatoid arthritis.
