        "text": "Abstract: Jujube (Ziziphus jujube Mill) is a traditional economic forest crop and is widely cultivated in hilly areas of the Loess Plateau, China. However, soil desiccation was discovered in jujube plantations. Pruning is recognized as a water-saving method that can reduces soil water consumption. In this study， we monitored the jujube plots with control (CK), light $\\left( \\mathrm { C } _ { 1 } \\right)$ ，medium $\\left( \\mathbf { C } _ { 2 } \\right)$ and high $( \\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } )$ pruning intensities during the jujube growing period of 2012-2015 to explore the efect of pruning intensity on soil moisture and water use efficiency (WUE) of jujube plantations in the hilly Loess Plateau Region. The results showed that pruning is an effective method for soil water conservation in jujube plantations.Soil moisture increased with increasing pruning intensity during the jujube growing period of $2 0 1 2 { - } 2 0 1 5 . \\ \\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensities increased soil water storage by 6.1-18.3, 14.4-40.O and $2 4 . 3 \\mathrm { - } 6 3 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ ，respectively, compared to CK pruning intensity. Pruning promoted soil moisture infiltration to deper soil layer. Soil moisture infiltrated to soil depths of 240, 280 and $> 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ under ${ \\mathrm { C } } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensity, 220, 260 and 260 cm under $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ pruning intensity, 200, 240 and $2 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ under $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ pruning intensity, and 180, 200 and $1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ （204号 under CK pruning intensity in 2013,2014 and 2015,respectively. Soil water deficit was allviated by higher pruning intensity. In 2013-2015, soil water change was positive under $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ 0 $\\langle 6 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m } \\rangle$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ $( 2 6 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ （20 pruning intensities but negative under $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ $( - 2 0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ and CK $( - 4 0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ pruning intensities. Moreover, pruning significantly improved fresh fruit yield and WUE of jujube plants. Fresh fruit yields were highest under $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ pruning intensity with the values of $6 8 9 7 . 1 - 1 3 , 0 5 9 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { k g / h m ^ { 2 } }$ ，which were 2758.4-4712.8, 385.7-1432.1 and $8 0 2 . 8 { - } 2 3 3 1 . 5 \\mathrm { k g / h m ^ { 2 } }$ higher than those under CK, $C _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensities during the jujube growing period of 2012-2015,respectively. However, $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensity had the highest WUE values of $2 . 9 2 \\mathrm { - } 3 . 1 3 \\mathrm { k g } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ ,which were 1.6-2.0,1.1-1.2 and 1.0-1.1 times greater than those under CK, $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ pruning intensities, respectively. Therefore, ${ \\mathrm { C } } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensity is recommended to jujube plantations for its economic and ecological benefits. These results provide an alternative strategy to mitigate soil desiccation in jujube plantations in the hilly Loess Plateau Region,which is critical for sustainable cultivation of economic forest trees in this region.

In arid and semi-arid areas, excessive depletion of deep soil moisture due to inappropriate vegetation types and long-term drought has made ecological restoration through land use change be difficult (Chen et al.,2Oo8). Soil desiccation also occurs in many other areas of the world, such as Russia, eastern Amazonia and Brazil, where the amount of annual rainfall is lower than that of annual water use (Yang and Han, 1985; Jipp et al.,1998; Oliveira et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2006).

The depth of dried soil layer in a twelve-year-old jujube plantation can reach up to $5 4 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ （Wang et al.，2015） and there almost has no available water in the $2 0 0 { - } 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layer in a nine-year-old jujube plantation (Liu et al., 2014). This suggests that the degree of soil water deficit is worsened over time in jujube plantations (Xin et al.， 2012).

        "text": "Pruning is a common agronomic method used to increase crop yield and fruit quality (Martin et al.,1980; Max et al., 2016), because it can change vegetation structure, improve light energy utilization (Yang et al., 1998; Forrester et al., 20l2) and increase fruit seting rate and soluble sugar content (Pei et al.,2O13). Recently, pruning is recognized as a water-saving method that can reduce soil water consumption (Shelden and Sinclair, 20oo; Lopez et al., 2008; Alcorn et al., 2013). Jackson et al. (2oo0) reported that tree pruning has been used as a part of agroforestry management practices to control water use. Pruning narrows the xylem vessels in Senna spectabilis and reduces the rate of transpiration and water consumption (Namirembe et al., 2009). It reduces the dipping diameter of jujube plant, which in turn increases the soil water storage (Chen et al., 2016). Wei et al. (2014) found a decline in the rate of sap flow in pruned jujube plants,compared with non-pruned plants, especially during the flowering and fruit enlargement periods.Moreover, wedge shapes are observed to form in dead tissues at the cut surfaces of pruned grapes, which affect the properties of catheter and sieve tubes and cause a significant decline in the sap flow rate (Zhao,2O13). Many studies showed that pruning is an effective method for ensuring the normal growth of jujube under drought or water deficit conditions (Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).

Moreover, there were few wel-structured scientific experiments or quantitative analyses concerning pruning intensity and its effect on crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE). In this study, the effects of pruning intensity on the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture and on the tree growth characteristics of jujube plants were determined under natural rainfall conditions in the hilly Loess Plateau Region. The aims of the study were to evaluate the effects of pruning intensity on soil moisture, yield and WUE of jujube plantations, and to find a suitable pruning intensity for soil water conservation, recovery of dried soil layer and soil sustainable productivity. It is our hope that this study could provide scientific reference to prevent environmental degradation in the hilly Loess Plateau Region and to promote the sustainable cultivation of jujube economic forests in hilly regions.

Pruning can be an effective way to reduce tree water use by changing the canopy architecture and reducing canopy leaf area, leading to an improvement in the soil water replenishment rate (Shelden and Sinclair, 2000; Lopez et al.,2008; Hipps et al.,2014; Afonso et al., 2017). However, pruning of tree canopies should be at an appropriate intensity,or it may be more effectively coupled to the atmosphere,as it increases rather than decreases transpiration (Jarvis and Mcnaughton,1986; Wullschleger et al., 2000). Jackson et al. (2000) found that only severe pruning of tree canopies reduced the water requirements of trees. Hipps et al. (2014) also argued that canopy thinning (removal of $30 \\%$ of the lateral branches） had no effect on limiting water demand,whereas canopy reduction (removal of the outer $30 \\%$ of all major branches) conserved soil moisture for up to three years.A similar phenomenon was observed in our study, that is,soil water storage increased under three pruning intensities ( $\\mathrm { \\tilde { C } } _ { 1 }$ $\\mathbf { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { \\dot { \\Omega } }$ ） compared to CK pruning intensity, and high $\\left( \\mathbf { C } _ { 3 } \\right)$ pruning intensity had better water conservation effects.

In the present study, minor or moderate soil water deficit was observed under four pruning intensities. In addition， soil desiccation was somewhat alleviated with increasing pruning intensity. However, the recovery of dried soil layer mainly occurred in the upper soil layer, even under the high pruning intensity. This might be attributable to the extreme drought condition. We also found that the depth of soil moisture infiltration was enhanced and reached up to ${ > } 3 0 0$ cm under $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensity, indicating that pruning promotes the replenishment of deep soil moisture and the recovery of dried soil layer.

This finding indicates that pruning improves the proportions of vegetative and generative plant parts (Ambroszczyk et al., 2Oo7). Many researchers have found that pruning can improve fruit yield and quality by enabling greater access to light, water and nutrients (Reynolds, 1989； Seifi et al.， 2011； Bhagawati et al.，2015). However, we also observed a non-linear relationship between pruning intensity and fruit yield. Jujube plants under $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ pruning intensity had the highest yield, so pruning within a limited range of intensity had a positive effect. Jorquerafontena et al.

Previous researchers proposed a conceptual \"water-saving pruning measure\" to control soil desiccation in jujube plantations (Zhao et al., 2Ol2). According to this strategy, soil water content determines the fruit yield and fruit yield determines the tree size. Similarly, our results further implied that local average annual rainfal, soil moisture status and the physiological characteristics of jujube plants determine the yield and then the appropriate yield determines the canopy structure of tree. Zhao et al. (2O12） showed that a sustainable water-saving pruning strategy is not only based on the maximum yield, but also should avoid excessve use of soil moisture for sustainable management of plantations. In the present study, compared with $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ ，although $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ pruning intensity produced the highest yield, it had the lowest WUE. Furthermore, $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensity produced the highest WUE and also an acceptable yield. Therefore, in the range of pruning intensities tested, $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ pruning intensity is recommended for its economic and ecological benefits.
