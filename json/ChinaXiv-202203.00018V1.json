Based on the data in the past 26 years, the statistics focused on whether the daily return (revenue) of Shanghai Index shows significant value and special feature on and after each solar term. On several solar terms did the index return result large mean value and high probability of extreme value occurrence such as on solar term No.1 and No.3 while on solar term No.2 and solar term No.4,the results were completely opposite. The study also found that the volatility of index return during those solar terms in the beginning of the year were greatly active than the rest of them. Index return 10 days and 15days after solar term No.6 and solar term No.8 displayed high final return and large volatility whereas in any cases, the index went very steady after solar term No.18. The study also proposed that it's almost impossible to make numeric prediction with the current technical analysis tools,the effective way in stock analysis to collect more feature and characteristics based on historical data, identifying if the similar situation is happening when similar feature of stock shows up in the future.

Gann developed a series of time divisions (which surprisingly coincide with the time points of Chinese twenty-four solar terms), time cycles and season features to make predictions to stock trend whereas Eliot suggested the shape of stock conforms to the waves in the ocean, proposing a regulation of five rising waves and three falling waves in every circulation.It's easy to see that they all came to a consensus that the stock market can be not only studied by fundamental analysis and conventional technical analysis but, more importantly, some natural factors would lye positive outcomes and special features when applying on stock analysis.

It focused on how to define and screen turning points as well as how many of them are valid to a nearby solar terms by selecting certain time radius with different levels of range of extreme points.The article also clarified the logic with Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and time cycle theory in conducting stock trend predictions.

In traditional Chinese culture, there are 36O days roughly in a year divided into 24 different solar terms which means that there are 15 days during each solar term on average. Solar term comes one after another like a time duration as each solar term domains the following 14 days (i.e. altogether 15 days on average). Every solar term has a different name and a unique meaning (which we will display them later), showing the change and feature of the seasons in different levels. Today's twenty-four solar terms are based on the position of the sun on the ecliptic.That's the annual motion track of the sun which is divided into 24 equal parts, each $1 5 ^ { \\circ }$ is one part as $1 ^ { \\circ }$ equals one day and a year equals $3 6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . In other Words, Chinese Twenty-four Solar Terms can be regarded as 24 seasons in China instead of the common four seasons (Spring, Summer,Fall and Winter) which we are using internationally nowadays. The Chinese Twenty-four Solar Terms is a fantastic refinement and summary of the change and transition of climate. It tells farmer when to sow, when to grow and when to harvest. Surprisingly, the climate always show significant fluctuation (e.g. obvious rise or fall of temperature, snowing, heavy rain, etc.) on the same day when a solar term falls. This kind of change of climate usually lasts in the rest days this solar term domains until the next solar term arrive.In addition, the 15- days duration of each solar term is further divided into three 5-days periods as three “Hou” in Chinese.

Different blocks of indices represent different aspects of economy and major indices show the overall status of the stock market. ETF funds greatly neutralize the abnormal fluctuation brought by individual stocks and more importantly, they have features and rules to follow as it's much easier to apply technical analysis to win in ETF funds than individual stocks.Luckily,ETF funds in active block also show very high percentage of daily returns and volatility, not much less than some individual stock.

However, idealistic status in stock market is far more dificult to realize than Newton's one.

On the other hand, stock market consist of numerous investors and financial organizations who wouldn't be, and always not, absolutely rational, technically professional, enough sensitive to information or having a firm and confident mind.

We have the probabilities above, finding that in many cases the absolute probability is not that significant even though one is efficient solar term. In other words, despite one is efficient solar term, in may not always bring significant volatility in its following days, it also depend on the activeness of the year. In active years such as bull market and bear market, efficient solar term will boost (or strengthen) the daily return or volatility based on its unique feature, in common year, its feature are not expressed apparently.
