In particular,the unsteadinessand turbulence of wind in Japan are stronger than ones in Europe and North America in general.Hence,Japanese engineers should take account of the velocity unsteadiness of natural wind at installed open-air location to design a higher performance wind turbine. Using the originally designed five wind turbines on the basis of NACA and MEL blades,the dependencies ofthe wind frequency and vortex scale of the simulated natural wind are presented.As the results,the power coeficient of the newly designed MEL3-type rotor in the simulated natural wind is $1 3 0 \\%$ larger than one in steady wind.
