        "text": "$\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ is a better candidate tool to modulate epithelial barrier than other C-terminal fragments of CPE.First of all,the $\\mathrm { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ is shown to strongly interact with Cldns in a subtypespecifc manner.The C-terminal region 290-319 of CPE is sufficient for its binding to Cldns (19).However,longer CPE fragments have stronger binding capacity (2O).The crystal structure of $\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ shows that region 290-319 is only the core Cldnbinding domain formed by strands $\\beta 8$ and $\\beta 9$ (21).In contrast, the $\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ contains a nine-strand $\\beta$ -sandwich which forms the whole Cldn-binding domain (21). Second,the $\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ specifically and reversibly regulates Cldn proteins.In MDCK-I cells,cCPEl84-319 was reported to interact with Cldn4 but not with Cldnl (12)． In accordance, the results here show that $\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ specifically binds to and removes Cldn4 in MDCK-I cells as well as removes Cldnb,the homolog of Cldn4 in zebrafish. The molecular mechanism of the interaction between cCPE/CPE and mammalian Claudins was analysed in detail (18,19,22-24). The published data,the findings of this study and the sequence of the ECL2 of Cldnb especially in the turn region (149NPLVV153) which is very similar to the cCPE binding motif (NPL/MVA/P) make a direct interaction between Cldnb and cCPE very likely. Importantly, the reduction of Cldns by $\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ is reversible. Washing out of $\\mathrm { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ could restore the expression of Cldns. $\\mathrm { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ reversibly opens TJs most likely due to the dynamic assembly and disassembly of TJs(25,26）and sequestration of Cldns by cCPE preventing their incorporation in TJ strands. Within the 24-h recovery time,new Cldn molecules can be synthesized and transported to the plasma membrane where they participate in the formation of TJ strands.In addition,after washing out,dissociation of cCPE from Cldns might also reduce Cldn sequestration.Finally,like other C-terminal fragments of CPE,the $\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ transiently breaches epithelial barrier without significant toxic effects.In a previous toxicological study, Suzuki et al. (27）also showed that intravenous administration $( 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g } )$ or nasal cCPE administration $( 2 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g } )$ did not increase indicative biochemical markers of liver and kidney injuries.Incubation of zebrafish with $\\mathsf { c C P E } _ { 1 9 4 - 3 1 9 }$ induced pericardial oedema due to disruption of epithelial barrier.However,the treated zebrafish recovered well after exchanging freshwater.
