        "text": "Cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera,is a major insect pest that feeds on cotton bols causing extensive damage leading to crop and productivity loss.In spite of such a major impact,cotton plant response to bollworm infection is yetto be witnessed.In this context,we have studied the genome-wide response of cotton bols infested with bollworm using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches.Further,we have validated this data using semi-quantitative real-time PCR.Comparative analyses have revealed that $3 9 \\%$ of the transcriptome and $3 5 \\%$ of the proteome were differentially regulated during bollworm infestation.Around $3 6 \\%$ of significantly regulated transcriptsand $45 \\%$ of differentially expressed proteins were found to be involved in signalling followed by redox regulation.Further analysis showed that defence-related stress hormones and their lipid precursors,transcription factors,signaling molecules,etc.were stimulated,whereas the growth-related counterparts were suppressed during bollworm infestation. Around $2 6 \\%$ of the significantly up-regulated proteins were defence molecules, while $5 5 0 \\%$ of the significantly down-regulated were related to photosynthesis and growth. Interestingly，the biosynthesis genes for synergistically regulated jasmonate,ethylene and suppressors of the antagonistic factor salicylate were found to be up-regulated,suggesting a choice among stress-responsive phytohormone regulation.Manual curation of the enzymes and TFs highlighted the components of retrograde signalling pathways. Our data suggest that a selective regulatory mechanism directs the reallocation of metabolic resources favouring defence over growth under bollworm infestation and these insights could be exploited to develop bollworm-resistant cotton varieties.

Hormones are secondary signals that amplify primary elicitor signals during biotic stress (Yang et al.，1997). Salicylic acid (SA),ethylene (ET), jasmonic acid (JA) and systemin are the major phytohormones that are often quoted as stressspecific signallingmolecules (Arimura et al.，2oo5;Loake and Grant,2007;Sun et al.，2011;Yang et al.，1997).Moran and Thompson (20o1） suggested that there is a complex crosstalk among hormonal pathways that control the plant responses to wounds， insect pest and pathogen attacks. In addition to hormones,pathogen elicitors also activate TFs that interacts with the pathogen-responsive cis elements present in the promoters of the defence-related genes.Even a single pathogen elicitor is capable of activating multiple TFs that can interact with the cis elements present within the same or different promoter regions ultimately leading to stimulation of vast set of defence-related genes and gene products (Yang et al.，1997). Oxidative burst is oneof the major processes that occur during biotic stress condition (Lamb and Dixon，1997).Maintenance of the redox balance within the plant cell plays a crucial role in modulating redox sensitive genes and proteins including many TFs (Torres, 2010).Release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as $\\mathsf { O } _ { 2 } ^ { - }$ and ${ \\sf H } _ { 2 } { \\sf O } _ { 2 }$ induces many defence-related events including cell wall reinforcement through lignifications and cross-linking of glycoproteins in the extracellular matrix,activation of defence-related genes,molecules,etc. (Jabs et al.，1997).The above-mentioned cascade of events demand and consume considerable amount of energy.During stress conditions，plant systems manage their biological energy and resources by either partitioning or favouring the molecular machineries towards defence and/or growth.As a result，most plants do survive insect predation;however,it is often accompanied byreduced growth and yield penalty depending on the site of insect predation.

        "text": "Cotton (Gossypium spp.） is the leading contributor of natural fibre and is an important source of textile commodity,oil and protein meal (Han et al.,2004; Mei et al.,2004). Cotton bolls are crucial tissues that harbour lint (textile fibre)which is of huge economic value.The effect of insect pest infestation followed by secondary infection could lead up to $80 \\%$ loss in cotton fibre production (Oerke,2006).Around 1326 species of insects have been reported worldwide as cotton pests，and among them, bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera)is the major pest that directly feed and destroy the developing fibre tissue within the cotton bolls (Dua et al.，2006;Matthews,1994). Biotic stress induced through insect pestattack regulates cellular eventsmajorlydriven byexpression changes of genes and their associated pathways. Earlier efforts to understand plant diseases caused by insect, pathogen infestations have identified certain genes and pathways involved in the biotic stress tolerance in cotton (Artico et al., 2014;Dubey et al.，2013；Gao et al.，2013).Systems level analysisat the transcriptand protein levelsmore often reveals the near-complete status of an organism subjected to stress or disease conditions (Komatsu et al.,20o9;Srivastava et al.,2013). Suchanalyses are yet to be employed to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms operational during cotton plant and bollworm interactions.Further understanding of these interactions using high-throughput approaches might reveal stressinduced responses and endogenous resistance mechanisms operational in the host. In this context，we have made an attempt to understand the mechanisms adapted by cotton plant during bollworm attack using both transcriptomic and proteomic tools.As bolls are the target site for fibre synthesis as well as bollworm feeding，we have performed comparative analyses of developing cotton bolls subjected to bollworm infestation.Our comprehensive genome-wide analyses have revealed several new andinteresting insights about cotton plant and bollworm interactions. Knowledge gained through this study could be further exploited to develop bollworm-resistant cotton varieties. ",

Differentially expressed transcripts and DEPs related to trehalose, raffinose，malate，starch and cell wall metabolism majorly accounted for the carbohydrate metabolism (Table S9).Briefly, up-regulated transcripts related to trehalose phosphate synthase (TPS)and trehalose phosphatase (TPP) that are involved in trehalose biosynthesis (Tables 2 and S9)were identified in this study(Wingler，2oo2).Two unique isoforms ofgalactinol synthases (GolS) involved in galactinol synthesis were found to be consistently up-regulated in our data set (Tables 2，S4,and S9).Further,our study also showed the up-regulated transcripts of malate synthase (MS) and down-regulated malate dehydrogenase (MDH) transcriptsand proteins (Tables S9 and S14).Malate synthase is involved in the synthesis of malate，whereas MDH catalyses the oxidation of malate to pyruvate and ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ The above-mentioned pattern in turn correlates with stress-responsive accumulationoftrehalose，raffinoseand malate in the infested bolls.In plants，synthesis and degradation of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs)such as starch plays a major role in the regulation of carbon source availability during growthand unfavourable conditions (Sulpice et al.，2oo9).Data curation revealed the down-regulated transcripts involved in starch biosynthesis such as starch synthase,ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and up-regulated enzymes of starch degradation pathway such as starch excess 1 and starch binding domaincontaining glycoside hydrolase (Yano et al.,2oo5) (Table 2，S1). Further analysis showed the down-regulated group of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) that catalyse cell wall metabolism-related processes such as loosening,elongation,grafting and maturation (Table S7).Analysis of nitrogen，amino acid and protein metabolism genes revealed that glutamine metabolism wasup-regulated and ubiquitin cascade-related genes were differentially regulated.Pathway curation revealed that glutamine synthase isoform 1 (GS1)，glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and nitrate reductase (NiR)involved in nitrogen metabolism were found to be up-regulated (Tables S4 and S14).In case of ubiquitin cascade,we observed that ubiquitin ligase (E3)was up-regulated, whereas ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) was down-regulated in BS condition at transcript and protein levels (Tables S4,S11, and S14).This in turn suggests the onset of rate limiting pattern orcontrolled proteolysis through ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during stress.In addition to the metabolic enzymes, we also observed up-regulated members of both sugarand amino acid transporters throughout the developmental stages suggesting active transportation processes (Table S12).Further,our study also revealed that fatty acid and lipid metabolism-related genes were differentially regulated (Table S1O). Pathway mapping and curation suggested stimulation as well as repression of different lipid precursor pathways.Briefly，majority of the up-regulated genes were involved in glycolipid and phospholipid metabolism including enzymes related to $\\mathfrak { a }$ -linolenicacid metabolismthat ultimately lead to JA biosynthesis (Tables S10 and S14).On the other hand,we observed that down-regulated genes such as 3- oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase (DET 2）and 24-sterol Cmethyltransferase (SMT2-2)were involved in sterol biosynthesis.

Genes encoding ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + } ,$ /calmodulin-binding proteins,calcineurin Blikeproteins, ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ binding EF-hand family proteins, ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ dependent ATPases were found to be up-regulated under BS conditions (Tables 1 and S14).Protein kinase cascades account for the major contributors of induced immunity in plants.In this study，we observed the up-regulation of two major stressactivated protein kinases such as calcium-dependent protein kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases.Also，other kinases such as SNF1(sucrose nonfermenting)-related protein kinase，calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase-6 (CIPK6), ankyrin protein kinases were found to be significantlyupregulated in BS condition.The above-mentioned ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ signalling molecules can be broadly classified into nonenzymatic sensor proteins and enzymatic proteins.These proteins together constitute a network that not only maintains the intracellular calcium levels but are also involved in other signalling events includingproteinactivation.Amongthe ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ -dependent enzymes，majority were observed to be kinases involved in phosphorylation reaction that determines the activity of substrate protein molecules.So we further analysed the data sets for kinase substrates and the pathways regulated by these kinases during stress. Interestingly,we observed CDPK-activated protein substrates such as NADPH oxidases and oxidoreductases that were up-regulated during later stages of development (10dpa) (Dubiella et al.，2013).Manual curation of data sets revealed that members of peroxidases，superoxide dismutases (SODs),glutathione S-transferases (GSTs),etc.were found to be differentially regulated at transcript and protein levels (Tables S13 and S14).These enzymes are actively involved in the ROS metabolism leading to detoxification reactions and activation of downstream signalling cascades.

Isochorismatase hydrolase (ISH)was the only SA biosynthetic pathway-related enzyme that was found to be up-regulated in our data set (Table S1). However,pathway annotation revealed that ISH catalyses the conversion of isochorismic acid to 2，3- dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB)and this reaction does not necessarily lead to SA biosynthesis in plants (Figure 6). Interestingly, most of the crucial enzymes involved in JA biosynthesis including phospholipase A，lipoxygenase，allene oxide synthase (AOS), allene oxide cyclase (AOC) and acyl-coA oxidase were found to beup-regulated throughout the developmental stages in BSinduced bolls at transcript and protein levels (Tables S1O and S14).Expression pattern of the hormonal biosynthesis-related genes suggests that biotic stress has induced JA and ET that are reported to act in a cooperative fashion (Figure 6).Likewise, ABA being the major contributor for DETs showed downregulated pattern leading to its suppression during biotic stress. Down-regulation of BR and partial stimulation of auxin provides clues about the rate limiting pattern for allowing growth during stress. ",

The concordant pattern observed among the transcript-protein pairs such as chitinase, PR proteins,carbonic anhydrase and protease inhibitors adds significance and direct evidence for active defence signalling duringbollworm infestation in developing cotton bolls.Also, discordance observed among transcript-protein pairs might reflect true biological discordance that could be attributed to post-transcriptional regulations,protein/transcript stability，miRNAs,etc.and this needs to be investigated further. On the whole, our data suggest that employing two complementary approaches have increased the overall coverage of the differentially expressed genes that in turn has aided in filling crucial gaps in the abovementioned processes.

In addition to that,carbohydrate active and associated proteins like CAZymes，AGPs and FLAs were found to be differentially regulated in our data set (TableS7).AGPs are a heterogeneousclass ofabundant proteoglycans localized in both cell wall and cytosolic regions (Kumar et al.,2013). Reactive oxygen species molecules $( \\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \\mathsf { O } _ { 2 } )$ released during stress conditions,cross-link the AGPs to the cell wall leading to rigidity and thereby render protection against pest and pathogen invasion.The rigidity caused in the cell wall matrix also acts as a negative regulator of cell growth (Cleland and Karlsnes，1967；Gille et al.，2009；Sadava and Chrispeels, 1973).

In plants,glutamine (Gln) serves as the primary source for inorganic nitrogen，N $( \\mathsf { N O } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ and $N H _ { 4 } ^ { + }$ ）that gets subsequently utilized for biosynthesis of major amino acids like Glu,Asp and Asn. Among the genes involved in nitrogen/amino acid metabolism,glutamine synthetase (GS),glutamate synthase,GDH and NiR play primary rolesin theassimilation of $N H _ { 4 } ^ { + }$ .Two isoforms of GSare reported in plants among which GS1 is induced and the other isoform,GS2 is suppressed during pathogen attack (Pageau et al.，2006). Interestingly,our study revealed the consistent up-regulation of GS1，GDH and NiR under BS condition．Among the above mentioned，GS2 and NiR are involved in primary nitrogen assimilation，whereas GS1 and GDH are involved in organic nitrogen remobilization (Pageau et al.，2oo6). In addition，GS1 and GDH are also cited as senescence-related markers in plants (Pageau et al.,2oo6). Expression pattern observed in the current study in turn suggests that nitrogen remobilization and senescence leading to stress regulation is active，whereas signals related to primary nitrogen assimilation leading to growth are not evidenced.

Briefly, linolenic acid metabolic enzymes were up-regulated，whereas sterol biosynthesis genes were down-regulated. Linolenic acid and sterols are lipid molecules colocalized within the plastid and thylakoid membranes (Schwertner and Biale，1973).Our data showed that the factors related to linolenic acid metabolism leading to biosynthesis of stress-responsive JA were induced,while the genes related to sterol biosynthesis that leads to growth-related Br synthesis were down-regulated.Interestingly,cellular component-based annotation of the above-mentioned pathways and processes revealed that growth and defence-related molecules are colocalized within the same compartment such as chloroplast. However，under biotic stress,only defence-related factors are positively regulated leaving behind the growth-related factors (Figure 6). Such a switch over in the regulation oflipid metabolism at subcellular level further ensures resistance during bollworm attack. ",

These enzymes catalyse reactions leading to ROS release which further stimulates downstream enzymes like SODs and GSTs localized at other cellular components.Superoxide dismutases and GSTs catalyse detoxification reactions，while PCBRsare involved in antioxidant synthesis ultimately protecting cells from oxidative stress (Niculaes et al.，2014).Temporal expression of the ROS scavengers indicates a compromised pattern executed by cotton bols in response to bollworm attack.Phytohormones are secondary signals that often regulate development and stress conditions in plants.Our study showed the positive regulation of stress-related hormones such JA and ethylene accompanied by repression or down-regulation of growth-related Auxin，BR (Figure 5). Interestingly，we did not find genes related to SA biosynthesis which is also a biotic stress-specific hormone; however，positively regulated suppressors for SA synthesis such as EIN3 and WRKY 33 have been evidenced in the current study (Table 2； Figure 6).Such observations in turn suggest that bollworm attack favours synergistic JA-ethylene synthesis over the antagonistic SA.Further，our study also revealed the upregulation of nuclear encoded plastid and mitochondrial components including TFs and enzymes.Among them，WRKY TF family is often linked with biotic stress response and pathogenassociated molecular pattern (PAMP) (Eulgem and Somssich, 2007;Rushton et al.，1996).In addition,WRKY TFs also regulate the expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins (Van Aken et al.，2013)．For example； up-regulated members of WRKY40 identified in the current study are known to regulate the expression of AOX enzyme during stress conditions (lvanova et al.,2014).These factors along with ROS molecules together constitute the plastid and mitochondrial signalling pathway components that regulates nuclear gene expression related to cell cycle and growth.Such pattern further revealsthe retrograde trend operational during biotic stress conditions (Fiqure 6).

Following stress perception，a series of signal transduction events that include metabolic pathway regulation,defence molecule synthesis,etc.are stimulated to encounter the external attack (Figure S3).The above-mentioned coordinated events suggest an energy intensive mechanism that needs to be executed in order to exert the defence response. Knowledge gained through the current study highlights that the source for such additional energy couldbe attained by suppressing growth locally (boll tissue growth). In short，we observed a hierarchy of factors and processes that specifically suppresses growth-related events and stimulates defence-related processes. Expression trend of carbohydrate，amino acid and lipid metabolism also reveals the synthesis of stress response-related molecules such as trehalose, raffinose,linolenic acid and suppression of growth-related factors such as cell wall elongation enzymes,and sterols.Suppression of fundamental processes such as photosynthesis and cell cycle not only retards further growth but also regulates the amount of ROS released by them and also preserves considerable amount of energy that could be channelized for defence signalling. Likewise, defence response such as lignifications,cross-linking of proteoglycans to cell wall matrix offers cell wall rigidification on the one hand and negatively regulates cellular expansion on the other. All these factors together suggest a major reallocation of metabolic resources favouring defence over growth through selective regulation of specific pathways and processes during bollworm attack. ",
