DFPSCAT is one of three payloads proposed for WCOM along with other two payloads， the Full Polarization Interferometric Radiometer (FPIR） and the Polarimetric Microwave Imager (PMI).DFPSCAT is mainly used to retrieve the SWE by simultaneous measurement of both surface and volume scattering from snow coverage [2, 3].According to requirement of the retrieval, the surface resolution of normalized radar backscatter coefficient (sigmaO) measured by DFPSCAT should be about approximate $2 \\mathrm { k m }$ ，and with high radiometric precision. Subjected to restriction of scanning coverage and rotation speed, the beamwidth and antenna dimension ofDFPSCAT are about $1 ^ { \\circ }$ and $1 . 5 \\mathrm { m }$ ，respectively.To achieve the desired spatial resolution,pulse compression is adopted along the elevation direction; while along the azimuth direction, Doppler Beam Sharpening(DBS） can be used at sidelooking region within the swath.
