        "text": "Abstract: Corn straw return to the field is a vital agronomic practice for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC)and its labile fractions，as well as soil aggregates and organic carbon (OC) associated with Water-stable aggregates (WSA). Moreover, the labile SOC fractions play an important role in OC turnover and sequestration. The aims of this study were to determine how different corn straw returning modes affect the contents of labile SOC fractions and OC associated with WSA. Corn straw was returned in the following depths: (1) on undisturbed soil surface (NTS), (2) in the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil depth (MTS),(3) in the $0 { - } 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil depth (CTS),and (4) no corn straw applied (CK).After five years (2014-2018), soil was sampled in the O-20 and $2 0 { \\ - } 4 0 \\ \\mathrm { ~ c m }$ depths to measure the water-extractable organic C (WEOC), permanganate oxidizable C $( \\mathrm { K M n O } _ { 4 } \\mathrm { - C } ) ,$ , light fraction organic C (LFOC),and WSA fractions. The results showed that compared with CK,corn straw amended soils (NTS, MTS and CTS) increased SOC content by $1 1 . 5 5 \\% { - } 1 6 . 5 8 \\%$ ，WEOC by $4 1 . 3 8 \\% - 5 1 . 4 2 \\% ,$ ： ${ \\mathrm { K M n O } } _ { 4 } .$ C and LFOC by $2 9 . 8 4 \\% - 3 4 . 0 9 \\%$ and $5 6 . 6 8 \\% { - } 6 5 . 3 6 \\%$ in the $0 { - } 4 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil depth. The LFOC and $\\mathrm { K M n O } _ { 4 } .$ C were proved to be the most sensitive fractions to different corn straw returning modes. Compared with CK,soils amended with corn straw increased mean weight diameter by $2 4 . 2 4 \\% - 4 0 . 4 8 \\%$ in the $\\mathrm { 0 - 2 0 ~ c m }$ soil depth. The NTS and MTS preserved more than $6 0 . 0 0 \\%$ of OC in macro-aggregates compared with CK. No significant difference was found in corn yield across allcorn straw returning modes throughout the study period,indicating that adoption of NTS and MTS would increase SOC content and improve soil structure,and would not decline crop production.

This practice increases direct mineralization of soil organic matter by soil microbes. In contrast, returning corn straw to the soil has been shown as alternative practices to reverse losses of SOC content and improve labile SOC fractions (Bongiorno et al. 2019; Mi et al.,2019). Mi et al. (2019） showed that returning crop straw into the soil improved SOC content by $2 8 . 0 0 \\%$ in the $0 { - } 2 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ soil depth, compared with non-straw amended soils. ",

Therefore,maintaining soil carbon(C) balance is of utmost importance for improving soil quality and C sequestration. Up to date, bulk SOC content is commonly used to assess the changes in soil quality. However, changes in SOC content induced by soil management practices are often difficult to detect, due to the high background values of soil C (Gregorich et al.,1994), and slow turnover rates(Yang et al.,2Ol2).For these reasons,there is the need to evaluate reliable and sensitive indicators that may serve to assess the changes in soil quality.

These fractions have faster turnover rates and they respond rapidly to the changes in soil management practices.For instance, in a three-year study, Chen et al. (2017) did not observe significant changes in bulk SOC content after crop straw residues were returned, but MBC, POC,WEOC and LFOC contents were significantly increased. Therefore,assessing labile SOC fractions provide a useful index to monitor the capacity of soil to sequester C,given that labile SOC fractions are the essential for the formation of more stable SOC.In addition to the labile SOC fractions,evaluation of carbon management index (CMI) can give the precise direction on the effects induced by soil management practices on SOC dynamics.The CMI monitors whether a soil is rehabilitating or deteriorating (Blair et al.,1994),and the increase in CMI can indicate rehabilitating soil ecosystem (Li et al., 2018; Mi et al., 2019).

Lastly, the potential contribution of building SOC as a means to increase corn production has not yet been sufficiently quantified in spite of a significant relationship between SOC and corn yield (Oldfoeld et al.,2O19),and there is little consensus as to whether corn yields are maintained or yield increases or decreases after crop straw application (Song et al., 2O15; Si et al., 2O18; Song et al.,2019). In light to these inconsistences,a five-year (2014-2018) study was conducted in Haplic Cambisol to evaluate the effects of four different corn straw returning modes on: （1） the contents of labile SOC fractions and assessing which labile SOC fraction is the most sensitive to soil management practices；(2） water stable aggregates (WSA） and SOC distribution in aggregate-size fractions; and (3) crop yield. We expect that returning corn straw willincrease the contents of labile SOC fractions and improve soil aggregation. ",

As a C rich substance,application of corn straw serves as a C substrate for microbes and replenishes SOC content (Ndzelu et al.,，2O2O),thereby contributing to the build-up of SOC. Comparing al corn straw returning modes,we found that NTS was considered to be more beneficial in increasing SOC content (Table 1). The result could be atributed to the surface retention of corn straw on undisturbed soil. Pu et al.(2O19) also showed that returning crop residues on undisturbed soil significantly improved SOC content. Absence of soil disturbance decreases aggregate turnover, which in turn physically protects organic matter against microbial mineralization. In contrast, removal of corn straw and intensive tilage,for example, CK treatment breaks soil macro-aggregates, thus exposing organic matter to soil microbial mineralization (Six et al., 2O02),which explains lower SOC content under CK compared with other treatments. Therefore, NTS followed by MTS is the better practice to protect SOC against mineralization in Haplic Cambisol. ",

Similar to other studies,we demonstrated that five years of corn straw application significantly increased the contents of labile SOC fractions compared with non-amended soils (Table 2).This indicates that soil was enriched with labile SOC fractions after corn straw application. During corn straw transformation and decomposition， Zhang et al.(2O2O） observed that some water-soluble substances and labile organic compounds(Chen et al., 2Oo9) are released into the soil. Among all six labile SOC fractions measured herein, ${ \\bf K M n O _ { 4 } .

This is because tillage incorporated corn straw into the soil under MTS and CTS treatments,which increased soil contact, thereby allowing microbes to access straw for rapid transformation and mineralization (Ndzelu et al., 2020). As a result, some portions of labile compounds are utilized by microbes as a source of energy during corn straw transformation.The increase in the contents of labile SOC fractions with soil depth under CTS (Table 2) was caused by redistribution of labile SOC fraction to deeper soil depth because of tillage.Lastly, decrease in the contents of labile SOC fractions under CK is attributed to absence of corn straw and intensive tillage,which intensified organic matter decomposition and resulted in rapid mineralization of labile SOC fractions.Bongiorno et al. (2019)drew similar observation that conventional tillage decreased labile SOC fractions. Our results indicate that amending soil with corn straw residues will increase the contents of labile SOC fractions,and NTS is more conducive in increasing these fractions. ",

Similar results were observed in previous studies (Kubar et al.,2O18; Gao et al.,2O19; Sithole et al., 2019; Song et al., 2O19), where macro-aggregates in soils amended with crop straw residues preserved more C than aggregates of smaller sizes,because macro-aggregates physically protected organic mater in these aggregates against chemical and biological mineralization (Six et al., 2002). By decreasing soil aggregate turnover, NTS limited organic C accessibility by soil microbes, which in turn stimulated SOC sequestration compared with other treatments (Fig. 2). This result was confirmed by CPC analysis， where macro-aggregates exhibited higher CPC than other aggregate-size fractions (Fig. 3)，and suggested the importance of macro-aggregates in C sequestration (Table 6). It was observed that incorporating corn straw residues into the soil with tillage as was the case of MTS and CTS decreased SOC associated with macro-aggregates (Fig. 2), because tillage broke down soil aggregates. These results suggest that protecting SOC in macro-aggregates from mineralization might be more important to the C sequestration and build-up of SOC content. The SOC associated with $< 0 . 0 5 3 \\ \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ fractions did not exhibit a significant difference across allcorn straw returning modes and soil depths,illustrating that C in these fractions was stabilized by strong organo-mineral interactions.Soil C in this form has slow turnover and is stabilized for longer periods.

(2017) in northern China, which reported no significant changes in corn yield after converting from CK to corn straw return. This means that application of corn straw will not decline corn production, but will significantly improve soil quality. Most studies suggest that long-term application of corn straw could potentially improve corn yield (Song et al., 2O15),because SOC took several years or decades to build-up.This might explain no significant increase in corn yields across al treatments since our study was conducted for only five years. Oldfield et al. (2O19) showed that greater corn yield is significantly correlated with a higher SOC content. Improvement in soil quality in our study could be atributed to the enhanced labile SOC fractions and soil aggregation and lowered bulk density caused by the application of corn straw. ",
