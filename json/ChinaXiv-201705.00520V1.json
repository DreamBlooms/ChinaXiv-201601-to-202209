However, these methods are not suitable for the practical applications due to their complicated and high cost synthesis process. More recently, pioneered by Cui et al.[16],another effective way to accommodate the volume expansion is to engineer pores inside the Si based electrode by removing the sacrificing particles embedded in the fabrication process.In previous work in our group，porous $\\mathsf { S i } / \\mathsf { C }$ composites have been successfully fabricated by etchingaway the sacrificing $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ nanoparticles,which finally reveal a high capacity of around $8 0 0 \\mathrm { \\ m A h \\ g ^ { - 1 } }$ for over 200 cycles [17].However,in most works related to porous Si based electrodes, $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ is widely used as the skeleton or sacrificing material,and has to be removed by HF solution considering the dissolution of Si in alkaline solution.Itis known thatHF is quite harmful and has to be carefully handled,which greatly influence the application of porous Si electrodes in practice.Therefore,a cheap and environmentfriendly approach is significantly important and urgently required for the development of practical high performance Si-based anode.

Six additional reflections in the Si/C-122 before washing correspond well with the diffractions of NaCl (JCPDS no. 88-230O).After washing the sample,there is no evidence of NaCl in both ${ \\mathrm { S i } } / { \\mathrm { C } } { - 1 2 0 }$ and $\\mathrm { \\sf S i } / \\mathrm { \\sf \\Lambda }$ C122 after washing. In addition,energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)analysis of SC-122 after washing demonstrates that there is no Na and Cl element as seen in Fig. S2 in Supporting information, which confirms that NaCl in composite has been washed away completely. The broad curve at $2 0 { - } 2 7 ^ { \\circ }$ suggests the nature of amorphous carbon,which is due to the carbonization of sucrose. TG result in Fig.2b indicates that there is $58 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ active Si in $\\mathrm { S i } / \\mathrm { C - }$ 122 composite and $6 1 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ active Si in Si/C-120 composite.To further confirm the internal structural characteristics of these composites,the specific surface area were investigated through the BET $\\mathsf { N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption-desorption isotherms at $7 7 \\mathrm { K } ,$ as shown in Fig.2c and d. The typical type Ill $\\mathsf { N } _ { 2 }$ adsorption-desorption isotherms of Si/C-122 imply that it composed by macroporous structures.In contrast, the isotherms were not obvious and no hysteresis loop was observed in Si/C-120.As expected,the BET specific surfaceareasincreasefrom $6 7 \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ in $\\bar { \\mathrm { S i } } / \\mathrm { C } - 1 2 0 { - } 1 7 6 \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { \\bf g } ^ { - 1 }$ in $\\mathsf { S i } / \\mathsf { C } \\mathsf { - } 1 2 2$ .

However,the cycling stability has been significantly improved that the discharge capacity still remains at about $6 0 0 \\mathrm { m A h } \\ \\mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ after 100 cycles.The cycle life can be further enhanced by increasing the content of $_ { \\mathsf { N a C l } }$ to $40 \\mathrm { { w t \\% } }$ in Si/C-122 sample,which can deliver a high discharge capacity of $1 3 9 4 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at the first cycle, $9 7 7 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at the second cycle, $9 3 6 \\mathrm { m A h } \\ \\mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ at the 10th cycle. The total loss in the first 1O cycle is $3 3 \\%$ ，while the discharge capacity would be stable from the 2rd to 1Oth cycle with a capacity loss of $3 . 9 \\%$ .Finally,the discharge capacity can be remained over $7 4 0 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ after 10o cycles with capacity retention of $78 \\%$ Here, the tap density of Si/C-122 nanoporous composite was examined to be around $0 . 5 9 \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ ，which is much lower than that of the commonly used graphite based anode,such as: MCMB of $1 . 2 { - } 1 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ .However, it isworth tomention thatits corresponding gravimetric capacity reachesa stable capacity of $9 5 0 \\mathrm { m A h / g }$ from the 2nd cycle,that is almost three times higher than that of the graphite based anode of $3 2 0 \\mathrm { m A h / g }$ .Thus,the overall volumetric capacity of porous $S _ { \\mathrm { i } / \\mathrm { C } ^ { - 1 2 2 } }$ is still a little higher than that of the graphite based anode,which make it useful in practical battery applications.On the other hand,it is also found that the coulombic efficiency of Si/C-12O is not very stable as the electrochemical test goes,suggesting the unstable structures during the cycling process. Compared to that, the coulombic efficiencyof Si/C-122is higherand more stable,which reaches more that $9 9 \\%$ from the 13 cycle.The detailed investigation of electrodes after cycling demonstrates that the nanopores help a lot to maintain the structure stability during electrochemical cycling,as shown in Fig S3 in Supporting information. Fig. 3b shows the corresponding voltage vs.capacity plot of Si/C-122 electrode at the 1st 3rd and 6Oth cycle.It can be clearly seen that the first charge (lithiation）anddischarge（delithiation）capacities are $1 3 9 4 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ and $9 5 7 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively. The corresponding coulombic efficiency(CE）is $6 8 . 7 \\%$ ,which is might be due to the irreversible transition from crystalline Si to amorphous $\\mathrm { L i } _ { \\mathrm { x } } \\mathrm { S i }$ ，the formation of irreversible solid electrolyte interphase(SEI） layer andlarge BET surfacearea[5].Moreover,therate capability of $\\mathsf { S i } / \\mathsf { C }$ composite can also be improved by the addition of NaCl.Fig.3c shows the rate performance of ${ \\mathrm { S i } } / { \\mathrm { C } } { - 1 2 0 }$ and $S _ { \\mathrm { i } / \\mathrm { C } ^ { - 1 2 2 } }$ at current density of $0 . 2 5 \\mathsf { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ $0 . 5 \\mathsf { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ $1 \\mathrm { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ and $2 \\mathsf { A } \\mathsf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively. After doubling the current density every ten cycles,the discharge capacitiesof ${ \\mathrm { S i } } / { \\mathrm { C } } { - 1 2 0 }$ are $8 8 9 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ， $7 2 4 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ $5 5 1 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { m A h } \\ : \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ， $3 9 2 \\mathrm { m A h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ．At the high current density of $2 \\mathsf { A } \\mathsf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,the discharge capacity is as low as $3 9 2 \\ \\mathrm { m A h } \\ \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ that is only less than half of the initial capacity at current density of $0 . 2 5 \\mathsf { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ . In contrast, the $S _ { \\mathrm { i } } / C \\mathrm { - } 1 2 2$ reveals a much better rate performance.The discharge capacities can reach $9 0 5 \\mathrm { ~ m A h ~ g ^ { - 1 } }$ $8 4 3 \\mathrm { ~ m A h ~ g ^ { - 1 } }$ ， $7 4 4 \\mathrm { m A h } \\ : \\mathbf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ and $6 1 3 \\mathrm { ~ m A h ~ g ^ { - 1 } }$ at the current density of $0 . 2 5 \\mathsf { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ $0 . 5 \\mathsf { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ $1 \\mathsf { A } \\mathsf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ and $2 \\mathsf { A } \\mathsf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,respectively. A much higher discharge capacity of $6 1 3 \\mathrm { \\ m A } \\mathrm { h } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ can be achieved at the high current density of $2 \\mathsf { A } \\mathsf { g } ^ { - 1 }$ .Moreover,the discharge capacity of Si/C-122 can be recovered to similar level when the current density is set back to $0 . 2 5 \\mathsf { A g } ^ { - 1 }$ ,compared to the obvious loss in Si/C-120.This result strongly demonstrates that the generation of nanopores by introduction of NaCl does improve the kinetics processes of lithiation/delithiation.
