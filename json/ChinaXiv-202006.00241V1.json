        "text": "Abstract: Regulation of leaf gas exchange plays an important role in the survival of trees and shrubs under future climate change. However, the responses of leaf water potential and gas exchange of shrubs in semi-arid areas to the precipitation alteration are not clear. Here,we conducted a manipulated experiment with three levels of precipitation, i.e.，a control with ambient precipitation, $50 \\%$ above ambient precipitation (irrigation treatment),and $50 \\%$ below ambient precipitation (drought treatment),with two common shrubs, Salix psammopbila C. Wang & C.Y. Yang (isohydric plant, maintaining a constant leaf water potential by stomatal regulation) and Caragana korshinski Kom. (anisohydric plant,having more variableleaf water potential),on the Chinese Loess Plateau in 2014 and 2O15.We measured the seasonal variations of predawn and midday leaf water potential ( $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { p d } }$ and $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { m d } , }$ ,two parameters of gas exchange, i.e., light-saturated assimilation $( A _ { \\mathfrak { n } } )$ and stomatal conductance $( g _ { \\mathrm { s } } )$ ，and other foliar and canopy traits. The isohydric $S _ { \\cdot }$ psammopbila hada similar $\\mathcal { A } _ { \\mathrm { n } }$ and a higher $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ than the anisohydric $C .$ korsbinskii under drought treatment in 2O15,inconsistent with the view that photosynthetic capacity of anisohydric plants is higher than isohydric plants under severe drought. The two shrubs differently responded to precipitation manipulation. $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { p d } } , \\mathcal { A } _ { \\mathrm { n } }$ and $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ were higher under irrigation treatment than control for $S$ psammopbila,and these three variables and $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { m d } }$ were significantly higher under irrigation treatment and lower under drought treatment than control for $C$ ，korsbinski. Leaf water potential and gas exchange responded to manipulated precipitation more strongly for $C .$ korsbinskii than for $S$ psammopbila.However, precipitation manipulation did not alter the sensitivity of leaf gas exchange to vapor-presure deficit and soil moisture in these two shrubs. Acclimation to long-term changes in soil moisture in these two shrubs was primarily atributed to the changes in leaf or canopy structure rather than leaf gas exchange. These findings willbe useful for modeling canopy water-carbon exchange and elucidating the adaptive strategies of these two shrubs to future changes in precipitation. ",

        "text": "Precipitation is one of the most important factors controlling primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems (Huxman et al., 2Oo4). Ecosystems in areas with the low mean annual precipitation are predicted to be most susceptible to projected changes of precipitation associated with climatic warming (de Dios et al., 2OO7). The wind-water erosion crisscross region on the Chinese Loess Plateau has the most intensive losses of soil and water in the world.Mean annual precipitation in this area is about $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ ，but mean annual evaporation is $> 1 5 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ (Tang et al., 1993)，so water scarcity is the primary factor limiting plant growth and survival in this ecosystem. Large-scale coal and oil mining have exacerbated the shortage of water resources by depleting underground water sources,and some plants already have symptoms of dieback (Fan，2007). Understanding the influences of projected variations of precipitation on the physiology， growth and productivity of local vegetation is therefore needed. ",

        "text": "Plants alleviate the threat of drought in a short term by regulating stomatal closure. Therefore, plants were classified into two drought strategies based on stomatal regulation i.e., isohydry and anisohydry (Tardieu and Simonneau, 1998). Isohydric plants maintain leaf water potential $(  { \\mathcal { H } _ { \\mathrm { l e a f } } } )$ （204号 by rapidly closing their stomata during drought, thus decreasing stomatal conductance $( g _ { \\mathrm { s } } )$ and photosynthetic assimilation. In contrast,anisohydric plants decrease $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { l e a f } }$ during drought, which may increase their vulnerability to hydraulic failure. Anisohydric plants often close their stomata later,thus maintaining higher $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ and carbon assimilation under severe drought (McDowell et al., 2008).This framework has been extensively used to explain the mortality of drought-induced trees (Adams et al., 2009; Hartmann et al.,2013; Sevanto et al., 2014). Some experimental results, however，contradict this elaborate framework. For example,daily $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ decreased more for anisohydric sunflower than for isohydric maize under severe water deficit (Tardieu and Simonneau, 1998). $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ and photosynthesis were similar at the end of a dry period for co-existing isohydric and anisohydric Mediterranean woody species (Quero et al.,2O11), the same pattern has been reported in different Vitis cultivars (Lovisolo et al.，2O1O). These results contradict the traditional view that anisohydric species can maintain higher levels of gas exchange under severe drought.Martinez-Vilalta and Garcia-Forner (2O16) found that isohydric Pinus edulis exhibited chronic embolism, whereas anisohydric Juniperus monosperma had very litle embolism, refuting the hypothesis that anisohydric species are more vulnerable than isohydric species to hydraulic failure. Garcia-Forner et al. (2O16) suggested that iso/anisohydry in the regulation of $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { l e a f } }$ may be independent of the dynamics of leaf gas exchange or the degree of hydraulic or carbon limitations under drought, necessitating the measurements of leaf water potential and gas exchange together rather than only inferring gas exchange or hydraulic traits from plant iso/anisohydric behavior.

        "text": "The long-term acclimation of plants to limited water supply is important for their growth and survival. Experimental manipulation of precipitation has provided a way to perform controlled studies of acclimation under the long-term drought, thus improving our understanding of adaptive strategies for different plants under the projected conditions of future climate change (Weltzin et al.,2003; Huang et al.,2O17). Acclimation to the long-term drought may involve the adjustment of plant morphology， physiology，anatomy，growth and/or carbon partitioning among organs. Photosynthesis is one of the most crucial physiological processes involved in acclimation (Chaves et al.,2002； Flexas et al., 2O04),and the effects of the long-term drought on photosynthetic acclimation have been studied. For example, net rate of light-saturated assimilation $( A _ { \\mathrm { n } } )$ ， $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ mesophylic conductance of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ ，maximum rate of carboxylation and maximum rate of electron transport all decreased when predawn $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { l e a f } }$ was reduced by the manipulation of throughfall in the evergreen Quercus ilex, but the functional relationships between these parameters and $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { l e a f } }$ were not affected by water treatments (Limousin et al., 2O1O). In contrast, $A _ { \\mathrm { n } }$ and $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ for $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ ilex from a mesic habitat decreased more rapidly in mesic than in dry habitats (Martin-StPaul et al.,2012). $A _ { \\mathfrak { n } }$ under full irrigation,specific leaf hydraulic conductance and $\\psi _ { \\mathrm { l e a f } }$ at zero assimilation in a mixed forest in southwestern USA decreased as precipitation decreased for both pinon and juniper trees, and leaf gas exchange acclimated to the level of precipitation in both species (Limousin et al., 2013).The long-term water stress can also invoke acclimatory responses that decrease the sensitivity of photosynthetic capacity to drought in xeric but not in riparian Eucalyptus species (Zhou et al.， 2016). These variations in acclimatory responses suggest that functional photosynthetic acclimation may be influenced by the climatic and soil conditions but can also vary among species/populations. ",

(Fabaceae) are two typical deciduous shrubs in the wind-water erosion crisscross region on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Both shrubs play important roles in controlling soil erosion and blocking the invasion of sand. S. psammophila is important to the energy and paper industries,whereas $C$ korshinskii is economically important as a highly productive forage shrub.Effects of the short-term drought on seedling water relations and photosynthesis on these two species have been studied (Liu et al.,2OO7; Xu et al., 2O12), but little is known about the responses of mature plants to the long-term drought and varied precipitation. Thus, we conducted a manipulated experiment with three levels of precipitation (a control with ambient precipitation, $50 \\%$ above ambient precipitation (irrigation treatment), and $50 \\%$ below ambient precipitation (drought treatment)） on these two shrubs to address the following three questions:（1）are $A _ { \\mathrm { n } }$ and $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ higher in $C$ korshinskii than in S. psammophila under severe drought due to the anisohydric behavior of $C$ korshinskii and isohydric behavior of S. psammophila (Li et al.，2016)? (2） does the shallow-rooted S. psammophila respond more strongly than $C$ .korshinskii to the higher precipitation，and is it severely inhibited under drought treatment? and (3） xeric species photosynthetically acclimate to the long-term drought better than riparian species (Martin-StPaul et al.,2012; Zhou et al.,2016),so does the drought-resistant C. korshinski (Ma et al.,2008; Xu et al.,2012) photosynthetically acclimate better than the drought-vulnerable S. psammophila?

The high infiltration capacity of the sandy soils at the sites may also have allowed rainwater to quickly infiltrate to deep soil, which would be difficult to access by the shallow-rooted S. psammophila. Our previous data for the growth of these two shrubs (Ai et al., 2Ol7） also demonstrated that seasonal increase in aboveground biomass was larger for $C$ .korshinskii than for S. psammophila under irrigation treatment but smaller under drought treatment, supporting the validity of our data for gas exchange.
