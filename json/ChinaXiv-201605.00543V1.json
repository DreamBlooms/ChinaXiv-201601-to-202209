The term biofuels is hard to explain,as we used biofuel as like fossil fuel. However,biofuel has a unique correspondence from other energy sources，asit considered being carbon dioxide emissions neutral (AENews, 2014).There are different counter arguments poses the biofuels production. One argued in the favor of biofuelsproduction that addresses the greenhouse gas emissions and removes carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere.However， the second stream of argument against the biofuels production poses a major threat to global food security and for biodiversity (Christopherson，2008)．According to UNCTAD (2008, P.vii)，'There is growing interest in biofuels in many developing countries asa means of'modernizing'biomass use and providing greateraccess to clean liquid fuels while helping to address energy costs,energy security and global warming concerns associated with petroleum fuels'.There is undeniable fact that fossil fuel is one of the main concerns in the circle of environmentalists and academicians toward environmental degradation. The quest for the alternative energy sources always is the need of the globe to sustain and formulates green policies. The biofuels somehow a convenient solution to preserve environment and substitute of high petroleum; however，biofuel energy should be evaluated with some cautions，as it is so far highly environmental friendly energy sources across the globe (Chauhan & Shukla,2011).Biodiesel fuel is the only option to serve healthy nation and fulfill the requirements of Clean Air Act of 1990,as the particulate emissions associated with the biodiesel fuels is lowering around more than $5 0 \\%$ with fossil source diesel.

This notion is used by many developed countries and found that biomass fuel is environmental friendly However,the systems need to be caution in terms of environment and social benefits across the countries. Schaldach et al. (2011) examining the potential impact of biofuel development on land-use change in India and found that rising population and biofuel production will affect on the land-use change over the coming decades in India.Ravindranath et al. (2011） further step toward the sustainability of India in relation with the biofuel development and its impact on three key environmental factors comprising land use,environment, and food production. The results suggest that technological and policy breakthroughs are prerequisite for promoting sustainable and long-term biofuel production in India. According to Groom et al.(2008,p. 602)‘Conservation biologists can significantly broaden and deepen effrts to develop sustainable fuels by playing active roles in pursuing research on biodiversity-friendly biofuel production practicesandby helping definebiodioersity-friendly biofuel certification standards'.

(2010) traces the footprints of greenhouse gas during different biofuel production systems and found that greenhouse gas performance of biofuels varies depends upon the production method applications and the selected system boundaries. Common practice in life cycle assessment (LCA) of bioenergy has been to assume that any carbon dioxide $\\left( \\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } \\right)$ emission related to biomass combustion equals the amount absorbed in biomass, thus assuming no climate change impacts (Cherubini et al.,2011;Van Zelm et al.,2014). Demirbas (2Oo7) conclude that the main advantage of biofuels production is to minimize the risk of greenhouse gas emissions and unpredictable climate change across the globe.According to Hill et al.

There is one thing be in a mind that if the economies pertaining to the bioenergy development in a region, there should be keen focused on the land-use changes and greenhouse gas balances for climatic protections.Piccirillo (2012）conclude that biofuel energy is one of the key factors of green development alternative to the standard fossil fuels,as it is produced from renewable energy sources. Besides that the impact of biofuel energy on environmental degradation is observed smaller as compared to the conventional fossil fuel combustion，because the plants used for biofuel production absorb carbon dioxide emissions, that leading to zero net $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions.

The time series data of 17 developed and developing countries taken from U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA）database for the period of 2000-2012. The study employed number of panel econometric modeling techniques on merit, that is,panel unit root test evaluate stationary series of the variables; panel co-integration test indicates the longrun connection between the variables,panel GMM technique incorporated the endogeneity problem from the model; and robust least square regression technique addresses the outliers in the given model.

The panel co-integration results rejected the null hypothesis of no co-integration against the alternative hypothesis.Therefore，the study established that there is co-integration relationship between thevariables.Theresultsof GMMindicate thatboth the carbon dioxide emissions and renewable electricity generation have a positive and significant association with the biofuels production in the region. The results of robust least square regression confirmed that all of the sustainable indicators have a dynamic linkage with the biofuels production.Thus，the policy related to the green biofuels production process should be carried out for long-term development in the region.

        "text": "On the basis of the following results,the study pro posed short-term,medium term and long-term policy implications.In the short-term，the policymakers and government officials may have to reduce the burden of trade deficit using the diverse energy mix in their portfolios.However,biofuel energy has a distinct edge on the other energy mix as it may be used as a substitute for high priced petroleum. In addition, biofuels energy using in transport sector may help to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions to addresses the threat of climate change in the region. In the medium-term plan, policymakers should have to be devoted a major expenditures on the $\\textsc { r } \\& \\textmu$ activitiesrelated with the sustainable development of biofuels including the availability of the biofuels,cost effectiveness,ecosystem protection, etc.Finally，in the long-term plan，the policymakers have to promote biofuels as the important component that reduces life cycle $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions by replacing fossil fuels.However,it is point of noted that during cultivation and production of biofuels,second-generation bio fuels produces less carbon dioxide emissions than the replaced fossil fuel. Biofuels development should be considered as integrated spatial planning with resource efficiency and renewable energy strategies. Therefore, biofuels production is the desirable situation to optimize economic growth that lead to sustainable development across the globe.Future research should focus on different income level country group,longer data series and with more variables to investigate this issue.
