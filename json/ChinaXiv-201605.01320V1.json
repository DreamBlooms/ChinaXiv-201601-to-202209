        "text": "Curcumin,a hydrophobic polyphenol derived from the rhizome of the herb Curcuma longa,has shown health promoting and disease preventingactivity against several diseases including cancer [1].However, several studies have revealed extremely low water-solubility,unstable property,rapid metabolism and poor absorption of this molecule that severely reduces its bioavailability[2,3].To overcome these problems,drug delivery systems (DDS) have been taken into consideration to provide longer circulation times,increased permeability,and resistance toward metabolic presystemic degradation [4,5].It is well known that the main problem of cancer therapy is how to deliver anticancer drug to tumor organ or tissue to improve its therapeutic efficiency and decrease its side-effect.Active target technology has been intensively researched for solving it with significant development [6-10].In this area,some small molecular target compounds,such as folic acid [11],galactose [12],arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (Arg-Gly-Asp,RGD）[13] and forth,have been used to decorate polymeric particle for enhancing curcumin's active targeting property.It is noted that biotin is used widely as a tumor targeting ligand for various anti-cancer drugs [14-2O]. Overexpression of itsreceptor on the surface of different cancer cells can introduce the biotin-conjugated copolymeric drug delivery system into them [20].In our previous research,a Y-shaped methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly (epsilon-caprolactone) $\\begin{array} { r l } {  { \\bigl ( \\mathrm { M P E G - P C L } _ { 2 } . } } \\end{array}$ ）blockcopolymer can provide a higher encapsulation efficiency for curcumin with sustained release property [21]. So,it is believed that drug delivery system based on Y-shaped biotin-conjugated poly (ethylene glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (biotin-PEG- $\\mathrm { . P C L } _ { 2 }$ copolymeric micelles cannot onlyafford better encapsulationand release property for curcumin,butalso realize selective delivery of it to cancer cells. ",

        "text": "However,the cancer cell selective uptake of curcumin-loaded biotin-PEG- $\\mathrm { . P C L } _ { 2 }$ micelles was obviously enhanced,surpassing curcumin's release via the induction of biotin when the concentration of curcumin achieved $4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ .Although the release rate of curcumin from biotin-PEG- $\\cdot \\mathsf { P C L } _ { 2 }$ micelles was always slower than that from $_ { \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { N } - \\mathrm { P E G } - \\mathrm { P C L } _ { 2 } }$ micelles,uptake of the former was much higher than the latter.This change induced by biotin greatly enhanced curcumin's concentration in MDA-MB-436 cells,and the release amount of curcumin from micelles without biotin only mildly enhanced at the same time.Asa result,amounts of curcuminreleased in MDA-MB-436 cells from the two drug-loaded micelles were analogous in $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ when the curcumin's concentration was set at $4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ ，showing similar cytotoxicities against MDA-MB-436 cells.When the incubation time was extended to $4 8 \\mathrm { h }$ ，more and more curcumin in the biotin $\\mathsf { P E G \\mathrm { - P C L } } _ { 2 }$ micelles werereleased into cancercells,resulting in higher cytotoxic effect than that of the latter.In conclusion, the biotin molecular could improve the cancer cell uptake of drug-loaded micelles,showing better property of cancer cells target at higher dosage of drug for a longincubation time.
