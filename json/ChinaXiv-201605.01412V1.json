Conversely,PDI catalyzes disulfide reduction in a substrate by transferring reducing equivalents to the oxidized substrate.The disulfide isomerization process could be achieved by two modes:the N-terminal cysteine in the active site of PDl attacks the mispaired disulfide in substrate and then directly shuffles the intramolecular disulfide rearrangement;alternatively，repeated cycles of substrate reduction followed by reoxidation are completed by mixed reduced/oxidized PDl [17]. PDI was recognized only as an oxidoreductase and excluded as a chaperone [18] ora general chaperone[19] at the beginning of the 1990 s.However,chaperone is a functional rather than a structural concept,and PDI was deduced to meet the main requirements of being a chaperone for the followings:（1) the spontaneous folding and formation of disulfide bonds within a polypeptide in vitro are often slow processes,and PDI-promoted oxidative folding with elevated efficiency does not need the presence of recognized chaperones;(2） PDI exists in the ER at high concentrations [13], and thus can function at stoichiometric levels as a chaperone; (3）PDI is notable in its capacity of nonspecific peptide binding through hydrophobic interaction[20,21],a prominent feature for a chaperone.

For oxidative protein folding,the chemical formation or disruption of disulfide bonds is accompanied by the processes of “conformational folding”of the polypeptide chain.These processes are connected intimatelyand affected interdependently. Therefore,to explore the chaperone activity of PDI explicitly distinct from its known enzyme activity,proteins without disulfide,such as glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [24] and rhodanese [25], were selected as target proteins.The presence of PDI in the folding system at stoichiometric instead of catalytic amounts indeed greatly increased the reactivation yield oftheguanidine hydrochloride-denatured GAPDH or rhodanese on dilution and suppressed their aggregation during refolding，without being a part of the final functional structure.In addition,PDl suppressed aggregation of rhodanese during thermal denaturation.These properties are entirely consistent with the definition of chaperones by Ellis [18]and fully meet the four criteria proposed by Jakob and Buchner [26] for characterization of a protein as a molecular chaperone.As the reactivation of those target proteins has nothing to do with the formation of disulfides,the folding promoting effects of PDl cannot be attributed to its enzyme activity but only to its intrinsic chaperone activity.

Catalytic amounts of PDI only catalyzed very limited reactivation,and alkylated PDI alone,evenat stoichiometric amounts,showed no effect on the reactivation of acidic phospholipase A2.These experiments unambiguously discriminated the chaperone and oxidoreductase activities of PDI in the oxidative folding of disulfide-containing protein,and demonstrated that both of the two activities are necessary for PDl to function as an efficient folding catalyst [31].A similar strategyusing enzymatically inactive PDI has been employed to examine the chaperone activity of PDI in other reactions;e.g.,PDI with its active site mutated showed an ability to increase the expression of active lysozyme in E.coli [32].

And PDl enhances tissue factor coagulant activity on microvesicles through its chaperone activity rather than its oxidoreductase activity [46].The above examples all indicate the chaperone function of PDI in diverse physiological events.

The displacement of the A1 subunit from the other parts of the toxin relies on the chaperone activity but not oxidoreductase activity of PDI [47,49]. In the sequential calnexin/BiP/PDI system for preparing substrates in ERAD,the chaperone activity of PDI is also redox dependent [43].However,the concept that PDl is a redoxdependent chaperone was challenged by arguing that the redoxdependent dissociation of PDl from its substrate is mediated by glutathione disulfide competition [5O]. Until recently, the details of the redox-driven conformational change of PDl have been depicted by various structural techniques (see part III). Oxidation of PDI results in the conversion from the compact conformation to the open conformation with the substrate-binding surface more exposed，exhibiting higher chaperone activity to prevent the aggregation during substrate refolding [51].In oxidative protein folding,PDI in the oxidized state with open conformation recognizes and binds to unfolded peptides/proteins,transfers its disulfide to them，and PDI itself becomes reduced in closed conformation,which releases folded substrates.Should nonnative disulfides be inserted into substrates,reduced PDI can bind to these folding intermediates and catalyze the disulfide isomerization and afterward release the folded substrates [52].

Later,a small angle X-ray scattering(SAXS) study presented a structural shape of human PDI in a short and roughly elliptical cylinder with an annular arrangement of its four Trx-like domains [54].The trials to obtain the fulllength PDl structure were unsuccessful for a long time,although the single domain structures a [55],b [56],and a'[57] were determined in the late 199O s of the last century.A breakthrough in this field came along with the determination of the crystal structure of yeast Pdi1p.Yeast Pdi1p shows an overall U-shaped organization of the four Trx-like domains,in which the a and $ { \\mathbf { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ domains represent two flexible arms connected to the rigid bb' base[58].After that, the structures of different domain combinations of human PDI including b'x [59],bb'[6O],and bb'xa'[51],as well as the full-length structures of other human PDl family members ERp44 [61],ERp29 [62],ERp57[63],ERp27[64],and ERp46 [65],subsequently came to the fore.Part of this progress has recently been reviewed by Gehring and co-workers [66], Ruddock and co-workers [6],and Freedman and co-workers [67], andafurther related review is given by Kenji Inaba in this special issue.Hereinafter,we will focus on the interdomain interactions and dynamics in full-length PDl,based on the crystal structures of human PDl in the reduced and oxidized states,which is the first report of the structures of mammalian PDl containing all the four Trx-like domains [68].

Only the catalytic domains of PDIs are shown for simplicity. Once the folding load of reduced substrates (such as nascent polypeptides) increases,the redox homeostasis in the ER is disturbed,and more reduced PDIs are generated, which quickly reduce the regulatory disulfides in Erolα and liberate the outer active site located in the loop region (red arrow1).The activated Erolα specifically recognizes the $\\mathbf { b } ^ { \\prime } \\mathbf { x } \\mathbf { a } ^ { \\prime }$ domains of PDI and preferentially oxidizes the active site in the a' domain,which further introduces disulfides into reduced substrates (purple arrow 1).

The $ { \\mathbf { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ domain of PDI contributes to disulfide introduction while the a domain mainly to disulfide isomerization,so as to guarantee the effciency and fidelity of oxidative protein folding.Quite differently,the two active sites of Pdi1p can both be readily oxidized by Ero1p [94],with the oxidation rate of domain a somewhat faster [95]. Consequently, the yeast Ero1p/Pdi1p system is less effcient than the human system in the proofreading of nonnative disulfides as assessed in vitro [94].These data are in agreement with the observations that Pdi1p in yeast exists predominantly in the oxidized state [96],and less than $6 \\%$ of its isomerase activity is needed for yeast growth [97]. On the contrary, in human cells a majority of PDl active sites are in the reduced state [98]. It is rational that the Ero1α/PDI system in mammals has evolved to adapt to the folding of disulfide-rich secretory and membrane proteins,especially those containing nonconsecutive disulfide bonds, which are not ample in lower eukaryotes.

PDl functions not only as the substrate of Ero1, but also as a crucial regulator of Ero1 activity [94,101,102]. If the environment of the ERis relatively reducing,the oxidase activity of Ero1 can be activated due to the reduction of the regulatory bonds byreduced PDI,and generates disulfides in PDI and in substrates to recover the redox state of the ER accompanied by peroxide production.Once the ER becomes too oxidizing,the regulatory bonds of Ero1 are reformed,either byautonomous reoxidation or byoxidized PDI,and Ero1 is inactivated to avoid futile oxidation cycles with excess peroxide production.The tight regulation of Ero1α by PDl could bea critical determinant of ER redox homeostasis [1O3]. In contrast, the regulation of $\\mathtt { E r o 1 \\beta }$ is looser,underlining its role as a more active oxidase in professional secretory cells where massive oxidative power is required [92]. ",

Inactive Ero1α showed a lower affinity for PDI in vitro [1O5],and no stable binding with PDI in cells was detected [94].A protruding $\\beta$ -hairpin in Ero1α, which contains an exposed tryptophan residue,was reported to be critical for the bindingand functional disulfide relay with PDl [106]. Intriguingly,in the solved crystal structures of active and inactive Ero1α no significant conformational difference was found,including the protruding $\\beta \\cdot$ -hairpin [1o5].Additional structural elementsin active Ero1α could be speculated to recognize PDI for efficient disulfide relay. The hydrophobic binding between the Ero1α and the PDI b'xa' fragment provides the structural basis for the preference of Ero1α to oxidize the active site next to the C-terminus of the substrate-binding domain ${ \\bf \\delta b } ^ { \\prime }$ [91].In line with this model, several PDI family proteins with their catalytic domains containing the -CGHCactive sites but lacking the unique $ { \\mathbf { b } } ^ { \\prime }$ domain in PDI can also regulate Ero1α activity [94,104],but are poor substrates of Ero1α [94,107].

Therefore, the redox-based PDIEro1 feedback regulation loop could participate in controlling the strength of UPR signaling in the ER,which could make cell life and death decisions [129].Remarkably,the roles of PDI and its family members have been unraveled in diverse physiologyand pathophysiology,such as hemostasis,infectious disease,cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,and infertility (for review,see Refs. [14,15,13O]).More and more studies are focusing on PDI as targets fordisease diagnosis and therapy. On the one hand,development of small-molecule PDI inhibitors is promising for cancer therapy, as cancer cells with a global increase in protein synthesis are more vulnerable to PDI inhibition than normal cells [131].PDI inhibitors can also be useful to block the internalization of pathogens,such as HIV[132]. On the other hand,many neurodegenerative diseases are linked to the abnormal posttranslational modification of PDI with compromised enzyme and/or chaperone activity[13o].Thus, drugs that boost PDl activity and gene therapy approaches for \"gain of function\"may be useful strategies for the intervention of these diseases.Our understanding of PDI biology will no doubt be greatly improved by future advances,e.g.，the development of high-throughput assays for specific PDl activity,the discovery of more efficient and specific PDI inhibitorsand/oractivators,and the acquisition of high-resolution structures of PDl in different clientbound states.
