To further improve the accuracy and performance of HY-2A observed SSHs, several new treatments including 4 parameters maximum likelihood estimation (MLE4） retracking for Ku and C band,nonparameter sea state bias(NPSSB) model,and reprocessed dual-frequency altimeter ionospheric correction are included The evaluation from dual-crossover comparison of the fully reprocessed level-2 sensor geophysical dataset records (SGDRs） data suggests that the algorithm and model improvements mentioned above give rise to remarkable promotion to the accuracy of the forthcoming version GDRs In this study we conclude that the standard deviation of5.79 cm is achieved from crossover comparison between HY-2A and Jason-2 sea surface height (SSHs)， suggestinga promising situation ofHY-2A altimetry datasets.
