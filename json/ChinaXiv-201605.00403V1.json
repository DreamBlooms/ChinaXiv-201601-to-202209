Here we show that genetic manipulation of zeatin-Oglucosylation regulates the formation of important agronomic traits in rice by manipulating the expression of OscZOG1 gene, encodinga putative zeatin O-glucosyltransferase.We found that OscZOG1 was preferentially expressed in shoot and root meristematic tissues and nascent organs.The growth of lateral roots was stimulated in the overexpression lines,but inhibited in RNA interference lines.In shoots,knockdown of OscZOG1 expression by RNA interference significantly improved tillering,panicle branching,grain number per panicle and seed size,which are important agronomic traits for grain yield.In contrast,constitutive expression of OscZOG1 leads to negative effects on the formation of the grain-yielding traits witha marked increase in theaccumulation levels of cis-zeatin O-glucoside (cZOG) in the transgenic rice plants.In this study, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of improving the critical yield-determinant agronomic traits，including tiller number,panicle branches,total grain number per panicle and grainweight by downregulating the expression level of OscZOG1. Our results suggest that modulating the levels of cytokinin glucosylation can function as a fine-tuning switch in regulating the formation of agronomic traits in rice. ",

Strong hybridization signals were found throughout the primary root tip,including the root meristematic region and the signal intensity began to dramatically decrease over the tip region (Figure 1C). It is well known that lateral root initiation begins with the activation of cell proliferation in pericycle cells，which produces a lateral root primordium (Laskowski et al.1995).Next，OscZOG1 expression was examined during the initiation of lateral roots. Strong signals were observed in primordia,which formed a new meristem during the initiation of lateral roots in rice (Figure 1B,D).Almost no expression was detected in the epidermis and internal layers of the root.These results indicate that OscZOG1 is activated preferentially in dividing regions in roots.

Importantly，downregulation of OscZOG1 expression by RNA interference can generate the rice transgenic plants in which important agronomic traits for grain yield were significantly improved,including increase in panicle branching,grain number per panicle and seed size. In general, the transgenic rice lines overexpressing OscZOG1 led to reduction in panicle size and the number of branches, especially for secondary branches (Figure 8A-D). By contrast, the RNAi-OscZOG1 transformants had longer panicles with more branches relative to the wild-type plants (Figure 8A-D). Considering that OscZOG1 is highly expressed in reproductive meristematic tissues (Figure 4),the genetic modulation of OscZOG1 expression also determines the number of grains per panicle that is an important yield trait in rice.The number of grains per panicle dramatically increased to 172-186 on average per panicle in three RNAi transgenic lines with respect to 156 per panicle in the wild-type panicles,whereas three overexpression lines showed a significant reduction in the number of grains per panicle (121-138 per panicle on average) (Figure 8E).TheRNAi-OscZOG1 transformants had more spikelets per panicle，which is attributable to more primary and secondary branches generated in the transformants relative to the wild-type plants.More importantly,downregulating the expression level of OscZOG1 led to a significant increase in 1ooo-grain weight ranged from 28.2 to $_ { 2 9 . 5 8 }$ in three RNAi-transgenic lines with respect to $2 7 . 6 \\mathrm { g }$ in the wild-type grains (Figure 9A，B). By contrast, overexpressing OscZOG1 negatively modulated grain development (Figure 9A，B).These results of phenotypic analysis indicate that cytokinin glucosylation through genetic modulation of $\\scriptstyle { O s c Z O G 1 }$ represents a fine-tuning of regulating the formation of important agronomic traits，especially for the yield contributing factors such as tiller number, panicle branches,total spikelet number per panicle and grain weight.

In order to test the impact of modulating the expression of OscZOG1 on the accumulation of O-glucosylzeatin,cytokinins were purified from shoots of the young transgenic rice plants and quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).As shown in Figure 1oA-D,O-glucosides of cis-zeatin (cZOG) were found to be increased significantly in shoots of the OscZOG1-overexpression transgenic rice line (OE-3) while no significant differences were found in the levels of transzeatin O-glucosides (tZOG) between wild-type and the overexpression transgenic line OE- $^ { 3 }$ (Figure S4A). In contrast, the amounts of cZOG were lower in shoots of the OscZOG1- RNAi transgenic line (Ri-1) than that in the wild-type shoots (Figure 1oA).The levels of trans-zeatin and cis-zeatin were varied slightly among wild-type,the OscZOG1- RNAi transgenic line and OscZOG1-overexpression transgenic line (Figure S4B and C)，which is consistent with the findings reported in UGT85A1 overexpression transgenic lines in Arabidopsis (Jin et al. 2013).

Several lines of evidence suggest that reduction of the cytokinin status abbreviates the activity of the SAM,indicating that cytokinin isa positive regulator of SAMactivity (Werner et al. 2001; Nishimura et al. 2oo4; Werner and Schmuelling 2009). It is known that zeatin is an essential cytokinin in higher plants due to its ubiquitous nature and high activity. Zeatin and its derivatives are the most important group of isoprenoid cytokinins. Among isoprenoid cytokinins， trans-zeatinis considered to play a central role in plant growth and development due to its extremely high activity in most bioassays (Mok and Mok 2oo1).Other free bases with cytokinin activity， cis-zeatin， dihydrozeatin，and $N ^ { 6 } - ( \\triangle ^ { 2 } -$ isopentenyl) adenine (iP),are also present in most plant tissues (Mok and Mok 2001; Sakakibara 20o6). Interestingly, evidence from recent studies suggests that cis-zeatin may act as an active cytokinin in maize (Martin et al.2oo1b; Veach et al. 2003) and rice (Kudo et al.2o12). It has been recognized that the relative stability in the levels of other cytokinins is necessary for maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in plant tissues since small decreases in zeatin concentrations could trigger zeatin biosynthesis in organs and tissues capable of cytokinin biosynthesis,such as root tips and shoot meristems (Mok and Mok 2oo1; Sakakibara 2oo6; Muller and Sheen 2008; Werner and Schmuelling 2oo9; Perilli et al. 201o). With regards to the role of OscZOG1 in improving crop production,it is worth noting that the major contributions of downregulating OscZOG1 expression lie in promoting meristematic activity in both vegetative and reproductive developmental stages without undesirable phenotypes such as abnormal leaf, flower or grain morphology. Considering that OscZOG1 is highly expressed in reproductive meristem tissues，genetic manipulation of cytokinin conjugation status,which has been achieved by up- or downregulating the expression level of OscZOG1,can moderately promote or inhibit the activity of the inflorescence meristem.In maize transgenic plants,increased zeatin conjugation caused by constitutively expressing ZOG1, encoding a zeatin O-glucosyltransferase from Phaseolus lunatus L., leads to a pronounced reduction in tassel size, branching,and spikelet production (Rodo et al.2oo8). Similar results were described in the previous studies that genetic manipulation of cytokinin glycosylation by overexpressing ZOG genes can significantly alter the phenotypes of transformants in tobacco (Martin etal.2oo1a) and rice (Kudo et al. 2012).In contrast, the reduced expression of OsCKX2 causes cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of reproductive organs,resulting in enhanced grain yield (Ashikari et al.2oo5). Our findings are consistent with previous reports and further confirm that suitable architecture of crop plants for high grain yield can be achieved by genetic manipulation of the bioactive cytokinin level.In recent reports,it has been increasingly recognized that catabolism of plant hormones plays significant roles in plant growth and development (Zhang et al. 2o13; Koo et al. 2014;Kramer and Ackelsberg 2015).

In this study,we provide several lines of evidence supporting that OscZOG1 is a critical player in maintaining the activities of SAM and RAM in rice.Firstly,in situ hybridization data suggest that OscZOG1 expression is highly targeted to cells in rapidly growing regions,including shoot and root meristematic tissues. Secondly，genetic modulation of the OscZOG1 expression can act as a finetuning of regulating the shoot development,especially for the yieldcontributing factors such as tiller number，panicle branches and total spikelet number per panicle.Thirdly,in accordance with the role of cytokinin in regulating lateral root organogenesis (Laplaze et al. 2oo7; Hwang et al. 2012),our results indicate that modulating the expression levels of OscZOG1 evidently affects the initiation and growth of lateral roots in rice.As one of the central endogenous signaling molecules,the plant hormone cytokinins tightly control the dividing activities of founder cells during the early phases of lateral root organogenesis (Laplaze et al. 2oo7). Our findings reveal a critical role of OscZOG1 in modulating the cytokinin response,which ensures continuous lateral root initiation (LRl) and proper development of lateral root primordia (LRP). ",

The genetic modulation of OscZOG1 expression reported here exploits the conjugation properties of cis-zeatin to regulate the bioactive levels of cytokinins critical for the activity of shoot and inflorescence meristems,indicating that OscZOG1-mediated glucosylation of cis-zeatin has a regulatory function.More importantly，Oglucosylzeatin is found in all plant species examined (Mok et al.2000a，200ob; Mok and Mok 2001; Bajguz and Piotrowska 2oo9).Thus，our findings have provided the opportunity for fully characterizing the role of OscZOG1 as a critical component in balancing cytokinin homeostais during the formation of yield-contributing traits and as points for the artificial manipulation of cytokinin-mediated growth control. Since it has long been recognized that grain development is related to elevated zeatin in cereals (Cheikh and Jones 1994; Dietrich et al. 1995; Ashikari et al. 2005; Wilkinson et al. 2012), the dissection of molecular mechanisms of cytokinin-glucosylation that contributesto the formationof rice yield traits is important fordeveloping high-yielding rice varieties.Our data also inform the potential advantage of modulating OscZOG1 expression as a fine-tuning switch to improve multiple favorable agronomic traits in one genetic background,which could circumvent some of the pitfalls so far encountered in breeding for increases in the complex traits of yield.
