As to coordinate system of the bed, the $z$ direction is parallel to the axis of the bed,with the $x$ and $y$ directions determined by right-hand screw rule.For the bed with $D / d _ { \\mathrm { p } } { = } 5 . 6$ ,local void fraction of DEM simulation were compared with MRI data of Sederman et al.[12] and predicted values of correlations of Klerk[13] and Mueller[14],as shown in Fig.2.It can be seen that the distribution of void fraction along the radial direction of the bed from simulation are,asa whole, in agreement with MRI data and predicted values of correlations,though there are a little discrepancies between simulation and data/correlation,especially at the maxima and minima.Local void fraction of the simulation is slightly greater than experimental data because the simulated bed is loose packing compared with the experimental packing.Even so,the packing structure built using DEM could reflect the real situation of packed beds, considering the deviation of experiment and simulation and the change of real height of packed particles in the radial direction of the bed.
