The addition of either $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ or mixed $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } / S O } _ { 4 } \\mathrm { { } } ^ { 2 - }$ salt obviously increased soil EC,but adversely affected soil biological activities including soil invertase activity， soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC)and substrate-induced respiration (SIR). $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ salt showed a greater deleterious influence than mixed $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } / S O _ { 4 } } { ^ { 2 - } }$ （204号 salt on soil enzymes and MBC, e.g., the higher soil MBC consistently appeared with $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } / S O } _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ instead of $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ treated soil. Meanwhile,we found that SIR was more reliable than soil basal respiration (SBR) on explaining the changes of soil biological activity responsive to salt disturbance. In addition, microbial community structures of the soil bacteria,fungi,and Bacillus were obviously afected by both salt types and soil EC levels,and its diversity increased with increasing of mixed $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } / S O } _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ salt rates,and then sharply declined down after it reached critical point. Moreover, the diversity of fungal community was more sensitive to the mixed salt addition than other groups.The response of soil physiological profiles (Biolog) followed a dose-response pattern with $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ $( \\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 8 3 )$ or mixed $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } } / \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ $\\mathrm { ( R ^ { 2 } { = } 0 . 8 9 ) }$ salt.

Following this,Wakelin et al. (2O12） and Morrissey et al. (2014) found the obvious shifts in bacterial abundance and community composition along with soil EC gradients. However, different types and levels of soil salt exhibit different impacts on soil biological property and function. For example,soil nitrification rate is increasingly inhibited by the increase of soil EC (Inubushi et al.,1999). Rath et al. (2016) showed that microbial respiration was more strongly affected by $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ than by $S O _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ containing salts. Nevertheless,controversial results often exist in literature about the relative impact of salt type and concentration on soil biological property (Rath and Rousk，2O15； Rath et al.， 2O16). Considering the increasing concerns of the soil salinization problem，further understanding the impacts of salt on soil biological process is urgently needed. ",

The physiological profiles (C-utilization plates; Biolog Inc.,Hayward, CA, USA) were analyzed after $1 2 0 \\mathrm { h }$ incubation. This time point was chosen because it allows suitable time for color development in the wells with high salinity, while the color development for the control samples was still linearly increasing over time.The responses of the variables were normalized and the similarity in C-use among samples was compared using the Euclidean distance method. We tested the effects of salt type 0 $\\mathrm { \\underline { { C l ^ { - } } } }$ and mixed $\\mathrm { \\bar { C l } ^ { - } } / \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - } ,$ ）and salt-induced changes in soil EC using permutation-based multivariate analysis of variation (PERMANOVA; Anderson, 2O01), with salt type as the main test,and EC as a covariate. For the bacterial and fungal community analysis,PCR-DGGE band intensity data were $4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ -root transformed (down-weighting over abundant species） and similarities in community compositions among the samples were calculated using the Bray-Curtis algorithm. The inverse Simpson index( $1 - \\lambda$ ，soil diversity） was calculated with non-transformed DGGE band data (Primer 6). Multivariate statistical testing then followed the PERMANOVA approach (as above). Segmental dose-response logistic regressions were fitted to model the effects of salt treated gradient on AWCD( $( 1 2 0 \\ \\mathrm { h } )$ . And we calculated the IC5O values (concentration of a contaminant that inhibits $50 \\%$ of a specific biological process, referred as threshold) using the least-squares method (GraphPad Prism version 5, GraphPad Software, San Diego; Haanstra et al, 1985). Based on 16S-rDNA and ITS-rDNA gene PCR-DGGE banding profiles, we calculated the relationship between soil diversity and salt treated gradient using segmental linear regression and the fit of the data compared with single linear regression alone. The intercepts of segmental regressions were used to determine threshold effects of increasing salt on soil microbial community diversity. ",

Our findings are in agreement with the report by Rietz and Haynes (2OO3） who discovered the enzymatic activities of catalase, invertase, and $\\beta$ -glucosidase decreased with soil EC increasing. Similarly，Ghollarata and Raiesi (2OO7） reported soil $\\beta$ -glucosidase， invertase，and urease activities were largely inhibited by soil salt. Following this, Yan and Marschner (2O12) confirmed soil microbial activities including cumulative respiration and MBC were negatively affected by salinity. The most likely reasons why soil enzymatic activity decreased when exposed to salt ambient were as follows: (1) high salt concentration can result in a low availability of water due to decreasing soil osmotic and matric potential, as a consequence,resulting in the dehydration of soil microbes (Rath and Rousk, 2O15).For example, Saviozzi et al. (2O11) reported the decrease of soil enzyme activity was highly associated with the decrease of soil osmotic potential caused by salt;(2） soil salt denatured enzymatic proteins and accelerated soil enzymes proteolysis (Caprioti et al., 2O14); and (3) soil aggregate was dispersed and soil structure was destroyed by salt ion,resulting in the deterioration of living inhabits for the soil microorganisms (Saviozzi et al., 2011).
