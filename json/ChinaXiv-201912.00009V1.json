        "text": "Abstract: Seed germination is a key transitional stage in plant life cycle and is strongly regulated by temperature and light. Therefore,research on the effects of temperature and light on seed germination is extremely meaningful for vegetation restoration, especially in desert ecosystems. Seeds of 28 ephemeral plants collcted from the Gurbantunggut Desert of China were incubated at different temperatures （204号 $( 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ $1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 1 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ in 12-h light/12-h darkness or continuous darkness regimes, and the responses of seed germination to temperature and light and the germination speed were studied in 2O16. Results showed that seed germination percentage of the 28 ephemeral plants significantly differed to temperature and light. We clasified the studied plants as the following groups based on their responses to temperature: 1 low temperature responsed plants, 12 moderate temperature responsed plants,7 high temperature responsed plants, 4 non-responsed plants and 5 plants of no germination. It should be noted that Corispermum lehmannianum Bunge is sensitive to both moderate and high temperatures. There were 4 groups of plant in response to light,i.e.,7 light responsed plants,10 dark responsed plants, 6 light non-responsed plants and 5 plants of no germination. Based on seed germination speed of the 28 ephemeral plants,we divided them into 4 paterns of germination,i.e., very rapid, moderately rapid, moderate and slow. Combining variations of temperature, precipitation and sand dune types in the study area, we suggested that very rapid and moderately rapid germinated plants could be used to moving sand dunes in early spring during vegetation restoration, moderate germinated plants could be used to semi-fixed sand dunes in late autumn,and slow germinated plants could be used to sand plain in summer. Thus,seedling establishment and vegetation restoration would be improved by considering seed germination characteristics of these ephemeral plants in the Gurbantunggut Desert, China. ",

        "text": "Since the 199Os,land reclamation and livestock grazing have been widely conducted in arid and semi-arid lands of China (Stumpp et al.,2005; Tang et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2018), thus causing vegetation destruction and desertification (Zheng et al.,2OO3; Wang et al.,2O04; Yan et al.,2016). Hence,it is essential to take measures to recover the damaged land in these areas. In the process of vegetation restoration， seed germination is a key to success and is often affected by environmental factors，such as soil moisture, temperature,light, etc.Particularly temperature often changes the activity of enzyme in seed, which causes seed coat to rupture and changes the permeability of water permeability,ultimately afecting seed germination (Tabatabaei, 2015). Simultaneously, light can also act as a stimulus signal to release seed dormancy, thereby inducing seed germination (Barrero et al.,2O12). Therefore, it is especially important to study the effects of temperature and light on seed germination. ",

Within a certain temperature range, seed germination percentage has a linear relationship with temperature (Phartyal et al., 2OO9) and the highest germination percentage is found within a certain temperature range (Chanyenga et al.,2Ol2; Zhou et al.,2O12). Moreover, temperatures above or below the optimal temperature are not beneficial to seed germination (Gao et al.,2OO7). Therefore,seed germination may occur between the minimum and maximum threshold temperatures and the highest germination percentage corresponds to the optimal temperature (Durr et al.，2O15).Therefore，research on the effect of temperature on seed germination is essential to determine the appropriate time for sowing during vegetation restoration process (Baskin and Baskin,1998; Durr et al., 2015).

Some species can germinate in light or darkness,but the other species only germinate in continuous darkness (Wang et al.,2005; Liu et al.,2O1O). In the field, when seeds mature,they fall from the maternal plants onto the soil surface and are inevitably buried into the soil that afects the ability of seeds to acquire light. Thus,research on the effect of light on seed germination can indirectly reflect the burial depth of seeds. ",

        "text": "Ephemeral plants are a group of plant species that are able to complete their life cycle quickly and successfully at the end of spring or the beginning of summer by using the available melting snow and rain water (Ueckermann and van Rooyen, 20oo; Huang et al., 2015). Ephemeral plants are mainly distributed in the desert of Central Asia, the coastal of Mediterranean and the Gurbantunggut Desert，China (El-Keblawy，2003；Yao and Tan，2005；Lu et al.，2012). Particularly, ephemeral plants cover up to $40 \\%$ of the Gurbantunggut Desert in May,while shrubs and herbs cover less than $10 \\%$ of this area (Wang et al.,2OO3). Therefore,ephemeral plants are the main contributors to the stabilization of sand surface in early spring in the Gurbantunggut Desert. However， research on the efect of temperature and light on seed germination of ephemeral plants is rare,and that research has focused on seed germination of individual plants (Wang et al.，2003).Hence，we collected seeds from the 28 ephemeral plants in the Gurbantunggut Desert and performed seed germination experiments combining multiple temperature and light treatments in the laboratory to answer the following questions: (i) which temperature is the most suitable for seed germination of each plant? (ii) what is the response of sed germination to light and darkness? and (ii) depending on the responses of seed germination to light and temperature,which types of plants can be selected for vegetation restoration in the Gurbantunggut Desert?

Therefore,response of seed germination to temperature suggests the possible time within a year for vegetation restoration. In our study, the optimal temperature ranges of the 28 ephemeral plants in seed germination showed a great difference,such as $P .$ minuta, $L .$ semiglabra and $L .$ apetalum had the highest germination percentages between $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 1 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ， $T .$ kasahstanicus between $1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ，but $I .$ tataricum and $E$ ，inderiensis between $5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ，Therefore，the temperature requirement for germination is species-specific, some plants require low temperature, but others need moderate or higher temperature (Rosbakh and Poschlod, 2O15； El-Keblawy, 2017a). Based on the response of seed germination to temperature,we divided the 28 ephemeral plants into 5 groups. Considering the temperature change during spring in the Gurbantunggut Desert (Liu et al.,2O11),low temperature responsed plants should be sown before the end of March,because low temperature and soil moisture from melting snow and rainfall provides a suitable environment for seed germination in early spring.Moderate temperature responsed plants should be sown before mid-April, and high temperature responsed plants should be sown before May. Differently, non-responsed and non-germinated plants may be related to the seed dormancy that limits the response of seed germination to temperature.For example, seeds of $E .$ oxyrhinchum had physical dormancy (PD) (unpublished data),seeds of I. violascens had non-deep PD and intermediate PD (Zhou et al.,2O15)，seeds of $T .$ iliensis were dormant at maturity but when subjected to cold and dry (2 months at $4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ）followedbycoldandwet ( $( \\leq 4 0 \\mathrm { ~ d ~ }$ at $4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ）conditions, their seed germination percentage reached up to $9 6 \\%$ (Tang et al.，2009). Therefore, non-responsed and non-germinated plants should be sown in summer or autumn，which would allow the dormancy to be released by stratification temperature. ",

        "text": "In the field，seeds may be buried at different soil depths depending on wind and habitat characteristics,and the photon irradiance can be significantly decreased (Lai et al.,2015). Generally,it is believed that phototropic seeds need to be irradiated with red or white light to form more phytochrome to germinate; non-phototropic seeds require only a small amount of phytochrome to germinate， thus requiring a long period of darkness (Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2Oo6). Thus, plants responsed to light should be sown in soil surface or shallow soil. Plants responsed to darkness should be sown to a certain depth of soil, but the depth should not be too deep because being sown too deep also causes seed death via hypoxia. Non-responsed and non-germinated plants accounted for a large proportion in this study，and this result may be related to dormancy, thus limiting the response of seed to light. As suggested by Batlla and Benech-Arnold (2OO5) that the response of seed germination to light is gradually enhanced with dormancy loss progressed. In addition， theoretical models and empirical studies have also reported that smaller seeds tend to be positively photoblastic and larger seeds tend to be negatively photoblastic (Milberg et al.,200O; El-Keblawy,2017a,b). In our study, the results of some plants partly support the above findings. For example, seed germination percentage of $L .$ （204号 apetalum with smallseeds was significantly higher in light/darkness than in continuous darkness, but seed germination percentages of $I .$ tataricum and $E$ ，inderiensis with large seeds were significantly higher in continuous darkness than in light/darkness (Tables 1 and 2).In the field, especially for moving sand dunes, plants with large seeds avoided being blown away by wind as they might be buried into moving sand dunes. Therefore,response of seed germination to light provides a suggestion for sowing the seeds at different sand dune types and depths for vegetation restoration. ",

For semi-fixed sand dunes, the dune surface is covered by sparse vegetation, and the loss of soil water content is slower than that of moving sand dunes. Thus,plants with moderately rapid seed germination could be selected.For sand plains,the dune surface is covered by relatively more vegetation and soil water content is higher than those of the other dune types.

        "text": "Precipitation pattern mainly determines soil water content in the dune surface,which affects seed germination in the field (Flerchinger and Hardegree,2O04; Santos et al.,2013). Therefore,when we conduct vegetation restoration,distribution of precipitation should be considered. For the Gurbantunggut Desert, the period with the highest soil water content is early spring,followed by late autumn (Fig. 2).Therefore, plants of very rapid seed germination should be sown at this time. Plants with moderately rapid seed germination, such as $E .$ distans and $E$ .oxyrhinchum,often have a mild dormancy, and they may have bet-hedging strategies (bet-hedging is defined as a strategy that reduces the temporal variance in fitness at the expense of a lowered arithmetic mean fitness; Zhang et al., 2OO7). When rainfall is abundant in late autumn, seeds germinate and seedlings withstand the winter. When rainfall is scarce in autumn,seed germination will be delayed until the succeeding spring. Therefore, plants with moderately rapid seed germination should be sown in late autumn. Plants with moderate and low seed germination usually are dormant. Thus, plants with moderate and low seed germination should be sown after fruit or seeds disperse in summer in order to releasing dormancy. ",
