Herein，we report an environmentally friendly approach to obtain Co-doped $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ nanosheet networks using a laser-induced cobalt colloid as a doping precursor followed by an aging treatment in a hybrid medium of nickel ions. The shape and specific surface area of the doped $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ can be successfully adjusted by changing the concentration of sodium thiosulfate. Furthermore,a Co-doped $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ nanosheet network was further converted into Co-doped NiO with its pristine morphology retained via facile thermal decomposition in air. The structure and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared samples are investigated with scanning and transmisson electron microscopy， energy dispersive $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray analysis, $\\mathbf { X }$ ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy， the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm technique， and electrochemical measurements. The Co-doped $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ electrode shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance of $1 4 2 1 ~ \\mathrm { F / g }$ at a current density of $6 ~ \\mathrm { A / g }$ ，and a good retention level of $76 \\%$ after 1000 cycles,in sharp contrast with only a $47 \\%$ retention level of the pure $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ electrode at the same current density. In addition, the Co-doped NiO electrode exhibits a capacitance of $7 2 0 \\mathrm { F / g }$ at $6 \\mathrm { A } / \\mathrm { g }$ and （204号 $92 \\%$ retention after 1OoO cycles,which is also superior to those values for relevant pure NiO electrodes. The ${ \\mathrm { C o } } ^ { 2 + }$ partially substitutes for $\\mathrm { N i } ^ { 2 + }$ in the metal hydroxide and oxide, resulting in an increase of free holes in the valence band,and, therefore, enhancement of the $p$ -type conductivity of $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ and NiO. Moreover, such novel mesoporous nanosheet network structures are also able to enlarge the electrode-electrolyte contact area and shorten the path length for ion transport. The synergetic effect of these two results is responsible for the observed ultrahigh pseudocapacitor performance. ",

The morphology and specific surface area of the doped $\\mathrm { N i } ( \\mathrm { O H } ) _ { 2 }$ can be successfully adjusted by changing the concentration of sodium thiosulfate,and it can be easily converted into Co-doped NiO via thermal decomposition in air without changing its pristine morphology. The resulting Co-doped $\\mathrm { N i } ( \\mathrm { O H } ) _ { 2 }$ electrode exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance of $1 4 2 1 \\ \\mathrm { F / g }$ at $6 ~ \\mathrm { A / g }$ and a good retention level of $76 \\%$ after 100O cycles in 1 M KOH aqueous solution,and the Co-doped NiO electrode exhibits a capacitance of $7 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { F / g }$ and $92 \\%$ retention under the same conditions. The performance of both pseudocapacitors is dramatically improved compared to that of undoped components. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that Co-doping and morphology control strategies can efectively improve pseudocapacitor performance of nickel hydroxide and oxide. The enhanced pseudocapacitor performance can be attributed to the synergetic effect contribution from improved electronic conductivity, low crystalline structure, higher specific surface area, and more mesoporosities, which will enlarge the electrode-electrolyte contact area and shorten the path length for ion transport. This work provides an innovative approach for fabricating Co-doped $\\mathrm { N i ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ nanomaterials； more significantly,it is instructive for construction of other mesoporous and doped metal oxides and hydroxides for broader applications,such as electrocatalytic water oxidation,active layers for hybrid solar cells,and electrode materials for lithium ion batteries.
