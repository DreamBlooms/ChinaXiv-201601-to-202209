Using the velocities of the two fision fragments,the fission events are reconstructed.The broadening ofboth the velocity distribution and the azimuthaldiference of the fision fragments decrease with the folding angle,in accordance with the picture that fast fission occurs.The anisotropic angular distribution of the fission axis also reveals consistently the dynamic feature the fission events.

        "text": "2 One of the purposes of studying the heavy ion reactions   \n3 (HIR) is to infer the properties of nuclear equation of state   \n4 (EOS), which is an essential input in modeling and computing   \n5 the evolution and properties of neutron stars and their merging   \n6 [1-3].The isovector sector of the nuclear EOS,namely the   \n7 density behavior of the symmetry energy $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ , has been   \n8 a long-standing open question in nuclear physics.At Fermi   \n9 energies,some observables have been identified to constrain   \n10 $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ near normal density,including isospin diffusion,   \n11 dipole polarizability and particle emissions etc [4-1O]. Very   \n12 recently, the PREX II experiment has reported the result of the   \n13 neutron skin thickness,which yields a stiff $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ in ten  \n14 tion with previously existing constraints [11,12]. At supra  \n15 saturation densities,many experiments have been progressed   \n16 greatly to measure the charged pion ratios or collective flow in   \n$^ { 1 7 }$ heavy ion collisions to probe $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ [13,14]. An External  \n18 target Experiment on HIRFL-CSR(CEE)is under construc  \n19 tion for the studies on this direction [15,16].   \n20 Nuclear fission is a large-amplitude collective motion   \n21 mode involving up to hundreds of nucleons. Recently the   \n22 studies on nuclear fission have been revived for its signifi  \n23 cance in both nuclear physics and astrophysics.In the stel  \n$2 4$ lar environment,the abundance of the nuclide in $A \\approx 1 6 0$   \n25 region is significantly influenced by the recycling of the fis  \n26 sion products [17-19].Theoretically,statistical fission has   \n27 been described well by microscopical theories and various   \n28 phenomenological approaches [2O-32]. When the excita  \n29 tion energy or the angular momentum becomes much high,   \n3o as achieved in HIRs well above the Coulomb barrier, the   \n31 fission barrier tends to vanish． As a consequence,the fis  \n32 sion time scale becomes shorter by a factor of 1O to 100   \n33 and the variance of the mass asymmetry increases signifi  \n34 cantly (the mass asymmetry $\\eta$ of the two fragments can be   \n35 larger than O.6),compared to the statistical fission [33-37].   \n36 In this case, the dynamic feature of the fission process is of   \n37 significance and the transport models have been successfully   \n38 applied to describe the fast fission process [38-46].Time  \n39 dependent Hartree-Fock theory can also give an excellent de  \n40 scription of fast fission starting with large deformation [47].   \n41Experimentally,fast fission,usuallytermedasdynamicfis  \n42 sion because of its vanishing fission barrier and short time   \n43 scale,has been investigated in various systems in the last three   \n44 decades [48-54].   \n45 The topic of fast fission with the simultaneous emission of   \n46 the particles deserves further investigations because the fis  \n$_ { 4 7 }$ sioning system provides an appropriate laboratory to probe   \n48 $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ . The connection between the studies of fast fission   \n49 and $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ has been recently established by the simula  \n50 tions with improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD)   \n51 [55,56]. It is suggested that fast fission process follow  \n52 ing HIR carries the effect of $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ and provides sensi  \n53 tive probes,because of the formation of the low-density and   \n54 neutron-rich neck and oflarger surface of two fragments com  \n55 pared to the non-fission process [56,57]. The isospin content   \n56 of the light particles emitted from the fast fission events has   \n$^ { 5 7 }$ been used to probe $E _ { \\mathrm { s y m } } ( \\rho )$ experimentally [10].   \n58 In order to conduct the experimental studies of the fast fis  \n59 sion and the coincident emission of light charged particles   \n6o (LCP) and intermediate mass fragments (IMFs),a compact   \n61 spectrometer for heavy ion experiment(CSHINE) has been   \n62 built [58, 59]. While the LCPs and IMFs are measured using   \n63 the silicon strip detector telescopes (SSDT) [6O,61], the fis  \n64 sion fragments are measured by the parallel plate avalanche   \n65 counters (PPACs) [62].

The signals induced by the incident fragments on an   \n104 individual wire of the anode plane,either $\\mathrm { \\Delta } \\mathrm { X }$ or Y,are trans  \n105 ferred through a delay line to both ends.The time delay of   \n106 the two signals $X _ { 1 }$ and $X _ { 2 }$ 0 $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot Y _ { 1 } \\mathbf { \\nabla }$ and $Y _ { 2 }$ ）withrespect to the   \n107 signal collected on the cathode plane,which delivers the tim  \n108 ing information，gives the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ (Y）position of the hit in the   \n109 sensitive area.Fig.2 presents the schematic view of the me  \n110 chanics of the PPAC.The total thickness of the sensitive gas   \n111 volume is about $2 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ .The PPACs were operated with 4.5   \n112 mbar isobutane at $4 6 5 ~ \\mathrm { V }$ voltage.Under this condition, the   \n113 fission fragments can be recorded with efficiency above $9 5 \\%$   \n114 but the LCPs and IMFs are suppressed.   \n115 Fig. 3 (b) shows a two-dimensional histogram of $Y _ { 1 } - Y _ { 2 }$   \n116 US $X _ { 1 } - X _ { 2 }$ for PPAC1 as an example. The projections to $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$   \n117 and Y direction are plotted in Fig. 3 (a) and (c),respectively.   \n118 A good performance in timing, corresponding to good posi  \n119 tion resolution,manifests itself in the sharp boundary for the   \n120 two-dimensional distribution and the well-separated individ  \n121 ual peaks on the projections.The distance of the neighboring   \n122 Wires is $4 \\mathrm { m m }$ ,and there are 61 peaks and 71 peaks in Fig. 3   \n123 (a) and (c),respectively.

Multi   \n131 tracks may fire each SSDT.In order to reconstruct the tracks   \n132 in the SSDTs,a novel algorithm has been developed with spe  \n133 cial care on the charging sharing effect.More than $80 \\%$ of the   \n134 hits inall layers of the SSDTs can be recognized and assigned   \n135 to certain tracks.For details,one can refer to [60].   \n136 The trigger system of CSHINE was designed for both beam   \n137 experiment and calibration. The timing signals of PPACs   \n138 Were discriminated by CF8OOO and logically calculated by a   \n139 CO4O2O to generate the PPAC inclusive signals and PPAC   \n140 two body coincidence signals.The logic hit signals of SSDTs   \n141 Were extracted by the front-side of the DSSSD $( \\Delta E _ { 2 } )$ with   \n142 the discrimination of MSCF-16,which generates an analog   \n143 Multi-Trig signal proportional to the number of fired strips in   \n144 the same module(16 channels).Both inclusive and exclusive   \n145 logic signals can be generated by discriminating the Multi  \n146 Trig signal at different threshold settings.In beam experi  \n147 ment, the trigger signal contains SSD two body events,PPAC   \n148 two body events and the coincidence of PPAC two body with   \n149 SSD one body events.Besides,the inclusive trigger for every   \n150 individual detector were also constructed, optionally turned   \n151 on for the detector calibration before or after the beam data  \n152 taking.For details,one can refer to [60].

The fraction of the momentum of the projectile transferred to the TLF is called linear momentum transfer (LMT).With a certain probability depending on the total angular momentum of the reaction system, the TLF may undergo fission or fast fission in competition with the emission residue channel. For the fission events,Fig.6 presents the kinetic geometry of the TLF fission event.

Here the $v _ { \\mathrm { f _ { 1 } } }$ is for the FF recorded in PPAC1 and $v _ { \\mathrm { f _ { 2 } } }$ is   \n247 for the FF in PPAC2(PPAC3) in $\\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \\times 2$ $( { \\mathrm { P P A C 1 } } \\times 3 )$ （2   \n248 events.It is shown that for the $\\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \\times 2$ events, since the   \n249 two PPACs are nearly symmetric W.r.t the beam,the distribu  \n250 tions of $v _ { \\mathrm { f _ { 1 } } }$ and $v _ { \\mathrm { f _ { 2 } } }$ are very similar. Meanwhile,high velocity   \n251 tail is evidently presented in the $\\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \\times 2$ events and the   \n252 velocity spectra are wider than that in $\\mathrm { P P A C 1 \\times 3 }$ events.   \n253 This component is mainly due to the events with smaller fold  \n254 ing angle corresponding to largerLMT,as will be discussed   \n255 below.   \n256 After thevelocities of the two FFs aredetermined, the fold  \n257 ing angle method can be applied to calculate the LMT of the   \n258 reaction.Recalling the definitions in Fig. 6, the folding angle   \n259 $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ is defined as the angle $\\angle A O C$ ，spanned bythe projec  \n$2 6 0$ tion of the velocity vectors of the FFs on the projection plane.   \n$2 6 1$ Clearly, given the velocities $\\Vec { v } _ { \\mathrm { f _ { 1 } } }$ and $\\Vec { v } _ { \\mathrm { f _ { 2 } } }$ ,the folding angle de  \n262 pends on the velocity of the TLF $v _ { \\mathrm { t l } }$ ,i.e.,the larger $v _ { \\mathrm { t l } }$ ，the   \n263 smaller $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ . Fig.8 presents the distribution of the folding   \n$2 6 4$ angle $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ .The coincident events of $\\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \\times 2$ distribute   \n265 in the range between $7 0 ^ { \\circ } - 1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ with the peak situating at   \n266 about $9 5 ^ { \\circ }$ ，corresponding to a larger LMT (red)，while the   \n267 $\\mathrm { P P A C 1 \\times 3 }$ events sit in the range of $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ } - 1 7 0 ^ { \\circ }$ corre  \n268 sponds to a smallerLMT (blue).The valley between the two   \n269 components is simply due to the deficiency caused by the gap   \n270 between PPAC2 and PPAC3,and the efficiency arising from   \n271 the incomplete azimuthal coverage is not corrected in the plot.   \n272As the fission geometry is determined by the two velocity   \n273 vectors,it is of interest to look at the planarity of the fission   \n274 events. Fig. 9 (a) present the azimuth correlation of the two   \n275 FFs by scattering plot between the azimuthal angle difference   \n276 $\\Delta \\phi$ and the folding angle $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ . It is clearly shown that for the   \nFFs from both the central and peripheral reactions,the most   \n278 probable value situates at $\\Delta \\phi = 1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ following the picture   \nthat the system undergoes a binary decay. Here we note that   \n280 the $\\Delta \\phi$ isa directly measurable quantity relying on no as  \n281 sumption. The inset displays the projection distribution of   \n282 $\\Delta \\phi$ ,astandard deviation of about $\\sigma ( \\Delta \\phi ) \\approx 1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ is derived.   \n283 Such broadening suggests that the emission of LCPs or IMFs   \n284 may change the flight direction of the FF and smear the back  \n285 to-back feature of the fission event. In order to see its evolu  \n286 tion with the violence of the reaction,we plot in panel (b) the   \n287 standard deviation of azimuthal angle $\\sigma ( \\Delta \\phi )$ as a function   \n288 of folding angle $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ . It is shown that $\\sigma ( \\Delta \\phi )$ decreases with   \n289 $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ in the whole range,with an exception near $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } } \\approx 1 3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ，   \n290 where a discontinuity appears due to the gap between PPAC2   \n291 and PPAC3．To exclude the possible reason that this trend   \n292 originates from the asymmetry of the geometrical locations of   \n293 the PPACs,we restrict further the analysis on the events with   \n294 the two FFs flying symmetrically to the beam direction,i.e.,   \n295 with the condition of $\\theta _ { 1 } = \\theta _ { 2 }$ ，where $\\theta _ { i }$ is the polar angle of   \n296 the $i ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ fragment. The result is depicted by the black squares,   \n297 where the bin width of each $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ is $\\pm 2 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ . This condition   \n298 is applicable only for the $\\mathrm { P P A C 1 } \\times 2$ fission events because   \n299 these two PPACs are placed in approximate left-right sym  \n30o metry with respect to the beam line.Clearly seen,the data   \n301 points with the symmetry condition are sitting on top of those   \n302 without the condition, suggesting that the decreasing trend of   \n303 $\\sigma ( \\Delta \\phi )$ as function of $\\Theta _ { \\mathrm { F F } }$ is truly due to the reaction vio  \n304 lence. Since the post-scission particle emission changes the   \n305 velocity of the FF due to recoil effect, the trend suggests that   \n306 in the fission following the intermediate energy heavy ion re  \n307 actions,there is sufficient excitation energy left at the scission   \n308 point depending on LMT. In the reactions with larger LMT,   \n309 more excitation energy is left and released through the parti  \n310 cle emission in the post-scission stage.It is consistent with   \n311 the picture of fast fission,instead of statistic fission in which   \n312 the excitation energy is nearly depleted at the scission point.   \n313 The dynamic feature of the fast fission can be further ex  \n314 plored from the velocity distribution of the FFs.We present   \n315 in Fig.1O the average(a) and the standard deviation (b) of   \n316 the velocities of the FFs recorded in the PPACs as a func  \n317 tion of folding angle. From panel (a),it can be seen that   \n318 the average velocity value $\\langle v _ { \\mathrm { f } } \\rangle$ decreases with the folding an  \n319 gle.Panel (b) presents the standard deviation of the velocity   \n320 $\\sigma ( v _ { f } )$ ,and it is also clear that the broadening of the velocity   \n321 of the FFs decreases with the folding angle.This result is con  \n322 sistent with the picture seen in the trend of $\\sigma ( \\Delta \\phi )$ in figure 9.   \n323 The scission point is early reached when the excitation energy   \n324 of the fissioning TLF is still high,thus,the statistical fluctu  \n325 ation(corresponding to the left excitation energy） enhances   \n326 the variance of the velocity of the FF.This is consistent with   \n327 the earlier experimental observation in $\\mathrm { A r + ^ { 2 0 9 } }$ Bi reactions   \n328at $2 5 \\mathrm { { M e V / u } }$ [64, 65].
