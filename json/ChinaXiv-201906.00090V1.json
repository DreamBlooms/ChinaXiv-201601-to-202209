M. dendrisetosum was confirmed as a distinct species, obviously different from M. sanguineum. This species is narrowly endemic and extremely endangered.The authors provide the latest morphological description of M. dendrisetosum, aiming to lay a foundation for the precise identification and future conservation of this species.

This treatment was followed by the same author in Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinicae (Chen,1984).However, in Flora of China (Chen & Renner, 2OO7） Chen and Renner followed Meyer's (Meyer,2OOl） revision and recognized only five Chinese taxa and incorporated M. dendrisetosum and M. penicillatum into M. sanguineum. However, subsequent studies indicated that M. penicillatum was a distinct species from both morphological characteristics and molecular results (Chao et al.,2O14); Huang et al.'s research indicated that M. dendrisetosum was an independent species mainly based on from the difference in the indumentum of the hypanthium and the molecular results (2O18); however, there are other morphological diferences between the two，and the taxonomic status of M. dendrisetosum also needs to be further assessed from multiple perspectives.

        "text": "Leaves are one of the important vegetative organs of plants,and are also one of the important bases for plant species identification (Zeng et al.，2O17). In plant taxonomic studies，leaf characteristics are next only to the those of flowers and fruits (Wang et al.,2Ol2; Li et al.,2010; Yang et al.，2O16). The leaf epidermis of plants has certain genetic stability，and thus,the micromorphological characteristics of leaf epidermis are of important research value for interspecies or intergeneric classfication (Zeng et al., 2O17) and the microscopic morphological characteristics of leaves have been increasingly used in the study of modern plant taxonomy and in the classification and identification of difficult groups (Peng et al.,2O11; Xu et al. 2O13; Yang et al.,2O16). Epidermal hair is the most common appendage on plant leaves,and its distribution characteristics and morphological characteristics are important means of plant identification and taxonomic study (Baran & Zdemir, 2OO9; Wang et al., 2O15). Epidermal hair is confirmed as a classification feature with applied value for interspecies classification (Yang et al.,2O16). Stomata are the subsidiary structure of leaf epidermis and are evolved from epidermal cells during long-term development. The density of stomatal organs is also different among species,and can be used as the basis of species classification (Zeng et al., 2O17). The results of previous studies have proved that sporopollen is an important basis for plant classification (Shao & Fan,2O03). The morphological characteristics of flower pollens are controlled genetically and have strong stability and genetic conservatism, which are not easily affected by environmental factors.Pollen grain size, shape,and outer wall ornamentation can be used to study plant classification (Erdtman,1978; Xu, 2007).When the classical morphological method proves difficult to solve the problem of classification, study of pollen morphology and surface ornamentation often plays a very valuable role (Zhang & Zhou,1998; Zhang et al.,2001; Zhang,2004; Yan & Li, 2003a,b; Zhang et al., 2014; Hong et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017).
