Recently, increasing evidence has shown that GAA triplet-repeat-induced chromatin changes may be responsible for the FXN mRNA deficits.Saveliev et al.found that expanded GAA triplet-repeats served as a source of HP-1-mediated heterochromatin to silence a nearby reporter gene [17]. Subsequently, several studies have suggested that the expansion of the FRDA GAA triplet-repeats can cause epigenetic changes,such as H3-K9 hypermethylationand reductions in histone acetylation. The GAA tripletrepeats can also recruit heterochromatin-binding proteins.Further, the formation of heterochromatin on intron 1 of the FXN gene may trigger FXN gene silencing through an intrinsic blocking of transcription initiation or elongation [11,18-27]. Ruan etal. found that the efficiency of nucleosome assembly on pure $\\mathsf { G A A } _ { 2 2 }$ repeat duplex was only half that of the pUC control DNA. Compared with duplex DNA in vitro,the GAA/ GAA/TTC triplex further reduced nucleosome assembly efficiency [10]. ",

        "text": "The weak nucleosome assembly on the GAA triplet-repeats was likely due to the abundance of AA dinucleotides.Nucleosome positioning along the genome mightbe determined primarilyby the preference of DNA sequences [32-38] and by external factors,such as chromatin remodeling,DNA methylation,histone variants,post-translational modifications,and polymerase II binding[28,38,39].An in vivo genome-wide survey of nucleosome positions and reconstituted chromatin structures in vitro suggested that local nucleosome positioning around GAA tripletrepeats was mediated primarily by the primary sequence.The homopolymeric stretches of deoxyadenosine nucleotides were identified as strong determinants of nucleosome organization,such as poly(dA:dT). The poly(dA:dT) tract disfavors nucleosome formation [37,4O] and has been strongly associated with nucleosome depletion in vivo [34,41] and invitro [34,39,42].Besides,DNA flexibility could alsoaffectnucleosome assembly [43].Given the flexibility of dinucleotides,the AA dinucleotideisrelatively stiff. Of the12 trinucleotides,the flexibilityof GAA is slightly higher than that of CAA and AAA[44]. Our previous work also indicated that the A-rich region (especially the poly-A region) is relatively rigid [45].The weak flexible GAA trinucleotides in the sequence may have caused greater free energy for the bending of the repeats, allowing them to wrap around histones.Therefore the lots of energetic cost decrease nucleosome assembly on the triplet-repeats and the flanking sequence,which might alter the local nucleosome positioning around GAA triplet-repeats.

In our work,the nucleosome depletion pattern on GAA triplet-repeats was investigated in cells obtained from unaffected individuals.In the disease condition, the nucleosome occupancy and dynamic repositioning may be primarilyaffected by epigenetic signals or other external factors rather than by the preferences of DNA sequences.The GAA triplet-repeats with lowaffinity to octamers may have higher nucleosome occupancy in response to some regulatory signals,although these responses have high energy demands to change their conformations.
