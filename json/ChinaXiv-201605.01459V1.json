        "text": "The biotin biosynthesis pathway isan atractive target for development of novel drugs against mycobacterial pathogens,however there are as yet no suitable inhibitors that target this pathway in mycobacteria. 7-Keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase(KAPA synthase, BioF)is the enzyme which catalyzes the first committed step of the biotin synthesis pathway,but both its structure and function in mycobacteria remain unresolved. Here we present the crystal structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis BioF(MsBioF). The structure revealsan incomplete dimer,and the active site organization is similar to,butdistinct from Escherichia coli 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (EcAONS),the E.coli homologue of BioF.To investigatethe influence of structural characteristics on thefunction of MsBioF,we deleted bioFin M.smegmatis and confirmed that BioF is required for growth in the absence of exogenous biotin.Based on structural and mutagenesis studies,we confirmed that pyridoxal $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -phosphate(PLP) binding site residues His129, Lys235 and His2OO are essential for MsBioF activity in vivo and residue Glu171 playsan important,but not essentialrole in MsBioFactivity.The N-terminus (residues 1-37)isalso essential for MsBioF activity in vivo.The structure and function of MsBioF reported here provides further insights for developing new anti-tuberculosis inhibitors aimed at the biotin synthesis pathway.

Accumulating evidence shows that the de novo biotin biosynthesis pathway is essential for the survival and growth of mycobacteria ina variety of living environments (Keer etal.,2ooO; Sassetti and Rubin, 2003; Rengarajan et al., 2005; Dey et al., 2010; Woong Park et al.,2011;Yu et al., 2011). The biotin biosynthesis pathway has therefore been considered as a potential target for the development of new antibiotics. ",

        "text": "The biotin synthesis pathway can divided into two parts,namely biotin pimelate moiety synthesis and four subsequent conserved steps carried out by four committed enzymes (Salaemae et al., 2011；Lin et al.,201O),namely 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase (KAPAS or BioF)，7,8-diaminopelargonic acid synthase (DAPAS or BioA),dethiobiotin synthetase(DTBS or BioD)and biotin synthase(BS or BioB).KAPA synthase,the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of the biotin synthesis pathway,isa pyridoxal $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -phosphate(PLP)-dependent enzyme belonging to subclass I of the aminotransferase family (Alexeev et al.,1998;Bhor et al., 2006). Ithas been studied in detail in microbes like Escherichia coli (Alexeev et al., 1998;Webster et al., 2000; Alexeev et al., 2006), Bacillus subtilis (Snapper etal.,199O) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bower et al.,1996;Ploux and Marquet,1996;Ploux et al., 1999). Similarities in the sequences of the enzymes in these organisms and the reactions they catalyze suggest that they share a common catalytic mechanism(Bhor et al.,2Oo6). The crystal structures of KAPA synthase from E. coli (PDB code 1BSO,Alexeev etal.,1998) and Francisella tularensis SCHU S4（PDB code 4IW7）have been solved.The structure of E.coli 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (EcAONS),the E.coli KAPA synthase homologue,consists of two protomers,each protomer being composed of three domains,the small N-terminal,large central and C-terminal domains.Its cofactor,pyridoxal $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -phosphate (PLP),iscovalentlyattached to Lys236and can be seen in the X-ray structure at the junction between the $\\beta$ -sheets at the bottom of the deep cleft formed between the central and C-terminal domains (PDB code 1DJE,Webster et al.,2O0O).The othercatalytic site residues:His133,Glu175,Asp204 and His207, arelocated in the central domain,flanking the cleft.Though both the structure and the mechanism of the E.coli homologue of BioF, EcAONS,have been well studied, the structure and function of BioF in mycobacteria remains unresolved.

TheMycobacteriumsmegmatis genome encodes only one bioF gene (MSMEG_3189,MsbioF).MsBioF shares $7 6 \\%$ identity with MtBioF1 and $3 5 \\%$ identitywiththeBioFdomainofMtBioF2.The study ofBioA and BioD,the enzymes catalyzing the second and third of the four conserved steps in M.tuberculosis biotin synthesis suggests that there are significant differences between the enzymes in the biotin synthesis pathway of mycobacteria and those of other organisms (Dey et al., 201O). In contrast to B. sphaericus (Ploux et al.,1999), D-alanine is a substrate rather than a competitive inhibitor of BioF in M.tuberculosis,demonstrating the broad substrate specificity of the mycobacterial enzyme (Bhor et al.,2oo6).We therefore expect that mycobacterial BioF mayalso be different from that in other organisms.

Here we modeled 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid-PLP(KAM） into the structure of MsBioF by aligning itwith the homologous structure 1DJ9(Webster et al.,20oO) containing KAM. As shown in Fig.2A,both subunits of the‘catalytic dimer'contribute to an active site to bind KAM,which liesat the subunit and domain interface.The PLP head ofKAM is located in the bottom of the cleft between the large domain and the C-terminal domain of one protomer.The long tail of pimeloylCoA lies in the cavity formed by the small N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of one monomer and the large domain of the other.Combining structural information with that obtained from sequence alignment of MsBioF and EcAONS,we identified five conserved residuesin MsBioF,His129,Glu171,Asp200,His203 and Lys235,corresponding to residues His133,Glu175,Asp204, His207,and Lys236 in EcAONS,as putative catalytic site residues (Fig.2B and C).All these residues are located on the loops of the large domain except for Glu171 which liesat the terminus of $\\beta 4$ These residues interact with the PLP head of KAM,and the long carbonchain ofKAMis surrounded by three loops,residues21-33 of one protomer(A),and residues 72-83 and 258-264 of the other protomer (B)(Fig.2B).According to previous reports,atom NZ of Lys235 in the putative active site can covalently bind atom C4A of cofactor PLP,the carboxylate of Asp2oO is hydrogen-bonded to atom N1 of PLP,and atom O3 of PLP is hydrogen-bonded to His203 (Alexeev etal.,1998). Glu171 is negatively charged and pairs with Ser175(Ser179 in EcAONS) to remove the proton from the O3 of PLP byinteractingwith His133,and His207 (Webster et al.,2000).The location and orientation of Glu171,Asp2o0,His203,and Lys235 are very similar to those in EcAONS.However,residue His129 has two different conformations differing from each other mainly by main chain conformation and imidazole ring orientation: the imidazole ring of the His129 of one protomer faces in the opposite direction of the cleft,while the His129 of the other protomer faces in the same directionas that in EcAONS.AsHis133 in EcAONS formsa parallel, stacked arrangement with the PLP ring via the side chain and plays animportant role in the mechanism (Webster et al.,2ooo;Alexeev et al.,1998),we speculate that the side chain (an imidazolyl group) conformation of His129 in MsBioF may be regulated by its adjacent residues,translocating from the former to the latter conformation, and is then involved in PLP recognition,in a manner similar to that described for EcAONS.

In the absence of exogenous biotin,the wild type strain still grew, but the △MsbioF strain did not (Fig.4A and B).To further confirm that the inability of the △MsbioF strain to grow in the absence of exogenous biotin was actually caused by knockout of MsbioF,we constructed pMV261:MsbioF,a complementary plasmid containingthe MsbioF gene,usingWestern blottingto show that it could express MsBioF.Results showed that,like the wild type,the complemented mutant strain could grow in the presence or absence of biotin (Fig.4C).Together,these results show that MsbioF plays anessential role in the growth of M.smegmatis in theabsence of exogenous biotin.In addition,we determined the minimal concentration ofbiotin required for△MsbioF to growat the same rateas the wild type.When the concentration of biotin was lower than 5 nM,△MsbioF showed little or no growth (Fig.4D).The growth of △MsbioF reached wild type level only when the biotin concentrationwas higher than $5 0 \\mathrm { n M }$ ,which isat least5-fold greaterthan the concentration of biotin in normal human plasma(Mock and Malik, 1992).These observations on M.smegmatis,together with previous reports on M. tuberculosis (Sassetti and Rubin,2OO3;Dey et al., 2010),indicate that de novo synthesis of biotinis required forboth fast-growing and slow-growing mycobacteria.

In addition,all mycobacterial species contain BioF.M. smegmatis contains onlyone copy of the bioF gene（MSMEG_3189）while M. tuberculosis containstwo copies (bioF1(Rv1569）and bioF2(Rv0032)) (Salaemae etal.,2O11).Though there isa high level of active residue sequenceidentitybetweenMtbioF1andMtbioF2,onlyMtbioF1has been shown to play an essential role in M. tuberculosis growth in vitro and M. tuberculosis infection and survival in mice (Dey et al.,2O1O;Sassetti and Rubin,2Oo3). This indicates that there is noredundancy between MtbioF1 and MtbioF2.The M.smegmatis protein MsBioF protein shares $7 6 \\%$ identitywith the M.tuberculosis protein MtBioF1and $3 5 \\%$ identity with the BioF domain of MtBioF2, and active sites are conserved in the three proteins.Here,to determine if the role of BioF is conserved across the mycobacteria,we assessed whether MtbioF1 and MtbioF2 could complement for the deletionof MsbioF.ComplementationwithMtbioF1 removed the dependence of M.smegmatis △MsbioFon exogenous biotin(Fig.7A), but complementation with MtbioF2 was unable to do so (Fig.7B). We constructeda MtBioF2 truncation lacking theadditional acetyltransferase domain that is present inMtBioF2 but notMtBioF1and observed its BioF activity(Fig.7C).Results showed that the MtBioF2 truncation was also not able to complement △MsbioF,suggesting thatMtBioF2 isunlikelyto playarole in biotin synthesis.BioF thus playsa conserved role in mycobacterial biotin synthesis.

        "text": "In this study,we have determined the structure of MsBioF, the KAPA synthase enzyme of the M.smegmatis biotin synthesis pathway,and investigated its function by generatingan MsbioF deletion strain (△MsbioF).A recent report on the structures of BioA and BioD in M.tuberculosis suggests that there are significant differences between M. tuberculosis and other organisms in enzymes involved in the biotin synthesis pathway (Dey et al.,201O). Our studyhas confirmed thatthere are also distinct differences between MsBioF and EcAONS,the homologue of MsBioF in E.coli.We have shown that the key MsBioF residues involved in biotin synthesis in vivo (Fig.5), for example,are different from those of EcAONS (Alexeev etal., 1998). Alexeev etal. (1998) speculated that His207 in EcAONS may play an important role in substrate binding and catalysis through formation of a hydrogen-bond with atom O3 of PLP.However,in our study,mutation of His2o3,the residue corresponding to His2O7 in MsBioF,had no influence on the growth of M. smegmatis (Fig.5C). In contrast to His133 of EcAONS,His 129, the corresponding residue in MsBioF,has two conformations which may be regulated by its adjacent residues.In addition,residues 23-37,which connect the α1 of the N-terminal small domain and the central domain,forma flexible loop in MsBioF,while the corresponding segment in EcAONS folds into a two-stranded $\\beta$ -sheet (Fig.1C).The flexibility of this loop made it difficult to resolve the complete structure of protomer B,resulting in the structure of MsBioF presented here beingan incomplete dimer.To identify the role of the N-terminal domain,we complemented △MsbioF with MsBioF truncation mutants lacking residues 1-37 or 1-22 (Fig.6A). Results confirmed that the N-terminal domain,especially helix $\\alpha$ 1of MsBioF,is essential for biotin synthesis (Fig. 6C and D). This,together with a previous report that the N-terminal domain plays an important role in the dimerization of EcAONS (Alexeev et al.,1998),led us to conclude that dimerization of MsBioF via domain swapping is required for MsBioF activity.Our functional experiments on MtBioF1(Fig.2A),in agreement with sequence alignments(Fig. S1),indicate that the function and structure of BioFis conserved among the mycobacteria.Although amiclenomycin,a natural product isolated from Streptomyces lavendulae (Mann and Ploux,2oo6),can inhibit the growth of M.tuberculosisin vitro through inhibiting BioA(Okami etal.,1974), it has been shown to be inactive ina mouse model of M.tuberculosis (Kitahara et al.,1975),possibly due to its poor pharmacokinetic behavior (Woong Park etal.,2O11).The structural and functional characteristics of mycobacterial BioF elaborated here thus provide two new insights for the design of inhibitors of the biotin synthesis pathwayinmycobacteria.Firstly,inhibitorswhich target keyresidues (His129,Asp2o0 and Lys235) of the active site could be designed to prevent PLP binding.It has been reported that although PLP can covalently attach to Lys236 in the active site of EcAONS,the enzyme isapt to lose the PLP cofactor during crystallization (Webster et al., 2000;Alexeev et al.,1998). Our results indicate that this phenomenon also exists in MsBioF.Based on our study and a previous report on EcAONS,we propose that bonding between all KAPA synthase enzymes and cofactor PLP is weak.Designing inhibitors to prevent the binding of PLP to mycobacterial BioF should thus be considered.Secondly,anti-mycobacterial drugs could be designed to interfere with the dimerization of BioF. Only the N-terminal domain of one protomer Was observed here in the MsBioF dimer structure,suggesting that helix α1 is wobbly and the dimerization of MsBioF through domain swapping is prone to instability. Therefore,anti-mycobacterial drugs designed to target dimerization of mycobacterial BioFwould likely inhibit the biotinsynthesis pathway.One potential strategy would be to design a hydrocarbon stapled peptide drug (Walensky and Bird, 2014;Walensky et al., 2004) to inhibit the dimerization of MsBioF by competitively binding the central domain and N-terminal domain.

        "text": "In summary,this structural study is the first to solve the structure of a mycobacterial KAPA synthase and demonstrates that pyridoxal $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -phosphate(PLP) binding site residues His129,Lys235 and His2OO are essential for MsBioF activity in vivo,and that dimerization of MsBioF via domain swapping is required for biotin synthesis inM.smegmatis.We furthervalidated that de novo biotin synthesis is required inM.smegmatis.Our study of the structure and function of MsBioF provides new insights into the role mycobacterial BioF plays in biotin synthesis and also open up avenues for the development of novel inhibitors against mycobacterial pathogens suchasM.tuberculosis.
