Septic shock is caused by severe infection of the invading microbes that produces endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria or analogous molecules from gram-positive bacteria or other fungi. Endotoxins are bacterial membrane lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and are the major component of the outer membranes in Gram-negative bacteria. In Gram-negative sepsis,LPS (endotoxin) induces profound activation of macrophages and production of potent inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- $\\mathbf { \\alpha } _ { \\mathrm { ~ \\mathfrak { ~ a ~ } ~ } }$ , IL-1 and IL-6 [2]. These proinflammatory cytokines act on endothelial cells to cause systemic vasodilatation, diminished myocardial contractility, endothelial injury and activation, resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Activation of TLR signaling through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns leads to the transcriptional activation of genes encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the way of PI3K/Akt, which in turn control the activation of antigen-specific adaptive immune response [31].To understand the concise mechanism of Appl2 that regulates inflammation, we hypothesized that Appl2 may interact with the TLR4 receptor because it has been reported to increase Akt phosphorylation in a TLR4 high expression cell line [32-34]. Opposite to our expectation, binding between the Appl2 and TLR4 was not observed. MyD88 is an important protein in TLR signaling pathways by dimerizing with the TLR receptors [26].Binding between the Appl2 and MyD88 was not observed either. Some study showed that MyD88 can form a complex with PI3-kinase,an important regulatory protein of Akt [26,35]. Therefore，Appl2 may be involved in the downstream of TLR4 pathway. As expected, PI3K apparently interacted with Appl2. These results are consistent with those of a previous paper, wherein Appl2 suppresses insulin signaling pathway and Akt phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent manner [30]. Our results also showed that Appl2 can interact with Appllwhen challenged by LPS. These results indicate that a complex formed by Appl1, Appl2 and PI3K likely exists, and Appl2 has a negative effect on the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and therefore, the expression of downstream genes involved in inflammation.
