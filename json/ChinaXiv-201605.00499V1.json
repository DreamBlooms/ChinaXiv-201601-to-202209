Thus, we measured field-scale $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ flux over 5 years (2005-2007,2010-2011) from an annual crop rotation to evaluate how $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions are influenced by no-till (NT) compared to conventional tillge (CV),and how crop residue removal $( \\mathbb { R } - )$ rather than crop residue return to soil $( \\mathbb { R } + )$ affects emissions from these two tillage systems.Data from all 5 years indicated no differences in $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ flux between tillage practices at the onset of the growing season, but CT had $1 . 4 { - } 6 . 3$ times higher $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ flux than NT overwinter. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher due to $\\mathrm { R - }$ compared to $\\mathbb { R } ^ { + } .$ ， but the effect was more marked under CT than NT and overwinter than during spring. Our results thus challenge the assumption based on IPCC methodology thatcrop residue removal willresult in reduced $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions.The potential for higher $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emission with residue removal implies that the benefit of utilizing biomassas biofuels to mitigate greenhouse gas emision may be overestimated. Interestingly,prior to an overwinter thaw event, dissolved organic C (DOC) was negatively correlated to peak $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ flux $( r = - 0 . 9 3 )$ ： This suggests that lower $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions with $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { R + } }$ vs. $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { R - } }$ may reflect more complete stepwise denitrification to $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ during winter and possibly relate to the heterotrophic microbial capacity for processing crop residue into more soluble C compounds and a shift in the preferential C source utilized by the microbial community overwinter.

        "text": "Cropresidue is increasinglyused asa feedstock source forbiofuel production,a practice claimed to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The influence of residue removal on $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions is often ignored in life cycle analyses for biofuel production,potentially leading to an overestimated benefit of biofuels to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (Smith & Searchinger, 2012). Based onIPCC emission factors,itis estimated that $1 \\%$ of Nin crop residue is converted into $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ (IPCC,2007),indicating that crop residue removal will consistently result in reduced $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions.However，studies have shown $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions to increase (Hao et al.,20o1;Yao et al.,2013),decrease (Mutegi et al.,2010;Abalos et al., 2013; Jin et al.,2014),or remain unaffected (Shan & Yan, 2013)due to crop residue removal. This emphasizes the uncertainty in predicting how crop residue removal influences $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions;clear information is required because $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ depletes the ozone layer (Ravishankara et al.,20o9) and is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 298 times higher than $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ per mass (IPCC，2007).Agriculture represents the largest source of anthropogenic $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions,primarily attributed to field cropping (Montzka et al.，2011; Reay et al.，2012). Asagriculture is expected to expand and intensify for food and biofuel production，particularly in mid-latitude and cold climates (IPCC,2014),it is imperative that research characterizes in detail the influence of crop residue management on $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions.

Despite these seemingly harsh conditions, $3 9 - 9 0 \\%$ of annual $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions can occur overwinter (van Bochove et al., 2000;Teepe et al.,200o; Jayasundara et al.，2007;Yanai et al.,2011; Abalos et al., 2015). Upon soil thawing, the physical release of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ trapped under ice cover or at depth in unfrozen soils has been often considered as the primary mechanism of overwinter $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ flux (Bremner et al.，1980;Burton & Beauchamp，1994;Teepe et al., 2001;Koponen et al.， 2004)，due to the long-standing assumption that microbes are inactive overwinter due to low soil temperatures.Yet，recent studies have demonstrated evidence for de novo denitrification as the primary mechanism for $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions overwinter and during spring thaw (Wagner-Riddle et al.,2oo8;Németh et al.，2014)，emphasizing the importance of microbiological processes at low temperatures.Evidence for active (or even peak) microbial biomass and respiration overwinter in cold regions has indeed been documented (Brooks et al.,1996,2005;Schimel et al.,2004),but these studies were focused on arctic or subarctic ecosystems and very little is known for overwinter microbial activity in mid-latitude agroecosystems.Recent research by Németh et al. (2014) has characterized changes in soil microbial communities overwinter in contrasting tillage and residue management cropping systems and demonstrated that changes in $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ flux were correlated with changes in bacterial nitrifier/denitrifier gene community composition. Because crop residue removal influences the soil heterotrophic community (Németh et al., 2014),it also likely impacts $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ dynamics,but more research is needed to characterize the effect.No studies have been conducted overwinter and over multiple seasons to fully characterize the influence of crop residue removal on $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions.

No-till can increase $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions by reducing soil aeration, increasing soil C and N,and soil moisture within the surface layers,leading to higher denitrification rates compared with tilled soils (Rochette，2008)； alternatively,no-till can improve soil structure,lower soil temperature,and reduce $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ loss (Six et al.,2002; Venterea et al.,2011). Consequently,some studies have found no difference orlower $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions from soils under notill vs.conventional tillage (Parkin & Kaspar, 2006; Gregorich et al.,2008;Rochette,2008;Rochette et al.,2008) while others have found higher $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions with notill (Ball et al., 1999; Chatskikh & Olesen,2007).At Elora, Ontario，Wagner-Riddle et al.(20o7） found that best management practices (including no-tillage） lowered $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions compared to conventional practices,but the comparison of no-till to conventional tillage was confounded by the use of reduced fertilizer rates in the best management treatment. These above-mentioned studies and the review by van Kessel et al. (2013) have demonstrated that $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions relate to the interaction of no-till management with factors such as soil properties,climate,and N fertilizer applications,but it is not clear how $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions are affected when crop residue is removed from no-till vs. conventional systems.

Further, shifts in microbial denitrifier/nitrifier communities have been observed over time and between frozen and unfrozen soil conditions(Wertz et al., 2013).

With CT vs.NT and with $\\mathrm { R - }$ vs. $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { R + } }$ in our experiment, decomposers might have had a relatively lower capacity to process crop residue into more soluble C compounds (i.e., transform crop residue-C and produce microbialderived C) overwinter because of (1） the greater extent of soil freezing with CT vs.NT,and (2) less C input with $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { R - } }$ vs. $\\mathbb { R } ^ { + }$ ，Consequently，NT and $\\mathbb { R } ^ { + }$ practices could have resulted in more labile soil C (i.e.，DOC; Fig. 7) overwinter which facilitated more complete stepwisedenitrificationduringanaerobicconditions (thereby reducing $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ emissions） compared to CT or $\\mathrm { R - }$ practices.In support of this mechanism，Németh et al.(2014) found that $\\mathbb { R } ^ { + }$ and $\\mathrm { R - }$ treatments did not differ in nitrite reductase (nirS) gene quantities; however,the nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene quantities were greater with $\\mathbb { R } ^ { + }$ than $\\mathrm { R } -$ .Thus，Németh et al.

Similarly,the addition of labile C sources to soil reduced emissions of NO and $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ (Sänchez-Martin et al.，2008). The nirS and nosZ communities may respond differently to organic C amendments,as the addition of plant residues had no significant impact on nirS-bearing denitrifiersbut increased the abundance of nosZ-bearing denitrifiers (Henderson et al.,2010).
