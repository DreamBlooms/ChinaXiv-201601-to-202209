        "text": "AbstractTooth reduction and loss was an important evolutionary process in Mesozoic birds. Analysis of evolutionary trends in the total mass of the dentition,a function of tooth size and tooth number, has the potential to shed light on the evolutionary pattern of tooth reduction and loss, and on the causes of this pattern.Because modern birds lack teeth,however, they cannot provide the basis for a model that would allow estimation of tooth masses in their Mesozoic counterparts. We selected the teeth of crocodilians as analogues of those in Mesozoic birds because the former are the closest living relatives of the later,and the two groups are similar in tooth morphology, tooth implantation,and tooth replacement pattern.To estimate tooth masses in Mesozoic birds, we formulated four regression equations relating tooth mass to various linear dimensions,which were measured in 31 intact isolated teeth from eight individual crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis).The results for Mesozoic birds show that dental mass as a proportion of body mass was negligible,at least from the perspective of flight performance, suggesting that selection pressure favoring body mass reduction was probably not the primary driver of tooth reduction or loss. Variations in dental mass among Mesozoic birds may reflect the different foods they ate,and the different types of feeding behavior they displayed. ",

        "text": "Tooth loss in Mesozoic birds has traditionally been regarded as a phenomenon driven at least in part by the need to improve flight performance by reducing the mass of the body, and particularly of body parts situated far from the center of gravity (Dilger,1957; Proctor and Lynch,1998; Feduccia,1999; Zhou et al., 2009; Louchart and Viriot, 2011).However, some recent studies (Zheng et al., 2011, 2014a) have linked tooth loss to dietary changes,and evodevo results even demonstrated the tooth reduction seen in early birds was correlated with the evolutionary origin of beaks (Wang et al., 2O17), implying that the mass reduction hypothesis requires critical reevaluation.Tooth loss occurred independently in several early avian lineages (Zhou and Zhang,2006; Zhou et al.,2009; Davit-BÃ©al et al.,2009),suggesting that reduction and eventual disappearance of the dentition might have conferred some broadly applicable selective advantage.Among toothed Mesozoic birds, the teeth vary widely in both number and size, indicating that tooth reduction was a gradual and not necessarily monotonic process. For example, Hesperornis had up to 47 teeth in the mouth (Marsh,1880; Gregory,1951),whereas Jeholornis palmapenis may have had only one or two maxillary teeth on either side of the skull (O'Connor et al, 2012). The crown height of the teeth is $1 . 2 \\mathrm { - } 1 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ in Archaeopteryx (London specimen, humerus length: $7 4 . 6 \\mathrm { m m }$ ; Wellnhofer, 2009),but only about $0 . 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ in the admittedly smaller Longirostravis (humerus length: $2 4 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ ; Hou et al.,2004). However, the pattern of variation in tooth size and number across individual Mesozoic bird species has never been examined in detail. ",

This study aims to estimate the relative mass of the dentition in a range of Mesozoic birds, including representatives of key avian clades,in order to both assess the degree to which the dentition contributed to body mass across early birds in general and evaluate patterns of variation in relative dental mass within Aves. The results will shed light on the plausibility of the two underlying assumptions of the hypothesis that tooth loss in birds was driven primarily by selection for reduced body mass, namely that the teeth of the basalmost birds were massive enough to afect flight performance and that tooth mass was gradually reduced in proportional terms as flight capability improved.4 To the best of our knowledge,the analysis described here is the first to use empirically-derived estimates of the total mass of the dentition in a range of Mesozoic birds to explore the issue of tooth reduction.

Given this constraint, the ideal approach would perhaps be to use the volume of a fossil tooth, combined with data on tooth density from modern vertebrates,as a basis for estimating the tooth's original mass in the living animal. This would be possible for complete, isolated teeth,but in the case of slab specimens would require that the dentition (including the tooth roots) be either excavated out of the jaws and surrounding matrix by a preparator or imaged three-dimensionally using a technique such as $\\mu { }$ CT scanning.

Measurements taken included crown height (CH), tooth height (TH), fore-aft-crown-length (FACL), fore-aftbasal-length (FABL) and fore-aft-root-length (FARL) (Fig. 1). The positions of the individual teeth within the dentitions of the eight individuals are unknown, because the teeth were ones that had dropped out of the jaws as the crocodile skeletons were shipped to the IVPP from a crocodile farm in Fujian Province, China. However, the teeth did not include any of the enlarged fangs that occur near the front of the mouth in crocodilians. The skeletons were individually packaged, making it possible to determine which teeth came from each individual in the sample. Because of hybridization practices in the crocodile farming industry, it is possible that the specimens are not pure C. siamensis but rather contain some genetic input from the salt-water crocodile (C. porosus) and/or other Crocodylus species.In the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), the tooth crowns tend to become more robust during ontogeny (Erickson et al., 2003), and similar changes may occur at least to some degree in Crocodylus. For this reason, the immature Crocodylus teeth used in this study probably represent better analogues for Mesozoic bird teeth, which are relatively slender, than would the teeth of older Crocodylus individuals.

When experimentally offered mice, shrike with an average body mass of 48 g were able to transport mice averaging $ { 1 8 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ } }$ in mass an average distance of $6 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ using the beak, and were able to transport mice averaging $4 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ an average of $3 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ using the pedal claws.

It is particularly notable that the shrikes were able to fly for tens of meters while carrying large prey items in their beaks,as this undermines otherwise plausible arguments that selection strongly favored dental reduction because the position of the teeth far anterior to the center of gravity caused them to exert a large, destabilizing torque during flight (Zhou et al., 2009).

Although we are unaware of any compelling evidence that any Mesozoic birds engaged in aerial migrations, the ability of some modern species to do so while carrying vast reserves of body fat suggests that the mass of the dentition would have had only a trivial effect on performance and the energetic cost of transport even if Mesozoic birds sometimes flew for considerable distances.

If gizzard stones are in some sense a functional replacement for teeth, the change from dental to gastricl trituration has increased rather than reduced the mass of the body and its contents,although it has admittedly also concentrated the body's mass closer to the center of gravity. The Mesozoic birds Sapeornis (Zhou and Zhang, 2003; Zheng et al.,2011), Bohaiornis (Li et al.,2014) and Yanornis (Zhou et al., 2004) in fact possess both gizzard stones and teeth,and it is striking that the non-ornithothoracine Sapeornis in particular could apparently fly adequately with both types of triturating apparatus in place despite lacking the ossified sternum and elongate coracoid (Zheng et al., 2O14b) seen in more aerially capable avians. While some other nonornithothoracine birds do possess an ossified sternum and elongate coracoid, a number of additional derived, apparently flight-related features are restricted to ornithothoracines, including a triosseal canal and a well-developed sternal keel (Brusatte et al.,2O15). Mesozoic ornithuromorphs and to some degree enantiornithines may have broadly resembled typical extant birds in their mode of flight, but non-ornithothoracine birds including Sapeornis were clearly less well adapted to aerial locomotion. It is possible,and indeed likely, that nonornithothoracine birds were somewhat more easily impaired by loads than their modern counterparts. Nevertheless, the occurrence of both gastroliths and teeth in Sapeornis,a nonornithothoracine bird that was probably a particularly weak flier, suggests that the mass of the triturating apparatus was not a major target of selection pressure even in birds of this grade. More broadly, the impressive load-carrying capabilities of extant birds strongly imply that a dentition making up no more than $\\sim 1 \\text{â°}$ of body mass would not have significantly encumbered even non-ornithothoracines,despite their lower level of aerial adaptation.

However, a modified form of the mass reduction hypothesis may still be viable, given that the presence of teeth requires the tooth-bearing bones to be deep enough to enclose tooth roots. Despite the small mass of the dentition itself, it is possible that flight-related lightening of the head, not the teeth per se,favored reduction of the premaxilla, maxilla and dentary to the point where retention of teth was no longer feasible.
