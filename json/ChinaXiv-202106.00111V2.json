We use abstract business model as a measure to cut the line between the two type of systems because in concrete domain the boundary tends to be obscured and difficult to divide them: even systems with its business model completely inside the sandbox has various components off chain like user-interaction or some other peripheral parts，and from an abstract view they are supportive instead of core components and can be abstracted away. or,in languages that is more sophistical they are more being of representation character that is some representation of the essence expressed by the business model. This methodology makes things much clearer though we still cannot give technically precise delineation of the blockchain-partial and blockchain-complete systems.Defi organizations (MakerDao,Compound） are typical blockchain-complete systems because all its core transactions are on-chain，there is no off-chain business process to handle its functions like borrowing,lending or mortgage as n real world financial intermediaries,their business model is closed on-chain, they are blockchain-complete.A supply-chain system that utilizes blockchain as a ledger to store hashes for some key data is blockchain-partial for the main body of its transactions and data still exists in relational databases or some cloud storage.The boundary is quite clear.
