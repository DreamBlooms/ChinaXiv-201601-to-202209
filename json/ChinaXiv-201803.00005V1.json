        "text": "Abstract: In developing countries such as Ethiopia, research to develop and promote soil and water conservation practices rarely addressed regional diversity. Using a water-balance approach in this study, we used runoff plots from three sites, each representing a different agro-ecological environment, e.g.,high, mid and low in both elevation and rainfall,in the Upper Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia to examine the runoff response and runoff conservation eficiency of a range of diferent soil and water conservation measures and their impacts on soil moisture. The plots at each site represented common land use types (cultivated vs. non-agricultural land use types) and slopes (gentle and steep). Seasonal runoff from control plots in the highlands ranged 214-560 versus $2 5 3 { - } 4 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ at midlands and $1 1 9 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ at lowlands. The three soil and water conservation techniques applied in cultivated land increased runoff conservation eficiency by $32 \\%$ to $51 \\%$ , depending on the site. At the moist subtropical site in a highland region, soil and water conservation increased soil moisture enough to potentially cause waterlogging, which was absent at the lowrainfall sites. Soil bunds combined with Vetiveria zizanioides grass in cultivated land and short trenches in grassland conserved the most runoff $51 \\%$ and $5 5 \\%$ ,respectively). Runoff responses showed high spatial variation within and between land use types,causing high variation in soil and water conservation efficiency. Our results highlight the need to understand the role of the agro-ecological environment in the success of soil and water conservation measures to control runoff and hydrological dynamics. This understanding wil support policy development to promote the adoption of suitable techniques that can be tested at other locations with similar soil, climatic, and topographic conditions. ",

Some of the major physical soil and water conservation techniques being used in the country include short trenches, soil and stone bunds, cut-off drains, check dams, hillside terraces, area closures,Fanya juu (a Swahili word meaning 'throw uphill'), and Zai pits (a term in Burkina Faso used to refer digging pits that retain compost and direct water into the soil surrounding each plants to grow). Recently, physical structures have been combined with biological measures such as vegetation establishment to protect the soil against erosion (Amare et al., 2O14). But despite these efforts, the sustainability of the development work is unclear. Due to low rates of adoption, most of the promoted practices have been only partially successful. In some cases, disadoption or reduced use of the techniques has been reported (Tadesse and Belay, 2004). ",

(2017) found that the impact of these interventions was influenced by both the type of measurement and the agroecosystem under which it was implemented. Landscape, land use, soils, hydrological processes, and climate can be highly variable across regions, and their linkages to the success of environmental management practices are important aspects that must be understood and documented (Melesse and Abtew,2016). In addition,Bayabil etal. (2O1O) illustrated that the effectiveness of a soil and water conservation practice depends on whether watershed runoff processes depend primarily on the local ecosystem, topography, or a combination of the two. The suitability of any soil and water management practice depends greatly upon the soil, topography, climate, cropping system, and resources available to farmers (Pathak et al., 2OO9). Overall an agro-ecological approach can contribute substantially to sustainable intensification of agriculture, but this must supported by an improved knowledge of the optimal conservation measure for each combination of site type and land use (Lampkin et al., 2015).

Bekele-Tesemma et al. (2O05) suggested that temperature (which is determined by the altitude) and rainfall are the two most important climatic factors that afect land management from the point of view of farmers or development agents. Hurni et al. (2O16) developed general soil and water conservation guidelines in which they noted that climate varies greatly within Ethiopia, which ranges from dry to wet, and covers a range of elevations from lowlands to highlands. As a result, it is not possible to apply the same soil and water conservation techniques everywhere. This conclusion was based on a feasibility study of different physical conservation measures that had been tested in micro-watersheds (soil conservation research sites) in different agro-ecology systems that had been monitored 25 years ago (Herweg and Ludi, 1999).

Studies on the efficiency of soil and water conservation are few, and most concentrated on the combination of a single agro-ecology with a specific conservation measure (Taye et al., 2013; Adimassu et al., 2014; Amare et al., 2014; Dagnew et al., 2015; Fenta et al., 2017b; Sultan et al.,2017). However,these studies also lack detailed information about the hydrological dynamics created by the conservation efforts across a range of land use, cover types, and slope classes. Best management practice should encompass a series of measures that are useful, proven to be effective, cost-effective, and generally accepted among conservation experts and the ultimate users for specific agro-ecology systems. Hence, critical analysis of the runoff responses and efficiency of the available measures under different agro-ecology systems is needed to evaluate which particular sustainable land management interventions are most likely to be successful in a given location. This suggests a need for analyses that examine the interactions between various location-specific factors. The results of such observations will provide greater insight into how soil and water conservation affects the hydrological processes under different agroecology systems. To provide some of the missing knowledge， we used plot-level runoff measurements and hydrological analyses at three different agro-ecological sites in the Amhara and Benishangul Gumuz administrative regions of Ethiopia. Our objectives were (1) to analyze the spatial variability of rainfall-runoff relationship and its controlling factors and (2) to determine the ability of different soil and water conservation practices to reduce runoff and improve soil moisture availability in typical agro-ecology systems in the Upper Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia.

The seasonal runoff from control plots in the Guder watershed ranged from 214 to $5 6 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ ,versus 253 to $4 7 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ at Aba Gerima and 119 to $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ at Debatie.

The cumulative runoff was the lowest at Debatie, which was the site with by far the lowest precipitation. Changes in precipitation regimes clearly have the potential to profoundly affect runof and soil erosion. Lee et al. (1996) confirmed that the precipitation had a linear relationship with runoff and soil erosion, with little difference in runoff response to a change in storm frequency or intensity. The grazing land site on a steep slope (GR2) generated the highest seasonal runoff at Guder $( 5 6 0 \\mathrm { m m } )$ ,followed bythe same site type at Aba Gerima $( 4 7 5 \\mathrm { m m } )$ andDebatie $( 1 3 4 \\mathrm { m m } )$ ; the high runoff in Guder might be related to frequent trampling by animals because the site was used for grazing livestock.

This can be explained, on the one hand,by the direct effect of raindrop interception by the vegetation canopy， which dissipates their energy and creates infiltration pathways (Morgan et al., 1986; Castillo et al.,1997; Descroix et al.,2001). On the other hand, vegetation decreases runoff indirectly by improving soil physical properties through the incorporation of organic matter ( $1 6 . 7 \\%$ in Guder; Sultan et al., 2O17) and loosening of the soil by growing roots, thereby increasing the infiltration rate (Descheemaeker et al., 2O06). Taye et al. (2013)explained this in a different way; they reported that RC decreased with increasing slope due to an increase in the content of coarse particles in the soil, which promoted infiltration. Similarly, Tebebu et al. (2O15) illustrated that, for saturation-excess runoff, water infiltrates on hilsides and erosion-inducing runoff occurs in the flatter, downslope parts of landscapes. This, in turn, affects the hydrology, since excess water flows more rapidly to valley bottoms as lateral flow, leading to gully formation (Bayabil et al., 2O1O).

The threshold rainfall can be determined by ploting the daily runoff depth against the corresponding rainfall depth (Fig. 4) and performing least-squares regression (Descheemaeker et al., 2006; Girmay et al., 2009). The slope of the regression line represents how rapidly runoff depth increases with increasing rainfall depth after the rainfall threshold is exceeded. The threshold rainfall values were selected based on the probability of $80 \\%$ of events below the threshold level rainfall failing to produce runoff. The higher the rainfall threshold and the lower the slope of the curve,the higher the infiltration rate and greater the storage capacity of the soil in the agro-ecology system (Descheemaeker et al., 20O6; Girmay et al., 2009).

The slope of the rainfallrunoff curve also varied widely among the plots; with the values of 0.1O-0.45. The soil and water conservation practices using vegetated soil bunds and short trenches in the cultivated and grazing land plots resulted in a lower slope of the curve than in the corresponding control plots at all three sites (Table 4).

In addition, the heavy soils of the Guder watershed (Table 1) tend to retain moisture for a longer period,and this can lower the threshold rainfall compared with other sites.

On average, the establishment of soil and water conservation measures decreased runoff by $3 5 \\%$ ， $41 \\%$ ,and $42 \\%$ at the Guder, Debatie, and Aba Gerima sites, respectively. ",

The seasonal potential evapotranspiration values were 579, 675, and $7 3 2 \\mathrm { m m }$ for the Guder, Dibatie, and Aba Gerima sites, respectively, which were determined by the Hargreaves and Samani (1985) equation.

The differences in these ranges can be attributed to differences in the frequency of rainfall(amount), soil type,runoff amount (Table 3), and potential evaporation among the diferent agro-ecology systems. On average, implementation of soil and water conservation measures increased seasonal water availability by about $1 3 9 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ compared with the control plot at the Guder site,versus 13O and $6 7 \\mathrm { m m }$ at theAba Gerima and Debatie sites, respectively (Fig. 6).

This decreased the conservation efficiency of the various soil and water conservation practices (Table 3). Consequently, the role of management practices was more important. It is more necessary to choose and design the optimal structure for these sites, i.e., where there is more runoff, there is more sediment transport capacity. Hence to control erosion and ofsite transport of sediment, soil and water conservation planers need to focus on the safely disposal of the runoff to avoid risk of crop damage due to flooding or increase opportunities for sediment deposition from overland flow. This understanding helps to balance the soil erosion effect against the moisture retention/shedding effects of different measures. ",

These results can guide managers towards the optimal choice of soil and water conservation measures under specific site conditions. Our study revealed that the responses of runoff and runoff conservation efficiency to soil and water conservation practices were highly variable both within and between agro-ecology systems. This high variation could be attributed to a combination of several factors such as the type of soil (permeability),land use types, soil water availability, the response of runof to rainfall, and the prevailing climatic conditions (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration). These practices were highly efective in controlling runoff in the humid subtropical (Moist Weyna Dega) and tropical hot humid (Moist Kolla) agro-ecology systems, with average runoff reductions of $42 \\%$ and $41 \\%$ , respectively. The moist subtropical region (Guder) had a higher potential soil moisture availability, but a lower rainfall threshold to generate runoff. From these findings, implementation of short trenches (humid subtropical) in grazing land maximized the efficiency in conserving runoff $( 5 5 \\% )$ due to temporary water storage in the short trenches,followed by infiltration. In contrast, vegetated bunds would be most effective in cultivated land, and short trenches would be effective in the two plantation types. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying each combination of agro-ecology system, site, and climate to scientifically determine the optimal conservation measures for that combination instead of making blanket recommendations for all systems that are likely to provide suboptimal results for many combinations. This understanding and the present results will help managers to choose the most effective conservation measures based on field trials and to test whether they wil be equally applicable at other locations with similar soil, climatic, and topographic conditions.
