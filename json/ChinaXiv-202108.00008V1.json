        "text": "Abstract: Nitrogen $( \\mathrm { N } )$ addition has profound impacts on litter-mediated nutrient cycling. Numerous studies have reported diferent effects of N addition on liter decomposition, exhibiting positive, negative, or neutral effects. Previous meta-analysis of litter decomposition under N addition was mainly based on a small number of samples to allow comparisons among ecosystem types.This study presents the results of a meta-analysis incorporating data from 53 published studies (including 617 observations) across forests, graslands,wetlands,and croplands in China, to investigate how environmental and experimental factors impact the effects of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition on litter decomposition.Averaged across all of the studies,N addition significantly slows litter decomposition by $7 . 0 2 \\%$ . Considering ecosystem types,N addition significantly accelerates litter decomposition by $3 . 7 0 \\%$ and $1 1 . 2 2 \\%$ in grasslands and wetlands, respectively, clearly inhibits litter decomposition by $1 4 . 5 3 \\%$ in forests,and has no significant effects on litter decomposition in croplands. Regarding the accelerated litter decomposition rate in grasslands due to $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition， litter decomposition rate increases slightly with increasing rates of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition. However, $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition slows litter decomposition in forests，but litter decomposition is at a significantly increasing rate with increasing amounts of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition. The responses of litter decomposition to $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition are also influenced by the forms of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition, experiential duration of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition,humidity index, litter quality, and soil $\\mathrm { \\Delta p H }$ .In summary, $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition alters liter decomposition rate,but the direction and magnitude of the response are affected by the forms of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition,the rate of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition,ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition, experimental duration, and climate factors. Our study highlights the contrasting effects of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition on litter decomposition in forests and grasslands.This finding could be used in biogeochemical models to better evaluate ecosystem carbon cycling under increasing $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition due to the differential responses of litter decomposition to $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition rates and ecosystem types.

Increases in N deposition have been shown to significantly influence litter quality and the availability of soil nutrients (Hou et al.,2O2O). These changes have profound effects on litter decomposition rate,and have been shown in forests (Hobbie, 20o8; Zhang et al. 2016), grassands (Alster et al.,2013),wetlands (Song et al., 2018),and croplands (Zhou et al., 2018). However, the detailed results of increasing N deposition are highly inconsistent. For example, N addition significantly increased (Schuster, 2015)， decreased (Freedman et al.， 2016)，or even showed no detectable effect on liter decomposition rate (Zhang et al.， 2O18） in particular circumstances. The variations in these results may be due to diferences in ecosystem type, the rates of N addition, and litter quality. ",

For example, low or high levels of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition significantly inhibited litter decomposition rate,while moderate levels of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition significantly accelerated it. However, another study reported that low levels of N addition $( < 6 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ N / ( m } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { a } ) )$ significantly stimulated litter decomposition, while moderate $\\left( 6 - 1 2 \\ \\mathrm { g } \\right.$ $\\bf { N } / ( \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { a } ) )$ or high $( > 1 2 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ N ~ } / ( \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { a } ) )$ levels of N addition clearly inhibited litter decomposition (Chen et al., 2015). To our knowledge, there are still very few studies which have quantified and predicted litter decomposition rate in response to $\\mathrm { ~ N ~ }$ addition. Owing to the complexity and spatial heterogeneity of ecological interactions,it is difficult forany individual study to effectively resolve these differences; a general examination of the tendencies and pattrns of the effects of N addition on litter decomposition would be a useful exercise.

        "text": "At least two previous meta-analytical studies have been performed to evaluate the general effect of N addition on litter decomposition (Knorr et al.,2005; Zhang et al.,2018). Specifically, Knorr et al. (2005) selected 24 studies solely from North America and Europe before 20o0 taken as a whole, but their sample size was insufficient to consider the impacts of the rate of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition on litter decomposition in different ecosystem types. Zhang et al. (2018) also investigated the impacts of N addition on litter C cycling and nutrient release. Unfortunately, these studies are limited by their sample sizes. Knorr et al. (2oo5） attempted to assess how the various factors (differences in ecosystem types,climatic factors,the rates and forms of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition,and ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition) interact with N addition to afect liter decomposition. In addition, some studies found that N addition had different effects on litter decomposition in the various stages of decomposition (Hobbie et al.，2012; Johansson et al.，2012； Zhang and Wang,2012； Zhang et al., 2014).For example, N addition could promote litter decomposition in the initial stages but reduce it in the latter stages, indicating that the timing of liter decomposition rate determination was also a key factor influencing the results of an investigation. The diferent hypotheses generated by these studies may be due to the differences in the ecosystem types, the rates of N addition,the forms of N addition, the duration of N application, the amount of ambient N deposition,and the variables of soil and climate (Knorr et al., 2005; Aerts, 2006; Dong et al., 2020). The interactions between N addition and these factors as well as their effects on liter decomposition rate still merit additional study,since this subject is of great significance in accurately predicting the future impact of global climate change on litter decomposition.

Previous studies have shown substantial variations in the effects of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition on litter decomposition and have reported positive (Liu et al.， 2010; Hou et al.， 202O), negative (Liu et al., 2010),and neutral (Hobbie,20o05,2008) effects.N addition can influence litter decomposition through a number of mechanisms (Hobbie et al.,2012). In recent years,two opposing hypotheses have been suggested to account for the effects of N addition on litter decomposition,seen from the viewpoint of litter quality. The first hypothesis is applicable to N-limited ecosystems, in which microorganisms are more able to degrade lignin to obtain sources of N. The second hypothesis concerns N-saturated ecosystems,where microorganisms can easily obtain $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ from sources other than lignin (Hobbie, 2008; He et al., 2019). ",

The negative effects of enhanced soil $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ on soil microbes can outweigh the positive effects of higher litter quality (increased litter $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ content and decreased C:N ratio)，and finally inhibit litter decomposition (Liu et al., 201O). In forest ecosystems, $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition contributes to soil acidification (Yang et al.，2015） and decreases the soil base cations $( \\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ ， $\\mathrm { { N a } ^ { + } }$ ， $\\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } }$ ，and $\\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + \\cdot }$ ). These macronutrients can significantly increase litter decomposition rate (Vivanco and Austin,2019; Zhou et al., 2O2O). Furthermore,N addition significantly reduces the activity of lignin-degrading enzymes，thus inhibiting litter decomposition (Hobbie et al.，2012). In contrast, in grassland ecosystems,the degradation of lignin is limited by the availability of soil N. N addition significantly increases the availability of soil N, enhances the concentrations of plant $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and P, and decreases plant lignin and cellulose contents. The positive eects of improved litter quality significantly increase litter decomposition rate (Liu et al., 2010; Hou et al., 202O). Although $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition reduces microbial activity and changes the composition of soil microbial community (Liu et al.,2014),the stimulatory efects of improved liter quality exceed the unfavorable influence of increased soil $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ and promote litter decomposition (Liu et al., 2010).

In grassland ecosystems,litter decomposition rate tends to increase with the rate of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition, and at a significantly increasing rate with increasing amounts of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition.This result is inconsistent with the finding of previous reports, that is,at low or high rate of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition $_ { ( < 7 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { g } }$ $\\mathrm { { N / } } ( \\mathrm { { m } } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { { a } } )$ or $> 1 2 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { g } \\ \\mathrm { N } / ( \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { a } )$ ,respectively), litter decomposition is significantly slowed, while at moderate rates of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition $( 7 . 5 { - } 1 2 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { g } \\ \\mathrm { N } / ( \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { a } ) )$ , litter decomposition is significantly enhanced (Knorr et al.， 2Oo5).

Numerous previous studies have indicated a nonlinear response and threshold to the rate of N addition in terrestrial ecosystems (Bai et al.,2010; Tian et al.,2016; Hou et al.,2020). Our study showed that N addition or ambient N deposition both slow litter decomposition rate,and that the change in litter decomposition rate increases significantly with increasing rates of both $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition and ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition. Unfortunately,our study was also limited by a paucity of information on the various differences in liter composition, so more field experimental evidence is required to determine whether there is a nonlinear response and threshold for litter decomposition in respect to N addition.

A study by Zhang et al. (2014) also reported that the type of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition significantly affects litter decomposition, supporting our results. It is worth noting that all of the data on the use of mixtures of N addition in this study were derived from the study of Dong et al. (2020) on the meadow steppes of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, involving five grassland species and the liter produced by the entire plant community. Hobbie (2000） reported that mixed $\\mathrm { ~  ~ N ~ }$ addition in the field experiments significantly promotes the decomposition of Metrosideros polymorpha liter. Such studies provide direct evidence that the effects of mixed forms of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition on litter decomposition rate can differ from those of N fertilization alone,and that the various $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ fertilizer types can significantly influence litter decomposition rates in different ways. Consequently， global carbon emissions from litter decomposition may be underestimated if based only on results from experiments in which single-source N fertilizers are added (Christopher et al.,2012). Our results highlight the increased effects of mixed forms of N addition on litter decomposition compared with a pure $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ fertilizer. A study by Dong et al.

Considering natural atmospheric $\\mathrm { ~ N ~ }$ deposition,which includes both inorganic and organic N (Zhang and Wang, 2O12), we suggest that future research should pay more attention to the effects of mixed-N addition on litter decomposition.

This may be due to an increase in litter quality at low rate of ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition,while high rate of ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition significantly decreases soil microbial activity, changing soil microbial composition, thus resulting in a negative impact on liter decomposition rate (Alison et al., 2Oo9). N addition significantly increases litter decomposition when the rate of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition is 1O-fold greater than the rate of ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition, but $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition significantly inhibits litter decomposition when the rate of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition is 10-fold lower than the rate of ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition. Our results imply that the effects of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition on litter decomposition are regulated by ambient $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ deposition and the ratio of the rate of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition to ambient N deposition. The degree of the effects of N addition on liter decomposition could also be affected by experimental duration, litter quality, soil $\\mathfrak { p H }$ ，and HI. Litter decomposition rate is significantly increased over periods of less than 6 months and significantly reduced over a 6-12 months period, while there is no significant effect over a period of more than 13 months. Some previous studies have shown that experimental duration has a significant impact on the effects of N addition on litter decomposition rate, and that liter decomposition rate is promoted during the early stages and inhibited during the latter stages of the experiment (Hobbie et al., 2O12; Zhang et al., 2014), indicating that the forms of N addition and experimental duration are important in regulating the process of litter decomposition. Some studies have also found that unstable litter C components rapidly decompose in the early stages owing to the high activity of degrading enzymes,and that litter lignin accumulates during the latter stages due to reductions in lignin-degrading enzyme activity and changes in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Zak et al., 2Oo8; Hobbie et al., 2012; Zhang and Wang, 2012),which, to some degree, also explains why $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition accelerates litter decomposition in the early stages of an experiment but slows liter decomposition in the latter stages.

In our study, we found a significant linear correlation between AMT and MAP( $_ { ( P < 0 . 0 0 1 }$ ； Fig.S1). Therefore,we used HI as a climatic index to evaluate the relationship between litter decomposition rate and climatic factors, dividing HI into three groups: O-30,3O-60,and ${ > } 6 0$ . While HI is an important influencing factor, there are no significant differences among these groups. Linear regression analyses ilustrate that the lnRR of liter decomposition rate significantly decreases with increasing MAP and AMT, which is partially consistent with previous meta-analysis studies (Knorr et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2018). As a result, climate can be a crucial factor regulating the effects of N addition on litter decomposition. Based on the results of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition field experiments under different conditions in China,we explored the general contribution of $\\mathrm { \\Delta N }$ addition to the factors regulating litter decomposition rate.
