        "text": "Abstract: River runoff plays an important role in watershed ecosystems and human survival, and it is controlled by multiple environmental factors. However, the synergistic effects of various largescale circulation factors and meteorological factors on the runoff on different time-frequency scales have rarely been explored.In light of this,the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effects of the diferent environmental factors on the runoff variations was investigated in the Yellow River Basin of China during the period 1950-2019 using the bivariate wavelet coherence (WTC） and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC） methods.First， the continuous wavelet transform (CWT） method was used to analyze the multiscale characteristics of the runoff.The results of the CWT indicate that the runoff exhibited significant continuous or discontinuous annual and semiannual oscilations during the study period. Scattered inter-annual time scales were also observed for the runoff in the Yellow River Basin. The meteorological factors better explained the runoff variations on seasonal and annual time scales. The average wavelet coherence (AWC) and the percent area of the significant coherence (PASC) between the runoff and individual meteorological factors were O.454 and $1 9 . 8 9 \\%$ ，respectively. The circulation factors mainly regulated the runoff on the inter-annual and decadal time scales with more complicated phase relationships due to their indirect effects on the runof The AWC and PASC between the runoff and individual circulation factors were 0.359 and $7 . 3 1 \\%$ ， respectively. The MWC analysis revealed that the synergistic effects of multiple factors should be taken into consideration to explain the multiscale characteristic variations of the runoff. The AWC or MWC ranges were 0.320-0.560, 0.617-0.755,and 0.819-0.884 for the combinations ofone， two，and three circulation and meteorological factors， respectively. The PASC ranges were $3 . 5 3 \\% - 3 3 . 7 7 \\%$ ， $1 2 . 9 3 \\% - 3 6 . 9 0 \\%$ ，and $2 0 . 6 7 \\% - 3 9 . 3 4 \\%$ for the combinations one, two,and three driving factors，respectively. The combinations of precipitation， evapotranspiration (or the number of rainy days),and the Arctic Oscilation performed well in explaining the variability in the runoff on all time scales, and the average MWC and PASC were O.847 and $28 . 7 9 \\%$ ，respectively. These findings are of great significance for improving our understanding of hydro-climate interactions and Water resources prediction in the Yellow River Basin. ",

The streamflow is determined by multiple driving factors， mainly including meteorological factors(e.g.， precipitation， temperature, and evapotranspiration), large-scale global atmospheric circulation factors (e.g., the Arctic Oscilation (AO)，North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)，Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)，and El Nino-Southern Oscilation (ENSO))，and human activities. The responses of the runoff to different factors vary on different time scales (Labat, 2Oo8; Su et al.,2017). Precipitation plays a dominant role in the long-term trend and inter-annual variability of the global runoff (Piao et al., 2007; Gerten et al., 2O08). Furthermore,precipitation trends have been found to be spatially consistent with streamflow trends in observations (Xu et al., 2010), climate model simulations (Yang et al.,2019; Wu et al.,2020),and land surface models (Piao et al., 2007) in most regions. Evapotranspiration also plays a major role in controling the evolution and cycling of the runoff (Wine and Zou,2012; Huo et al.,202O). The rising temperature will not only lead to an increase in evapotranspiration, but also accelerate the melting of ice and snow (Niedzielski et al.,2019; Notarnicola, 2O20). Moreover, after the permafrost melting caused by the increase in temperature, the infiltration capacity of the soil will be enhanced, which will result in complex changes in the runoff (Li et al., 2012).

These studies have also reported that the response relationships between the runoff and various climate variables exhibit significant asymmetrical characteristics and nonlinear variations.For example, Shen et al. (2Ol7) evaluated the impacts of various climatic factors on the runoff changes in 224 catchments in China based on a Budyko-type equation, and found that the precipitation depth can explain the runoff increase better in almost every basin. Chen et al. (2O19） studied the regional asymmetric effect of the daily extreme temperature on the runoff variations in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) of China using the variable infiltration capacity model, and their results showed that the relationships between the runoff and both the highest and lowest temperature are upward parabolic functions. Chu et al. (2019) investigated the correlations and lag or lead times between the runoff and climate variables (precipitation， temperature，and evapotranspiration） through cross-correlation functions and wavelet coherence in the source area of the YRB,and their results revealed that the runoff is mainly controlled by precipitation and temperature on various timescales with certain time lags. Consequently,analyses of the effects of different meteorological factors on the nonlinear behavior and multiscale characteristics of the runoff must consider the combined influence of multiple complex driving factors. However, the aforementioned studies and most previous studies have mainly focused on the individual effects of single factors and cannot fully reflect the synergistic effects of multiple factors on the runoff variations.

Fluctuations in the teleconnections caused by differences in the sea level pressure and/or sea surface temperature (SST) play a crucial role in regulating the regional and global water cycles (Nalley et al., 2019). Moreover, the large-scale circulation factors reflect the natural phenomena of atmosphere-ocean Oscillations.The indices of circulation factors, such as the AO, Southern Oscilltion Index (SOI), NAO,and PDO,are effective and convenient predictors of the runoff variations (Nijssen et al., 2001; Nalley et al., 2019).

(2017) statistically quantified the relationships of the runoff with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), ENSO,and PDO of southern Texas at the regional scale, and their results indicated that the runoff is strongly modulated by the PDO and ENSO during the warm and cold seasons. Cheng et al.(2019） investigated the relationships between the runoff variations and large-scale circulation factors (PDO, NAO,AO,AMO,and ENSO) using the wavelet coherence method and found that the monthly runoff has a significant resonance periodicity with various circulation factors.Evidently, the combined effects and scale-dependent relationships between the runoff and multiple circulation factors have rarely been explored.

It exhibits highly complex non-linear and non-stationary characteristics and is affected by multiple combined factors (Nally et al.，2019; Wu et al.， 2020). Many previous studies have focused on the interaction relationships between the runoff and environmental factors,but these studies were mostly limited and ignored the combined effects of different driving factors (e.g.,Wei et al., 2014; Montaldo and Sarigu, 2Ol7). The bivariate wavelet coherence (WTC） method has been widely used to identify the interaction and phase relationships between two geological and/or hydrological variables on different timescales (Fang et al.,2015; Su et al.,2017; Wang et al.,2020). However, the WTC method can no longer be used when the purpose is to untangle the scale-specific and localized relationships involving more than two variables (Hu and Si,2016). Therefore,Hu and Si (2016) proposed a new method, i.e., the multiple wavelet coherence (MWC) approach, based on the WTC. Furthermore, they also compared the MWC method with multiple spectral coherence and multivariate empirical mode decomposition methods and found that the MWC method outperforms the other methods owing to its ability to determine the localized multivariate and scale-specific relationships on non-stationary and nonlinear geophysical time series.

Under the influences of both climate change and human activities,the streamflow in the YRB declined significantly in the mid-198Os because of reservoir construction, water abstraction, and water and soil conservation measures (Liu et al., 2O12).

The AO was used to describe the spatial distribution of the changes in the atmospheric anomalous phase between the Northern Hemisphere polar region and the mid-latitude sea level region (Thompson and Wallace, l998; Thompson and Wallace, 2001). It regulates the circulation paterns in the middle and high latitude regions and thus the frequency and intensity of the weather events (Givati and Rosenfeld, 2O13). The NAO index is defined as the difference between the normalized pressure at Gibraltar off southernmost Iberia and the normalized pressure in the south-western Iceland (Jones et al.， 1997). The PDO represents a pattern of Pacific climate variability similar to the ENSO but not as extreme and with a longer period (Mantua et al.,1997). The PDO index is calculated from the monthly mean SST anomalies north of $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { N }$ in the North Pacific (Hare and Mantua, 2OoO).The SOI is a measure of the atmospheric pressure gradient across the tropical Pacific. This version of the SOI is the difference between the normalized sea level pressure in Tahiti and Darwin,Australia (Hare and Mantua, 2000). The Nino3.4 index is the average SST anomaly in the region bounded by $5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { N }$ to $5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { S }$ and $1 7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { W }$ to $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { W }$ (Trenberth, 1997).

In addition, in the decadal period, the precipitation led the runoff by about $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ during the 1960s and 1980s (Fig. 4f). ",

However, the optimal combination that could explain the runoff variations in the lower reaches of the YRB was precipitation-NAO-SOI. In fact, the two different optimal combinations had internal relevance to a certain extent mainly because precipitation and the number of rainy days are different evaluation indices of the same atmospheric physical phenomenon. Moreover, the AO and NAO are similar in essence, both reflecting the strength of the mid-latitude westerly winds. The difference is that the horizontal scale of the AO is larger and the NAO is a representation of the AO in the North Atlantic region (Wallace, 20oo). Many previous studies have documented the fact that the NAO and AO indices have a significant high correlation coefficient, and both have a vital influence on the climate anomalies in the middle and high latitude regions of Asia (Hurrell, 1996;Deser, 2000;Wallace,2000).

Moreover, precipitation and AO were both contained in all of the combinations,which is similar to the two-factor combinations in the MWC analysis. The combination of precipitation, number of rainy days, and AO,and the combination of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and AO were both dominant modes of the runoff variability in the YRB. Moreover,among all of the one-,two-,and three-factor combinations investigated in this study, the combinations of two meteorological factors and one circulation factor were the dominant mode in controlling the runoff variability,with the largest PASC and MWC. Compared with the combinations of three meteorological factors, although the individual meteorological factors had stronger effects on the runoff variability than any of the individual circulation factors,the combinations of three meteorological factors were not the best mode for explaining the runoff variations (Fig.1O), which is partly due to the strong collinearity among the meteorological factors (Hu et al., 2O17). In simple terms, the runoff variations that are explained by additional factors on a certain time scale may have already been explained by the existing factors,and the overlapping eects weakened the ability of the additional factors to explain the runoff variability (Zhao et al., 2018). The MWC results of the combinations of two meteorological factors and one circulation factor are presented in Figure 9. Clearly, there was a continuous annual period from 195O to 2O19 at the Tangnaihai and Shizuishan hydrological stations. Notably， the combination of precipitation， evapotranspiration， and AO strongly controlled the runoff variations on 16- to 128-month time scales from 1970 to 1990 at the Tangnaihai hydrological station.

However, the influence of human activities (e.g.,reservoir and dam impoundment, water and soil conservation measures,and water intake and diversion) on the relationships between the runoff and different driving factors is still worth considering and discussing. Indeed, many previous studies have reported that human activities are a dominant factor for explaining the runoff changes in the YRB over the past five decades (Kong et al., 2016; Wang and Sun, 2020). The relevant soil and water conservation measures usually include afforestation, grass planting, and terrace construction (Kong et al., 2016). The indirect hydrological effect of land use changes on runoff variations has gradually increased over the last few decades (Li et al.， 2O2O0). Grass planting and afforestation directly enhance the vegetation coverage, thereby increasing the water storage capacity of the soil and enhancing rainwater infiltration (Wang et al., 2O12; Kong et al., 2016),which indirectly affect the runoff generation mechanism. In addition, permafrost degradation caused by rising temperatures changes the land cover types, which further strengthens the indirect effects of the land cover on the runoff signature variations in the source region of the YRB (Wang et al., 2O2O). Through land terracing, the concentrated flow is greatly regulated by limiting the water available for runoff (Feng et al., 2O2O). However, the construction of dams and reservoirs is the most direct way to regulate the hydrological cycle among all human activities in river basins (Vorosmarty et al.,2Oo3).In view of this,we further investigated the influence of human activities on the results of this study by taking the time of completion of four large reservoirs (the Longyangxia (1986), Liujiaxia (1968), Sanmenxia (1960),and Xiaolangdi (1999) reservoirs) on the mainstream of the Yellow River as key time nodes.The locations of the reservoirs are shown in Figure 1.

Mainly since the area above the Tangnaihai hydrological station is the source area of the YRB, the disturbance of the runoff caused by human activities is weak (Wang et al.,2012).The annual periodic oscillation intensity of the runoff at the Shizuishan hydrological station weakened after 1987， which wasmainly due to the construction of the Longyangxia Reservoir above the Shizuishan hydrological station in 1986.This reservoir further strengthened the distribution and regulation of the runoff (Wang et al., 2Oo6; Tian et al.,2019). However, according to the wavelet coherence analysis of the runoff and temperature at the Shizuishan hydrological station (Fig.4b),it is obvious that the controlling effect of the reservoir on the runoff had a negligible impact on the relationships between the runof and meteorological factors since the intensity of the annual common oscillation period was continuous throughout the study period. Furthermore, based on the wavelet power spectrum and wavelet coherence spectrum of the runoff at the Toudaoguai and Longmen hydrological stations (Figs. 2 and 4), the semi-annual period scale of the runoff and the common coherence between the runoff and meteorological factors on the semi-annual and annual scales at both stations did not exhibit significant variations after the operation of the Longyangxia Reservoir.

There was almost no significant variation in the annual oscillation intensity of the runof at the Lijin hydrological station. However, the wavelet power spectrum of the runoff at the Huayuankou hydrological station exhibited a progressive energy loss trend on the annual period scale after 1986 (Fig.2e), which is consistent with the time at which the operation of the Longyangxia Reservoir began. In addition, the intensity of the wavelet coherence between the runoff and meteorological factors was almost continuous on the annual scale at the Huayuankou hydrological station, which indicates that the operation of the reservoirs did not seriously interfere with the identification of the fine structure of the runoff evolution conducted in this study.

        "text": "Based on the results of this study, it was found that as the number of factors in the combination increases, the MWC also increases, whereas the PASC may not necessarily increase. Taking the Tangnaihai hydrological station as an example,the influence of four-factor combinations on the runoff was further analyzed (data were not shown),and it was found that the average MWC was 0.915.Although the value of the MWC increased, the rate of increase decreased as the number of combination factors increased.From one- to two-factor combinations,from two- to three-factor combinations,and from three- to four-factor combinations,the average rates of increase were 0.279, 0.148,and O.060,respectively. However, the average PASC of the four-factor combinations was $2 9 . 1 4 \\%$ ，which is $7 . 5 4 \\%$ lower than that of the three-factor combinations,which may be due to the increase in the PASC threshold for statistical significance after adding an additional factor 0 $\\mathrm { N g }$ and Chan,2Ol2). Therefore,in this study,we found that a combination of three-factors is sufficient to explain the variations in the multiscale characteristics of the runoff in the YRB. Furthermore， the meteorological factors directly affect the runoff, while the large-scale atmospheric circulation factors indirectly influence the runoff via hydrological or meteorological processes (Su et al.,2O19). Consequently, the meteorological factors can explain the variations in the runoff in different time-frequency domains better. However, when all of the factors contained in a combination are meteorological factors,it is not necessarily the optimal combination for explaining the variations in the runof.Part of the reason for this is that the overlapping effect caused by the collinearity among the factors reduces the variance contribution of some of the factors (Hu et al., 2O17). Moreover, the ocean climate signals usually last for a long time due to the huge heat capacity of the ocean， which makes the potential predictability of large-scale circulation factors stronger (Gobena and Gan, 2009; Su et al.,2018). Therefore,combinations of large-scale circulation factors and meteorological factors are usually more reasonable for explaining the variations in the runoff on all time scales. ",

        "text": "Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between the runoff and precipitation in various sections of the YRB.Liu and Cui (2O11） showed that the response of the runoff to precipitation exhibits strong nonlinearity and is more sensitive in dry regions or years in the YRB. Li et al. (2Ol2) explored the response of the runoff to climate change in the source region of the Yellow River,and their results revealed that rainfall is the dominant driver of the runoff in this region.In the middle reaches of the YRB, Zhao et al. (2O14) found that there is a significant positive relationship between the runoff and precipitation, and there is a simultaneous decreasing trend from 1950 to 2010. Therefore,it makes sense that precipitation is contained in all of the optimal combinations. Moreover, the AO is one of the major features of the global climate system. as its regional counterpart, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)(Gong et al.，2002),which mainly influences the precipitation and cyclonic activity in the high and mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Jones et al.,1997; Givati and Rosenfeld,2013). In addition,owing to the enhancement of the polar night jet stream, the positive winter AO can not only prevent the cold air in the polar region from invading the high latitude regions of East Asia, leading to warm air advection from the North Atlantic to the high latitude regions of Europe,but also cause more precipitation in the high latitude regions of Eurasia (Thompson and Wallace, 2O01). According to Gong and Wang (2003) and Park et al. (2011), the positive winter AO is associated with the positive precipitation anomalies over inland China, especially over central China $( 3 0 ^ { \\circ }  – 4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { N }$ east of $1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { E } )$ . Therefore， it is reasonable that the combinations of precipitation-AO and precipitation-NAO can explain the runof variations in the upstream and midstream reaches of the YRB better (Tangnaihai， Shizuishan， Toudaoguai， and Longmen hydrological stations). Furthermore， the global circulation factors mainly modulate the inter-annual to decadal oscillations in the runoff (Gobena and Gan,2Oo9),，whereas the meteorological factors mainly control the seasonal and annual periods of the runof. Therefore,the weak collinearity between the different types of driving factors means that the combination modes can synergistically explain the runoff variations on all timescales in the YRB better.

In addition, the WTC and MWC methods were used to investigate the synergistic effects and scale-dependent relationships between the runoff and various driving factors.The CWT results indicate that the runoff exhibited significant continuous or discontinuous annual oscillations during the study period at the Tangnaihai， Shizuishan, Huayuankou, and Lijin hydrological stations,while significant semiannual and annual periods occurred simultaneously with intermittent breaks at the Toudaoguai and Longmen hydrological stations.Scattered inter-annual time scales were also observed at all of the hydrological stations. The WTC results show that the meteorological factors can explain the runoff variations better than the atmospheric circulation factors.The AWC and PASC between the runof and individual meteorological factors were 0.454 and $1 9 . 8 9 \\%$ , respectively. Among all of the circulation factors investigated, the AO and PDO most significantly affected the multiscale characteristics of the runoff variations.The meteorological factors mainly affected the runoff on seasonal and annual time scales， whereas the atmospheric circulation factors mainly regulated the runoff on inter-annual and decadal time scales.

Among all of the two- or three-factor combinations,the MWC analysis indicates that the precipitation-evapotranspiration (or the number of rainy days)-AO combination performed the best in terms of revealing the multiscale characteristics of the runoff in the YRB. The results of this study are conducive to understanding hydrology-climate interactions and to predicting the future trend of the runoff under changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions.Moreover, further study should be conducted to explore the nonlinear relationships between the runoff and additional atmospheric circulation factors.
