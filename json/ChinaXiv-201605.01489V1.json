We also noted strong biases for Uand A residues at nucleotide positions 1 and 10,respectively,in both piRNAs and mRNA fragments,features that resemble the pattern of piRNA amplification by the‘ping-pong’cycle.Through mapping of MIWI-RNA interactions by CLIP-seq and gene expresson profiling, we found that many potential piRNA-targeted mRNAs directly interact with MIWI and show elevated expression levels in the testes of Miwi catalytic mutant mice. Reporter-based assays further revealed the importance of base pairing between piRNAs and mRNA targets and the requirement for both the slicer activity and piRNA-loading abilityof MIWIin piRNA-mediated target repression. Importantly,we demonstrated that proper turnoverof certain key piRNA targets is esential for sperm formation. Together,these findings reveal the siRNA-like functionof the piRNA machinery in mouse testes and itscentral requirement for male germ cell development and maturation. ",

Increasing evidence suggests that piRNAs play a critical role in both epigenetic and post-transcriptional silencing of transposons [1,6]. Several studies indicate that piRNAs in Drosophila have the capacity to downregulate the expression of certain mRNA targets via a miRNA-like mechanism that operates by imperfect base-pairing rules [9-13]. However, it is not yet known whether andto what extent this mechanism is involved in regulating gene expression in mammals. ",

Interestingly,mouse piRNAs are expressed in two distinct phases during spermatogenesis, termed as pre-pachytene and pachytene piRNAs,respectively.Pre-pachytene piRNAs are mainly derived from transposons and are coexpressed with MIWI2 and/or MILI in fetal and perinatal male germ cells,and function in transposon silencing, thereby protecting the genome in early-stage spermatogenic cells [14-16]. Pachytene piRNAs,on the other hand,are massively produced from non-transposon intergenic regions in later pachytene spermatocytes and post-meiotic spermatids,and are mainly associated with MIWI.However,little is known about the functional significance of MIWI and the MIWI-bound pachytene piRNAs.

We identified approximately 200 potential piRNA target sites on specific mRNAs,thus implicating piRNAs in mediating cleavage of these mRNAs in mouse male germ cells.Following this initial finding,we performed anti-MIWI crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing(CLIP-seq) on enriched mouse round spermatids and demonstrated that ${ \\sim } 4 3 \\%$ of the identified piRNA target sites were physically associated with MIWI. Subsequently,we validated the MIWI/ piRNA-mediated repression of target mRNAs with reporter-based assays and showed that both the slicer activityand the piRNA-loadingability of MIWI are critical for the piRNA-mediated target repression. Importantly, ectopic expression of piRNA-resistant forms of target genes in spermatids prevented the formation of sperms, suggesting that proper turnover of certain piRNA targets is essential for normal spermiogenesis.

        "text": "In summary, our present study combined computational and experimental approaches to deduce rules for piRNA:mRNA interactions through analyzing sequence complementarity, location of target sites,as well as piRNA reads that match their target sites.Even though the rules that we deduced are subject to further refinement, our data suggest that the productive piRNA:mRNA interactions require(1)a minimal ${ \\sim } 1 6$ -nt continuous complementarity between piRNAs and mRNAs,(2） strict base pairing at the $5 ^ { \\prime }$ end of piRNAs, $( 3 ) < 3$ mismatches in subsequent 2O nt sequences,(4) conserved $3 ^ { \\prime }$ -UTRsas preferred piRNA target sites,and(5)U and A residues enriched at the 1st and 1Oth positions in piRNAs that target specific mRNAs.Given that millions of piRNAs are expressed in mouse testes and their roles in silencing transposons have been well-documented,it will be of significance in future studies to determine which portion of the piRNA machinery is devoted to protecting the ge nome against transposable elements and which portion is involved in the regulation of protein-coding genes,as well as these two processes is coordinated in different stages of male germ cell development in mammals.
