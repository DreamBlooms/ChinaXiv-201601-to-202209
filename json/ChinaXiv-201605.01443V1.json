The two proteins share overall structural similarity,but differ distinctly in the DNA-binding region between $\\beta 3 -$ and $\\beta 4$ -strands.While Sul7d possesses a hinge of two amino acid residues, Cren7 contains a flexible seven-residue loop (loop $\\beta 3 \\mathrm { - } \\beta 4 )$ in the region.Here,we report the role of loop $\\beta 3 \\mathrm { - } \\beta 4$ in the interaction of Cren7 with duplex DNA.We show that all residues with a large side chain on the loop,i.e.,Pro3O,Lys31, Arg33 and Lys34,contributed significantly to the binding of Cren7 to DNA.The three basic amino acids affected the ability of Cren7 to constrain negative DNA supercoils in a residue number-dependent manner. The crystal structure of a complex between a mutant Cren7 protein (GR) with loop $\\beta 3 \\mathrm { - } \\beta 4$ replaced by two residues (Gly and Arg) to mimic the hinge at the corresponding position in Sul7d and an 8-bp dsDNA has been determined. Structural comparison between the GR-DNA and Cren7-DNA complexes shows that GR resembles Sul7d more than Cren7 in DNAbinding size and in the effect on the width of the major groove of DNA and the pattern of DNA bending.However, GRinduces smaller DNA curvature than Sul7d.Our results suggest that Cren7 and Sul7d package chromosomal DNA in a slightly different fashion,presumably permitting different chromosomal accessibility by proteins functioning in DNA transactions.

        "text": "Genomic DNA must be compacted to be accommodated by the cell while kept accessible to molecular machineries for DNA transactions.Chromatin proteins are respon sible for the compaction and organization of the chromosomal DNA (Luijsterburg et al. 2OO8).Eukarya encode histones,which wrap DNA around the core octamer to form a nucleosome (Luger et al. 1997). In bacteria, the chromosomal DNA is compacted into a nucleoid by a number of small DNA-binding proteins,such as HU, IHF,H-NS,Fis and Lrp (Dame 2005;Wu 2004). However,the situation is more complex in Archaea as different archaeal phyla may employ different sets of DNAbinding proteins (Zhang et al. 2O1O).Alba is a unique nucleic acid-binding protein highly conserved among the domain Archaea (Bell et al. 2OO2).However, the protein appears to bind both DNA and RNA(Guo et al. 2003; Marsh et al. 2Oo5). Therefore, the physiological roles of Alba remain to be understood.Euryarchaea produce archaeal histones capable of packaging DNA in a similar manner to their eukaryal counterparts (Reeve 2003; Sandman and Reeve 2Oo5).However, archaeal histones are absent in crenarchaea with the exception of some species (Cubonova et al. 20o5). Several small DNA-binding proteins,including Sul7d,CC1 and Cren7,have been isolated from crenarchaea (Grote et al. 1986;Guo et al. 2008;Luo et al. 2007).While Sul7d and CC1 are phylogenetically restricted to some crenarchaeal species, Cren7 is highly conserved in the phylum (Zhang et al. 2012).It is suggested that crenarchaea may have evolved a Cren7-based DNA packaging strategy.

        "text": "Loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ of Cren7 comprises seven amino acid residues, i.e.,Ala29,Pro30,Lys31,Gly32,Arg33,Lys34 and Gly35. We have previously shown that single-alanine substitution of Pro30,Lys31 or Arg33,each of whichis located on the DNA-binding surface of Cren7,resulted in significant reduction in binding affinity of the protein for dsDNA (Zhang et al.2O1O). To learn more about the role of loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ in the interaction of Cren7 with DNA,we first introduced a single-alanine substitution at Pro30,Lys31,Arg33 or Lys34 and double-and triple-alanine substitutions at the latter three basic amino acid residues,and compared the ability of these mutants to bind DNA and constrain negative DNA super coils (supplementary figure S1, Fig. 2; Tables 1,2).All the mutants showed reduced binding affinity for DNA,as compared to that of wild-type Cren7. The four single mutants, i.e.,P30A,K31A,R33A and K34A,were similar in binding affinity with $K _ { \\mathrm { D } }$ values in the $1 0 ^ { - 7 } \\mathrm { ~ M ~ }$ range. However, the scattred distribution of the mutants in the $k _ { \\mathrm { a } } / k _ { \\mathrm { d } }$ map suggests that these amino acid residues may differ in their roles in DNA binding by Cren7.The association rate constant $( k _ { \\mathrm { a } } )$ of P30A was nearly identical to that of wild-type Cren7, but the dissociation rate constant $( k _ { \\mathrm { d } } )$ of the mutant was fourfold as high as that of the wild-type protein.Presumably, the hydrophobic interactions between the side chain of $\\mathrm { P r o } 3 0$ and the bases of the DNA serve to stabilize the Cren7- DNA complex. On the other hand, mutation of each of the three basic amino acid residues was accompanied by a 10- to 20-fold increase in both $k _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ and $k _ { \\mathrm { d } }$ and, therefore,only a slight decrease in DNA-binding affinity. Among the three single mutations,substitution of Ala31 for Lys31 resulted in the largest decrease ( ${ \\bf \\tilde { \\rho } } _ { \\sim } 5  \\bf \\$ fold) in DNA-binding affinity, pointing to the importance ofLys31 in the interaction of the protein with the DNA.R33A showed a slight reduction $( \\sim 1 . 3$ fold) in DNAbinding,because its rates of both association and dissociation increased to similar extents.Notably, mutation of Lys34,which is not in contact with the DNA in the crystals (Zhang et al. 2O1O),also led to a twofold decrease in the binding affinity of the protein,raising the possibility that the residue interacts with the DNA in solution.This is consistent with the observation that alanine substitution of both Lys34 and Lys31 or Arg33 further reduced the binding affinity by two- or fivefold, respectively,as compared to that of K31A or R33A.In fact, the $K _ { \\mathrm { D } }$ values of the three double mutants (K31A/R33A,K31A/K34A and R33A/K34A) were similar $( 1 . 2 \\mathrm { - } 1 . 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { M } )$ .Moreover, the double mutants were clustered in the $k _ { \\mathrm { a } } / k _ { \\mathrm { d } }$ map, exhibiting a tenfold decrease in DNA-binding affinity,as a result of a slight decrease in both $k _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ and $k _ { \\mathrm { d } }$ values,as compared to those of the wild-type protein. Substitution of all three basic residues with alanine reduced the binding affinityof Cren7for DNAby over two orders of magnitude,emphasizing the critical role of the positively charged residues on loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ in the interaction of the protein with the DNA. Intriguingly, the drastic loss in DNA binding by K31A/R33A/K34A was due primarily to a 40-fold decrease in the $k _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ of the protein.A threefold reduction was observed in the dissociation rate constant of the triple mutant.It is worth noting that both the double and the triple mutants had similar dissociation rate constants.These results suggest that the positive surface electric potential in the loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ region plays a key role in the Cren7-DNA interaction and contributes more to the association of Cren7 to DNA than to the stabilization of the Cren7-DNA complex.

This presumably resulted from the small difference in the experimental conditions (e.g.， temperature,ionic strength) of the nick ligation assay and electrophoresis in agarose gel (Mai et al. 1998). As increasing amounts of the protein were added to the reaction and thus increasing amounts of negative supercoils were constrained by the protein,the ligated plasmid first lost positive supercoils and subsequently accumulated negative supercoils. The linking changes of the ligated pBR322 were measured by band counting and plotted against the protein/DNA mass ratios (Fig.3b).The slope of each plot is taken as a measure of the efficiency of the protein in constraining DNA supercoils.

This translates into binding of 2O7 to 253 Cren7 molecules to a plasmid molecule according to the stoichiometry of 9-11 Cren7 molecules for a constrained supercoil (Zhang et al. 2O1O). Given a DNA-binding site size of $^ { \\sim 8 }$ bp,\\~545 Cren7 molecules are required to saturate the 4361-bp pBR322 DNA molecule.Therefore,the binding of Cren7 to the plasmid DNA was far from saturation at the mass ratio of 1:1.This is consistent with our previous finding that Cren7 did not saturate the pBR322 DNA until the mass ratio reached 8:1 (Guo et al. 2008). P30A constrained DNA supercoils as efficiently as wildtype Cren7. Since the former was fourfold weaker than the latterin bindingto DNA,it seems that the ability of Cren7 to constrain DNA supercoils is not directly related to the affinity of the protein to DNA.All of the remaining alanine substitution mutants of Cren7 showed significantly reduced ability to constrain negative DNA supercoils,as compared to that of the wild-type protein. There appears to be a general correlation between the number of basic residues on loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ and the supercoil-constraining ability of the protein variants. Cren7 containing one,two or three alanine substitutions at Lys31,Arg33 and Lys34 residues was approximately 2-,4- or 16-fold,respectively,less efficient in constraining DNA supercoils than the wild-type protein. In other words, the effciency of supercoil constraining by the protein decreased by approximately fourfold with the loss of each basic residue on loop $\\mathsf { \\beta 3 - } \\mathsf { \\beta 4 }$ . Notably， little difference in DNA supercoiling was observed between the three single mutants or between the two double mutants, although each of the two sets of the mutants differed among themselves in DNA-binding affinity.

This is not unexpected since the two glycine residues are not in contact with DNA in the Cren7-DNA cocrystals (Zhang et al.2O1O).

Since the protein variants eluted as monomers in the expected peak showed calculated molecular masses ranging from 8.86 to $9 . 0 5 \\ \\mathrm { k D a }$ ，the protein species that came off the column in the additional peak appeared to be dimers based on their molecular masses( $1 8 . 6 { - } 2 1 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { k D a }$ in size).

Sequence alignment of the two structurally homologous proteins reveals the similarity between the two residues(Gly32-Arg33) in the middle of loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ of Cren7 and the hinge region of Sac7d (Gly27-Lys28). A question then arises as to whether the function of loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ in Cren7 can be maintained by a much shorter hinge similar to that in Sac7d. To answer this question,we prepared three deletion mutant proteins of Cren7, denoted LD, GR and GK，respectively (Table 1).LD,constructed by deleting the Pro3O-Lys34 region,had a short loop consisting of an alanine residue and a glycine residue.To mimic the hinge between $\\beta 3$ and $\\beta 4$ strandsin Sac7d, GR and GK were made by substituting the seven-residue $\\mathsf { \\beta 3 - } \\mathsf { \\beta 4 }$ loop for a two-residue stretch (i.e.,Gly-Arg for GR and GlyLys for GK).DNA binding by these mutants was analyzed by SPR (Table 2). In agreement with a previous report (Feng et al. 2010), the $K _ { \\mathrm { D } }$ of LD was ${ \\sim } 2 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ ，whichwas nearly 2OO-fold higher than that of wild-type Cren7 $( \\sim 1 2 3$ nM).The substantial loss in the binding affinity of LD for DNA was almost entirely attributable to an increase in $k _ { \\mathrm { d } }$ ，which was too high to be determined from the dissociation curves,indicating that the LD-DNA complex was veryunstable.By comparison, the affinities of GR and GK for DNA were lower than the wild-type protein by only ${ \\sim } 1 0 -$ and ${ \\sim } 2 0$ -fold,respectively.A slight decrease in $k _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ and amodest increase in $k _ { \\mathrm { d } }$ were observed for both mutant proteins.The difference between LD and GR(or GK） in DNA-binding affinity indicates that the positive charge in the loop region is crucial to the binding of Cren7 to DNA. Since LD binds to DNA less tightly than the triple substitution mutant (K31A/R33A/K34A),in which the three basic residues on loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ were replaced with alanine,the size of the loop appears to contribute to the stability of the Cren7-DNA complex as well.This is also supported by the resemblance of both GR and GK to the double-substitution mutants (K31A/R33A,K31A/K34A and R33A/K34A） in DNA-binding kinetics and affinity,as shown by the clustering of these mutants in the $k _ { \\mathrm { a } } / k _ { \\mathrm { d } }$ map (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, both GR and GK constrained supercoils with slightly higher efficiencies than the double substitution mutants,although the former hadlower affinity for DNA than the latter (Table 2).It is speculated that replacement of the long loop,which covers 2 bp of DNA(Zhang etal. 2O1O),with a short hinge in Cren7 would reduce the binding size of the protein,allow increased binding density and thus enhance the efficiency of the protein to constrain DNA supercoils.Taken together, our results show that replacement of loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ with a short hinge lacking a positively charged amino acid residue significantly impaired the ability of Cren7 to bind DNA and to constrain DNA supercoils,and this ability of the protein was partially restored if the hinge region contained a positivelycharged residue.

The phosphate group between T2 and G3 in the DNA bound by wild-type Cren7 is translocated as a result of the formation of a hydrogen bond to Lys31，resulting in distortion in the backbone. Bycomparison,theDNA backbone in the GR-DNA and Sac7d-DNA complexes is much smoother due to the lack of direct contacts between the loop and the backbone phosphate group. ",

The reduction in DNA curvature in the GR-DNA complex is mainly due to negative rolls at the G1pT2 and C6pA7 steps(about $- 4 . 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $- 1 0 . 4 ^ { \\circ }$ ，respectively)，since a positive roll of $2 . 2 ^ { \\circ }$ and a slightly negative roll of about $- 4 . 7 ^ { \\circ }$ are observed at the corresponding steps in the wild-type Cren7-DNA complex. The change in negative roll at the GlpT2 step in GRDNA seems to have resulted from the loss of the contacts between GR and the G1:C16 pair of the DNA duplex (sup plementary figure S2).On the other hand, the conformational change ofLys24 side chain,which interacts directly with the phosphate group of C6,may be responsible for the increase in negative roll at the C6pA7 step in the GR-DNA complex (Fig. 5C; supplementary figure S2).

Investigation of the differences between the two proteins is of importance to the understanding of their respective roles in chromosomal organization and other DNA transactions in vivo.Structural comparison between Cren7 and Sac7d reveals that the most distinguishing feature of the two proteins in DNA-binding surface is the size of the amino acid stretch between $\\beta 3$ and $\\beta 4$ strands (Zhang et al. 201O). Notably, loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ is highly conserved among Cren7 homologs (Fig.1).In the present study,we show that loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ serves a critical role in the structural integrity of and DNA binding and supercoil constraining by Cren7.

        "text": "All amino acid residues on loop $\\beta 3 \\mathrm { - } \\beta 4$ that have a relatively long side chain,i.e.,Pro30,Lys31,Arg33 and Lys34,contribute significantly to DNA binding by Cren7 (Table 1).Alanine substitution of Pro3O destabilized the Cren7-DNA complex,while mutation of the basic amino acid residues affected primarily the binding step of the Cren7-DNA interaction.Interestingly， thepositively charged side chains ofLys31 andLys34 are not in direct contact with the DNA in crystals (Zhang et al. 2O10). So the finding that their replacement with an uncharged alanine reduced the DNA-binding affinity of the protein suggests that the positive charges on the surface of loop $\\beta 3 \\mathrm { - } \\beta 4$ play a role in the interaction between Cren7 and DNA in solution.Further,nick-closure assays showed that the efficiencies of Cren7 mutants in constraining DNA supercoils were related proportionally to the number of basic residues on the loop (Fig.3). The decrease in the ability of the Cren7 mutants in constraining DNA supercoils may not be attributed solely to the decrease in the affinity of these mutants for the DNA,since P3OA,which showed a much reduced affinity for DNA as compared to wild-type Cren7, constrained DNA supercoils as efficiently as the wild-type protein.A possibility exists that the positively charged residues on loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ are primarily involved in the deformation of DNA by Cren7. It is noticed that the Lys31 residue undergoes reversible methylation (Guo et al. 2O08).Lysine methylation in eukaryotic histones has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of chromosomal structure and gene expression (Grant 2001; Hansen et al. 2006).A similarregulatoryrole mayalso be proposedforLys31,which distorts the DNA backbone in the Cren7-DNA crystals through the formation of hydrogen bond to the phosphate group of the DNA.

        "text": "The two highly conserved glycine residues on loop $\\beta 3 -$ $\\beta 4$ (Gly32 and Gly35） appear to be critical to the proper folding of Cren7.Mutation of either of the two residues led to dimerization of the protein (Fig.4). The structural basis forthe dimerization of the Cren7 mutants isunclear.It has been reported that mutation of a glycine residue (Gly55) promotes the conversion of the IgG-binding domain of proteinL from a monomeric form into a dimeric form at a protein concentration of above $3 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ (Kuhlman et al. 2001). The 62-residue domain consists of an $\\alpha$ -helix packed on a four-stranded $\\beta$ -sheet formed by two $\\beta$ -hairpins.Alanine substitution of Gly55,located in the C-terminal hairpin, straightens the four-residue turn in this hairpin，allowing the C-terminal $\\beta$ strand to extend out and insert into a partner protomer to form a domain-swapped dimer. Conceivably, the mutant Cren7 proteins may form dimers in a similar manner to the IgG-binding domain of protein L. It is possible that, once the glycine residue is mutated, loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ becomes less flexible,and the straightened loop permits the $\\beta 4$ and $\\beta 5$ strands to flip out. The two $\\beta$ strands then form an intact $\\beta$ barrel with the $\\beta 1 , \\beta 2$ and $\\beta 3$ strands from another Cren7 mutant protomer. Dimerization of the mutant Cren7 protein would presumably be favored in vivo,given the millimolar levels of the protein present in Sulfolobus. Therefore,the two glycine residues appear to be essential in maintaining the flexibility of loop $\\beta 3 \\mathrm { - } \\beta 4$ and the monomeric form of Cren7 in vivo. ",

        "text": "The presence of a much longer loop between $\\beta 3$ and $\\beta 4$ strands in Cren7 than that in Sul7d raises a question about the role of the size of the loop on the properties of the proteins.Deletion of five residues in the middle of loop $_ { \\beta 3 - \\beta 4 }$ resulted in drastic loss in both DNA-binding and supercoilconstraining abilities of Cren7.The loss of function of the shortened loop was not effectively compensated even when theloop was a small two-residue hinge (i.e.,Gly29-Arg30 for GR or Gly29-Lys30 for GK),which mimicked that in Sac7d (Figs. 2, 3). Comparison of the crystal structures of wild-type Cren7 and GR in complex with dsDNA reveals the structural basis for the possible functional differences between the long loop and the small hinge. First, GR occupies a binding site $( \\sim 6 ~ \\mathrm { b p } )$ ） smaller than that of wild-type Cren7 $( \\sim 8 ~ \\mathrm { { b p } ) }$ . Second, no base pair contacts by GR were observed in the region from G1-C16 to G3-C14,and thus the DNA strand appears much smoother than that bound by the wild-type protein. Third, DNA is less bent in the GRDNA complex $( \\sim 5 9 . 6 ^ { \\circ } )$ than in the wild-type Cren7-DNA complex $( \\sim 6 9 . 4 ^ { \\circ } )$ . Given the potential effect of DNA bending on DNA compaction，possession of the long loop is important for Cren7 to play a role in chromosomal DNA organization. Fourth, GR but not Cren7 narrows the major groove at the intercalation site.In this regard,GR shows greater resemblance to Sul7d than to Cren7.In fact,as compared to Cren7,both GR and Sul7d possess smaller DNAbinding sizes,and bend DNA without severely distorting the backbone. An exception is that the DNA curvature induced by GR is smaller than that by Sul7d.We infer from these results that the size of loop $\\beta 3 \\mathrm { - } \\beta 4$ may influence the width of the major groove of dsDNA bound by the chromatin protein and, therefore, the chromosomal accessibility of other DNA-binding proteins that function in various DNAassociated activities.The distinct difference in the impact between Cren7 and Sul7d on the major groove of DNA is consistent with non-redundant functions of the two chromatin proteins in DNA packaging and transactions.
