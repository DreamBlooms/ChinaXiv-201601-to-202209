        "text": "The whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) causes tremendous damage to cotton production worldwide. However,very limited information is available about how plants perceive and defend themselves from this destructive pest.In this study,the transcriptomic differences between two cotton cultivars that exhibit either strong resistance (HR)or sensitivity(ZS)to whitefly were compared at different time points (0,12,24 and $4 8 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ after infection) using RNA-Seq.Approximately one billion paired-end reads were obtained by Illumina sequencing technology. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the cotton transcriptional response to whitefly infestation involves genes encoding protein kinases,transcription factors,metabolite synthesis,and phytohormone signaling.Furthermore,a weighted gene co-expression network constructed from RNA-Seq datasets showed that WRKY40 and copper transport protein are hub genes that mayregulate cotton defenses to whitefly infestation.Silencing GhMPK3 by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) resulted in suppression of the MPK-WRKY-JA and ET pathways and lead to enhanced whitefly susceptibility,suggesting that the candidate insect resistant genes identified in this RNA-Seq analysis are credible and offer significant utility.Taken together,this study provides comprehensive insights into the cotton defense system to whitefly infestation and has identified several candidate genes for control of phloem-feeding pests.

Whiteflies negatively impact crop production through direct feeding,induction of host plant phytotoxic disorders,transmission of diverse viruses,and honeydew-associated fungal growths (Inbar and Gerling，20o8;Jones,20o3).With prolonged infestation,they will cause shedding of young cotton bolls,resulting in considerable cotton fibre yield loss.Among the whitefly complex, species commonly referred to as B-and Q-biotypes are the most invasive and economically damaging throughout the world.In China,the more destructive B-biotype,also referred to as the Middle East-Asia Minor1(MEAM1) species,Was initially detected in the mid 1990s (Tay et al.，2012). In contrast，the Q-type, classified as the Mediterranean (MED) species,isa more recent introduction into China (Chu et al.,2oo6).However,both species have rapidly extended throughout the country (Zhang et al., 2005).Because whiteflies are capable of long，continuous interactions with the plant host (Kempema et al.，2007),they arean ideal model system for studying the interactions between phloem-feeding pests and the plant host.

They have therefore evolved elaborate defense systems during the $\\mathord { \\sim } 3 5 0$ million years of co-evolution with plants (Gatehouse, 2002；Mithofer and Boland,20o8). In addition to the physical barrier (i.e.thicknessand trichomes),secondary metabolites and toxic compounds,plants have also evolved a constitutive defense system.For direct defense，plants mobilize a variety of defense signalling pathways and activate the expression of defense genes that function in the synthesis of secondary metabolites.Compelling evidence has accumulated indicating the crucial importanceofplant secondary metabolites， such asgossypol, glucosinolates,cyanogenic glucosides,alkaloids，phenolics，and proteinase inhibitors (Pls),functioning as toxins,repellents and/or anti-digestives (Arimura etal.，2011；Furstenberg-Hägg et al., 2013;Wu and Baldwin，201O)．The plant defense system is regulated by a suite of phytohormones,including jasmonic acid (JA)，salicylic acid (SA)，ethylene (ET)，abscisic acid (ABA), brassinosteroids (BR),and gibberellin (GA;Arimura et al.，2005; Jin et al.,2011; Kempema et al.,2007; Loake and Grant,2007; Sunet al.，2O11). In the indirect defense system,plants release volatile substances that attract natural enemies of the pest, thus enlisting the aid of another organism to reduce damage to the plant.Evolution of these two powerful defense systems in plants have enabled them to effectively compete in their evolutionary arms race with herbivores (Kesslerand Baldwin,2002).

High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-based analyses, however，revealed that mature leaves of both the HR and ZS cultivars had similar gossypol content (Figure 1h).These data suggest that the phenotypic differences in whitefly susceptibility between the ZS and HR cultivars may be more mechanism-based. Consequently, the two cultivars are ideal candidates for studying the transcriptional effects of whitefly infestation on cotton. ",

Based on the hierarchical clustering analysis， the expression patterns ofDEGs were clustered into five classes.Class I genes，which function in oxidation-reduction and compound metabolic processes (i.e. beta-galactosidase 5,tubulin beta 8,expansin protein,zinc finger proteins,heat shock proteins and cytochrome P450 superfamily proteins)，were highly abundant genes that were significantly down-regulated in the HR and ZS cultivars at $4 8 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ postinfestation.The expression profile of these DEGs,however,was inverted in the HR and ZS cultivars at $2 4 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ post-infestation.The 75DEGs comprising the class Il genes (i.e.pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein,LAC14 and SOUL heme-binding family proteins) showed similar expression patterns in both cultivars throughout the whitefly infestation period.Class Ill (i.e.ERF8, TPS21） genes began to exhibit down-regulation in both the HR and ZS cultivars at $2 4 \\ h$ post-infestation and were significantly down-regulated at $4 8 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ .Class IV genes (i.e.plasma membrane intrinsic protein，oxidative stress3 and pathogenesis-related protein）were largely up-regulated in both cultivars at $4 8 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ post-infestation; however,a subset of genes in this GO class were specifically up-regulated within the $2 4 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ time period (Table S3). Overall,the expression profile of DEGs present in both cultivars was consistent with up-regulation or down-regulation apparent in HR and ZS at the same period of infestation.However，the expression profile of numerous genes unique to the respective HR and ZS cultivars exhibited inverse expression profiles.These differences in expression may account for the contrasting resistance phenotypes in the two cultivars.

Other zinc finger-containing transcription factors from the C2H2，C3H and CCT domain protein family were also up-regulated during the later stage of infestation.Among the 25MYBs were identified,the expression profiles of MYB111,MYB73 and an AP2/B3 type were similar at all time points in HR and ZS.In addition,ERF1 and heat-shock transcription factor (HSF)，which are crucial in phytohormone signalling,were also detected in our transcriptome data.Detailed information on the expression profiles of these transcription factors is summarized in Figure 8.

DEG counts were prioritized relative to DESeq followed by two methods for assessing DEG distribution (Figure S4),which were then validated by qRT-PCR.Differential expression analyses revealed that more DEGs were present in the HR cultivar than ZS at all the time points,and that DEGs gradually increased with infestation time in HR.More down-regulated genes were identified than up-regulated in most of the HR and ZS samples at $2 4 ~ \\mathsf { h }$ .These results are supported by previous studies reporting that infestations of whiteflies and aphids drive transcriptional suppresson over induction (De Vos et al.,20o5; Dubey et al.,2013). However,our results contrast with that observed in cotton damaged by chewing insects，such as the cotton boll weevil (Artico et al.，2014)，in which up-regulation $>$ downregulation.The different types of damage that chewing and sapsucking insectsinflect may explain the discrepancy in the respective transcriptional responses by cotton.GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that metabolic processes, transcription factors,transmembrane transport and responses to stress related genesmight be involved in host plant resistance to infestations by phloem-feeding insects.Comparison of our data on phloem-feeding insect infestation with publically available (i.e. NCBI)data on chewing insects suggested that expression of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and responses to biotic stimuli were significantly higher in cotton infested by whiteflies than infested by a chewing insect.Several transcription factors such as WRKY40 and NACo45 were identified and shown to form complex connections with other genes (Figure 7).The results shown in Figure 7d,e indicated that WRKY40，copper transport protein,P450 superfamily proteins and NRT may be hub genes that regulate cotton defenses to whitefly infestation.

Several studies have revealed that ROS are implicated in both pathogen and herbivory-induced responses in plants (Liu et al.,2010;Wu and Baldwin,201O).KEGG analysis also suggested that ROS and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were significant $( P < 0 . 0 1$ ; Figure 6).The transcription of multiple genes related to ROS scavenging and redox homeostasis, such as the $G S T U$ family protein cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD5) were down-regulated in response to whitefly infestation，suggesting that whitefly feeding may induce the accumulation of ROS (Kempema et al.,2oo7). RLKs are well-known to be involved in the perception of pathogen-derived elicitors (Liebrand et al., 2013;Montesano etal.,2oo3).RLKsare transmembrane proteins with putative extracellular domains and intracellular protein kinase domains that perceive external signals and initiate signal cascades (Gou et al.，201O).RLKs/RLPs Were more abundant in the ZS cultivar compared to the HR cultivar,suggesting a potential role in conferring the resistance phenotype.Furthermore, ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ has been recognized as an important second messenger involved in many plant signalling actions including responses to herbivory, pathogens,and stress responses (Wu and Baldwin,2010). ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ signalling related genes,such as calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK6), ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ -binding proteins (EDA310),calcium-binding EF-hand family protein and calmodulins,were elevated during the early infestation stage with significantly higher levels in ZS than in HR.These genes were dramatically up-regulated at the initial infestation stage and then down-regulated during the later infestation stages.It has been shown that mechanical wounding andinsect damagewill trigger a transient increase in cytosolic ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ levels and that these second messengers active subsequent signalling pathways (Howe and Jander,2oo8;Lecourieux et al., 2006).

Plant WRKYs are involved in plant pathogen interactions (Pandey and Somssich，2oo9).In Arabidopsis thaliana，a mutant lacking the WRKY40 repressor results in exaggerated expression of some defense genes，such as enhanced disease susceptibility1 (EDS1)，AP2-type transcription factor，and JArelated genes (Pandey etal.，201O).WRKYs are activated by MAPK cascades，such as MPK3 and MPK6;both were upregulated after whitefly infestation,which is in accordance with previous reports (Kim and Zhang,2004; Skibbe et al.,2008).The majority of transcription factors identified in this report were suppressedafterwhiteflyinfestation，whichissimilarto V.dahliae infection suggesting that down-regulation of some gene networks might be required to modulate the plant immune signalling network (Xu et al.,2011).

Similarly,AOC4,which is involved in the JA synthesis pathway, isamajor candidate gene for BPH infestation of rice (Wang et al., 2012).Moreover，microarrays indicated that a large portion of wounding-and herbivory-induced responses are mediated by the JA pathway (Kempema etal.,2007;Reymond etal.,2004).Our results further showed the involvement of GA in defense responses to whiteflies.Our qRT-PCR data showed that BGL1 was up-regulated after whitefly infestation.In our previous report, over expression of BGL1 resulted in elevated free GA content in the transplastomic plant and caused an increase in N.tabacum trichome density,which may protect the plants from aphids and whiteflies (Jin et al.，2011).Mechanical woundingand insects activate MPK both locally and systemically in tomatoand N.attenuate (Wu et al.,2oo7).MAPKsarealso required for the accumulation of defensive metabolites (Hettenhausen et al., 2014).In this report,silencing MPK3and MPK6 by VIGS revealed that both kinases regulated the gene expression of WRKYs as well as genes in the JA and ET pathways,which highlights their central role in whitefly resistance.In summary,the complexity underlying expression of these genes illustrates the extraordinary interconnectedness of the signalling pathways regulated by phytohormones in response to whitefly infestation.

Interestingly, flavonoid metabolite-related genes,such as PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase)，TPS,F3H,DFR and CHS,were down-regulated during the later stage of whitefly infestation (48 h).
