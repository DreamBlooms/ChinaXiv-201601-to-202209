Screw pump has two major elements,a plain shroud which is a stationary element and a rotating hub with helical grooves contained within the shroud. In this paper, three variants of hubs with different number of thread starts numbering six, eight and twelve in combination with a plain shroud is studied.Each of the three possble combinations are analyzed on the basis of pressure rise developed,eficiencyand shaft power.It was seen that pressure rise,efficiency and shaft power increases as the number of threads increases in the range of mass flow rates studied.

Li and Hsieh [2] developed an analytical model for a screw pump which pumps highly viscous fluids and provided a more detailed prediction. The main assumption was that all inertial terms can be neglected since they are inconsequential compared to the viscous terms.Alves etal[3] further developed this analytical model by studying the flow inside the screw pump witha low viscous fluid.They used this analytical model to predict the flow for a screw pump supplying oil into reciprocating compressors [4].

When the number of threads in the hub is increased beyond 13,a significant drop in maximum absolute mass flow rate is observed. If the requirement of the problem was a mass flow rate less than, say $2 . 3 \\mathrm { k g / s }$ ,we would have chosen the hub with corresponding number of thread starts or less. Since we expect a mass flow rate of at least $2 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { k g / s }$ ，weshould choose hubs with thread starts less than 13.Hence thread starts numbering 6,8 and 12 were chosen in the present study.

So the pump should have a sufficient mass flow rate and should yet produce the maximum pressure rise working at the constant angular velocity. Recalling Fig 3,at this constant mass flow rate $( 2 . 3 \\mathrm { k g / s } )$ and angular velocity( $( 1 9 0 0 0 \\mathrm { r / m i n } )$ ,hub with 12 TS produces maximum pressure rise.But if we increase the number of threads in the hub keeping the mass flow rate constant, the pump will not produce enough pressure rise as it cannot produce that mass flow rate.From these two observations,it can be said that with a plain shroud, the optimum number of threads on the hub should be 12 in order to achieve the maximum pressure rise at a constant mass flow rate and the constant angular velocity.
