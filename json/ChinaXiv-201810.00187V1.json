        "text": "Abstract: Stable isotopes in tree-ring cellulose provide important data in ecological, archaeological, and paleoenvironmental researches, thereby, the demand for stable isotope analyses is increasing rapidly. Simultaneous measurement of cellulose $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ values from tree rings would reduce the cost of isotopic commodities and improve the analytical eficiency compared with conventional separate measurement. In this study,we compared the $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ values of tree-ring $\\alpha$ -cellulose from Tianshan spruce (Picea scbrenkiana) in an arid site in the drainage basin of the Urumqi River in Xinjiang of northwestern China based on separate and simultaneous measurements,using the combustion method (at $1 0 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ and the high-temperature pyrolysis method (at $1 3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $1 4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\$ . We verified the results of simultaneous measurement using the outputs from separate measurement and found that both methods (separate and simultaneous) produced similar $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ values. The two-point calibrated method improved the results (range and variation) of $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ values. The mean values, standard deviations, and trends of the tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ obtained by the combustion method were similar to those by the pyrolysis method followed by two-point calibration. The simultaneously measured $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ from the pyrolysis method at $1 4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ had a nearly constant offset with that the pyrolysis method at $1 3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ due to isotopic-dependence on the reaction temperature.However,they showed similar variations in the time series.The climate responses inferred from simultaneously and separately measured $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ did not differ between the two methods. The tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ values were negatively correlated with standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index from May to August. In addition, the $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ was significantly correlated with temperature (positive), precipitation (negative),and relative humidity (negative) from May to August. The tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ values determined simultaneously through the high-temperature pyrolysis method could produce acceptable and reliable stable isotope series. The simultaneous isotopic measurement can greatly reduce the cost and time requirement compared with the separate isotopic measurement. These results are consistent with the previous studies at humid sites,suggesting that the simultaneous determination of $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ in tree-ring $\\mathfrak { a }$ -cellulose can be used in wide regions.

These studies have greatly improved our understanding of the past environmental variation(Treydte et al., 2O07; Leavitt et al.,201O; Liu et al.，2017) and of the plant responses to the current environment or the changing climate (Saurer et al., 2O14; Altieri et al.，2015；Frank et al.，2O15). Recently， stable isotopes records in tree rings have been incorporated into isotope-enabled Earth system models to evaluate the large-scale mechanisms of Variation in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance under a changing climate and environment (Saurer et al.，2014; Keel et al.，2016；Keller et al.，2017).However, the veracity of the implementation of these models needs to be confirmed by a closer examination of regional and long-term isotopic chronologies in tree rings.

        "text": "The stable carbon isotope $( \\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathbf { C } )$ and stable oxygen isotope $( \\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O } )$ are traditionally measured separately. Unfortunately， high cost of sample preparation coupled with time-consuming analytical procedures are required to obtain a high level of replication and an adequate spatial coverage which are required for robust paleoclimatology studies and are difficult to achieve (Leavitt et al., 2O1O). Obtaining stable isotope measurements based on a long-term chronology is difficult due to the limited quantity of wood available in narrow tree rings from arid regions (Wang et al.， 2O13） and from archaeological studies (such as subfossil wood) (Klusek and Pawelczyk, 2014). Furthermore, when trends in two or more stable isotopes are viewed together, this can provide far greater insights into plant physiology and environmental responses than the stable isotopes that are considered separately (Loader et al. 2O15). For example,the relationship between $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ reflects a balance between plant carbon and water metabolism (Babst et al.,2014; Liu et al., 2014). Tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ mainly reflects the $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ of the source water and environmental humidity, whereas tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ reflects the variations in photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance (Farquhar et al.,1982;Roden et al.，2Ooo; Roden and Farquhar, 2012). Therefore， the combination of $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ could capture more environmental signals simultaneously than a single isotope,and could improve our understanding of the plant's physical response to climate change and of the terrestrial carbon cycle in relation to climate change (Scheidegger et al.,20O; Babst et al.,2O14).Thus,it would be beneficial to develop rapid and high-efficiency methods for a reliable stable isotope analysis by combining the two stable isotopes (i.e., $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ ） ",

Several comparative studies have reported encouraging results with this approach (Saurer et al., 1995; Knoler et al.，2005；Young et al.,2011; Woodley et al.,2012).

These large differences could have been due to potential errors in methods, such as preferential deposition of carbon atoms,exchange with the glassy carbon,and formation of carbon residues in the carbon tube because of some uncompleted pyrolysis (Young et al., 2O11). However, after we adopted the two-point calibrated method with two celluloses materials as standards, these errors were eliminated greatly because the two-point calibrated $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ had a smaller standard deviation and the slope of $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ from the two-point calibrated method and combustion method was closer to 1 (Fig.2b).

The $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C _ { \\mathrm { p i n } } }$ from the pyrolysis method enhanced the climatic signal strength of overall mean temperature, precipitation,relative humidity,and SPEI for the whole growing season (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C _ { \\mathrm { p i n } } }$ from the pyrolysis method does not greatly alter the interpretation of the climate response of tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ ",

Both of the two tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ series (from the pyrolysis method at $1 3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and from simultaneous measurement at $1 4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ ）showed significant correlations $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ with the overall mean temperature ( $_ { ( r = 0 . 5 4 }$ and $_ { r = 0 . 5 3 }$ , respectively), precipitation ( $r = - 0 . 4 2$ and $r { = }  { - } 0 . 4 4$ ,respectively), relative humidity $( r = \\ - 0 . 4 9$ and $r = - 0 . 4 9$ ，respectively）and SPEI（ $\\stackrel { \\cdot } { r } = - 0 . 5 1$ and $r = \\ - 0 . 5 4$ respectively） for the whole growing season (Fig. 4).

Taken together, our results indicate that the climate response of tree-ring $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ obtained from simultaneous measurement is the same as that from separate measurement, and therefore simultaneous measurement can be used as an alternative method for detecting the sable isotopic values ( $\\mathrm { 8 ^ { 1 3 } C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ ).These good results can be achieved due to the low loss of accuracy and the similar regional mean values and trends provided by the simultaneous measurement (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, for analysis of a regional tree-ring isotope network, the simultaneous measurement would greatly improve the number of sampling points that can be analyzed, and will therefore improve the regional coverage.

The simultaneously measured $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ values from the pyrolysis method at $1 4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ showed a nearly constant offset compared with the values from the pyrolysis method at $1 3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ because $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ depends on the reaction temperature.However, the variability of the $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ from simultaneous measurement was similar to that from separate measurement in the time series.The correlation of the stable isotope values with temperature and moisture variables indicates that simultaneous measurement will not change the inferred climatic signals.Based on the results mentioned above,we conclude that simultaneous measurement of the $\\delta ^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ and $\\delta ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ values in tree-ring $\\alpha$ -cellulose samples through high-temperature pyrolysis method would produce acceptable and reliable stable isotope series in both arid and humid areas.The simultaneous isotopic measurement can greatly reduce the cost and time requirement compared with separate isotopic measurement.
