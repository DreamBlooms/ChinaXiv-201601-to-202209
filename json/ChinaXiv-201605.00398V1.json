        "text": "Abstract Jasmonic acid (JA) and related metabolites play a key role in plant defense and growth.JA carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT) may be involved in plant defense and development by methylating JA to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and thus influencing the concentrations of JA and related metabolites.However,no JMT gene has been well characterized in monocotyledon defense and development at the molecular level.After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1，whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol，we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA. OsJMT1 is up-regulated in response to infestation with the brown planthopper (BPH;Nilaparvata lugens).Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oeJMT plants) showed reduced height and yield.These oe-JMT plants also exhibited increased MeJA levels but reduced levels of herbivore-induced JA and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JAIle).The oe-JMT plants were more attractive to BPH female adults but showed increased resistance to BPH nymphs, probably owing to the different responses of BPH female adults and nymphs to the changes in levels of ${ \\mathsf { H } } _ { 2 } { \\mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ and MeJA in oe-JMT plants.These results indicate that OsJMT1, byaltering levelsof JAand related metabolites,playsa role inregulating plant development and herbivore-induced defense responses in rice.

        "text": "Methylation,whichiscatalyzedbymethyltransferases(MTs), is highly conserved in plants and is essential for secondary metabolite modification,protein repair，signal transduction, and developmental and defense processes (Schubert et al. 2003; Qu et al.201o; Zhao et al.201o). On the basis of the atom to which the methyl group isattached,MTs are referred to as $\\mathsf { C } \\mathrm { - } , \\mathsf { N } \\mathrm { - } , \\mathsf { S } \\mathrm { - }$ ，and O-methyltransferases.The family of SABATH MTs,the name of which is derived from the names of three enzymes， salicylic acid methyltransferase， benzoicacid methyltransferase,and theobromine synthase (Ross et al. 1999;Murfitt et al. 200o;Qu et al. 2010),is a group of O-methyltransferases; these O-methyltransferases are specific to the methylation of carboxyl groups of small molecules and nitrogen atoms of some alkaloids.SABATH MTs are distinct from the other MTs in their sequence characteristics and protein structures (Qu etal.2o1o),and are involved in the methylation of several phytohormones,including jasmonic acid(JA)，salicylic acid(SA)，indole acetic acid，and gibberellins,all of which regulate plant defense responses and developmental and physiological processes (Seo et al. 2001; Pott et al. 2004; Effmert et al. 2005; Qin et al. 2005; Yang et al. 20o6; Koo et al. 2007; Varbanova et al. 2007). Methylation will change the activity，volatility and mobility of these phytohormones,and thus affects their biological functions.Silencing NtSAMT1 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.),for instance,decreases the level of methyl salicylic acid (MeSA) and blocks the plant's systemic acquired resistance (SAR) (Park et al.2oo7).Overexpression of OsBSMT (benzoic acid(BA)and SA methyltransferase(BSMT))in Arabidopsis reduces disease resistance; such plants have increased MeSA but decreased SA levels after pathogen induction,and MeSA alone cannot induce defense responses in the absence of SA (Koo et al. 2007).

        "text": "JA,one of the phytohormones that plays a central role in plant defense and growth (Howe and Jander 2oo8),can be methylated by jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT)，a member of SABATH MTs，to produce methyl jasmonate (MeJA) (Browse and Howe 2oo8).Like JA,MeJA has been reported to be involved in plant defense,develop ment and seed production (Kobayashi et al. 2o1o; Darras et al. 2011;Sampedro et al. 2o11; Yang et al. 2011). In many plant species,such as Arabidopsis and tomato,exogenouslyapplied MeJA induces resistance to spider mites，aphids，and nematodes (Rohwer and Erwin 201o; Fujimoto et al. 2011), although some studies suggest that this elicitation was mainly due to JA, the hydrolyzed product of MeJA (Wu et al.2008). The overexpression of AtJMT in Arabidopsis induces both the plant's constitutive expression of genes related to the biosynthesis of JAand its resistanceto Botrytis cinerea(Seo et al.2oo1).In contrast,AtJMT overexpression in Nicotiand attenuata does not change the expression levels of genes related to the biosynthesis of JA,but it does reduce induced JA and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-lle) levels and resistance to herbivores (Seo et al. 20o1; Stitz et al.201a). Furthermore, overexpressing AtJMT in rice plants increases MeJA and abscisic acid (ABA) levels,resulting in drought stress-induced phenotypes and loss of grain yield (Kim et al. 2oo9).These findings suggest that JMTs influence plant defenses against biotic and abiotic stresses by influencing the products of the oxylipin pathway,such asJAand MeJA,and this effect may be specific to individual plant species.However, to date,studies on JMTs have mainly focused on dicotyledons，and the function of JMTs in monocotyledon defense and growth remains largely unknown.

        "text": "Rice,one of the most important food crops in the world, suffers heavily from insect pests (Cheng and He 1996). Previous studies have shown that herbivore attack induces a variety of plant hormones in rice,such as JA,SAand ethylene. These subsequently regulate defensive responses, including the release of herbivore-induced plant volatiles(HiPVs)and the accumulation of trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TrypPls), polyphenol oxidase,and peroxidase (Lou et al. 2oo5a,2005b; Lu et al. 2006; Zhou et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2011; Xin et al. 2012; Ye et al.2012).The exogenous application of MeJA on rice elicits the production of TrypPls (Lu et al.2011). However， the biological functions of JMT genes in rice,especially the roles of these genes in plant defense,have not yet been elucidated. In this study,we isolated a rice JMT gene OsJMT1,which was induced after infestation with Spodoptera frugiperda larvae (Yuan et al.2oo8),and obtained rice transgenic lines that overexpress OsJMT1 (referred to as oe-JMT lines).We determined the role of OsJMT1 in rice development and grain yield as well as its function in plant defense by measuring herbivore-induced JA，JA-Ile，MeJA and ${ \\mathsf { H } } _ { 2 } { \\mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ levels，and resistance to a phloem feeder (brown planthopper (BPH); Nilaparvata lugens).The results indicate that OsJMT1 may affect rice development and herbivore defense by influencing JAand related metabolites.

Such signals have been identified in the eggs of the rice white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera，for example;these signals are lipids and can induce rice plants to produce benzyl benzoate,which in turn kills S. furcifera eggs (Yang et al.2013).

        "text": "Both JA and MeJA have been reported to regulate plant growth and seed production.Mutant Arabidopsis plants,for instance，that had decreased levels of JA or that were insensitive to JA (such as fad3-1/fad7-2/fad8 and coi1) had impaired floral development; inaddition,theabilityofmutant plants to release pollen was negatively affected (McConn 1996; Xie et al. 1998; Sanders et al. 20oo; Ishiguro et al. 2001). Similarly,the overexpression of AtJMT in Arabidopsis resulted in high MeJA levels but unchanged JA levels,as well as in decreased seed mass and seed number (Cipollini 2010). Moreover,rice with overexpressed AtJMT,which increased MeJAlevels but left its JA levels unchanged,induced high ABA levels and thus resulted in reduced grain yield and seedling height (Kim et al.2oo9).Therefore,as was found in rice overexpressing AtJMT (Kim etal.2oo9),the reduced growth and yield observedin oe-JMT lines may be related to these lines' low JA and/or high MeJA levels,especially the latter. Using different mutants with impaired or increased JA or MeJA levels may help researchers dissect the role of signals in both plant growth and reproduction.JMT has been shown to be expressed in reproductive organs and its expression is developmentally regulated (Seo et al.2oo1).Thus, to explore the mechanism underlying the OsJMT1 regulation of rice growth and reproduction，it will also be important to investigate the expression of OsJMT1 in different tissues andto determine whether the expression of OsJMT1 influences levels of JA and related metabolites in reproductive organs.

        "text": "In the BPH bioassay,we observed that BPH nymphs preferred WT plants to oe-JMT plants，whereas BPH female adults preferred oe-JMT lines to WT plants (Figure 5A-D).Moreover, BPH nymphs had a lower survival rate on oe-JMT plants than on WT plants (Figure 5E).These effects could result from: (i) theMeJA-elicited defense responses; (ii) the increased MeJA itself;(ii) the reduced $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } ;$ or(iv) the defense responses induced by signals in the JA pathway (JA-lle,for example) other than those elicited by MeJA.Recently,in N.attenuata,it has been found that MeJA itself isnota defense-related signal and that MeJA-induced resistance is elicited by JA(Wu et al. 2008).Thus, the first hypothesis can be ruled out.BPH nymphs were not sensitive to MeJA-treated WT plants (Figure 6E,F) but were repelled by oe-JMT plants treated with MeJA (Figure 6G-J). BPH female adults preferred oe-JMT plants to WT plants even when WT plants were treated with MeJA, whereas these insects preferred MeJA-treated WT plants or treated oe-JMT lines over their corresponding control plants (Figure 7C-E). Given that MeJA treatment increased MeJA levels in oe-JMT plants but not in WT plants(Figure S7)and that MeJA may not be a defense-related signal,we suggest that MeJA itself,a volatile chemical at ambient temperatures, is attractive to BPH female adults but repellent and/or toxic to BPH nymphs.The effect of MeJA on herbivores has also been reported in other plant-herbivore systems.Under wild conditions,for example,sagebrush produces high amounts of MeJA and is not attacked by mirids (Dinh et al.2o13). MeJA treatment may have increased MeJA levels only in oe-JMT plants,because the levels of JA and MeJA in WT plants are kept in balance by JMT and MJE (exogenous MeJA is hydrolyzed to JA by MJE).However，in oe-JMT plants,the balance is disrupted by the overexpression of OsJMT1; such overexpression methylates JA to produce and maintain high MeJA levels (Howe and Jander 2oo8). Hydrogen peroxide has a negative effect on survival rates,and on the feeding and ovipositing of BPHs (Zhou et al. 20o9; Lu et al.2011). Therefore, the lower elicited $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$ level in oe-JMT plants may also bea reasonwhy BPH female adults preferred oe-JMT plants overWT plants.Further research should elucidate these possibilities.
