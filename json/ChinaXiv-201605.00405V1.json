        "text": "AbstractFlowering isa highly orchestrated and extremely critical process in a plant's life cycle.Previous study has demonstrated that SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1(SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) integrate the gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathway and vernalization pathway in regulating flowering time,but detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. In GA signaling pathway, DELLA proteins are a group of master transcriptional regulators，while in vernalization pathway FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC） is a core transcriptional repressor that down-regulates the expression of SOC1 and FT.Here,we report that DELLA proteins interact with FLC in vitro and in vivo,and the LHRl domains of DELLAs and the C-terminus of MADS domain of FLC are required for these interactions. Phenotypic and gene expression analysis showed that mutation of FLC reduces while over-expression of FLC enhances the GA response in the flowering process.Further, DELLA-FLC interactions promote the repression ability of FLC on its target genes.In summary,these findings report that the interaction between MADS box transcription factor FLC and GRAS domain regulator DELLAs may integrate various signaling inputs in flowering time control,and shed new light on the regulatory mechanism both for FLC and DELLAs in regulating gene expression.

FLOWERING LOCUS T(FT） and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1(SOC1) are two major floral regulators that integrate both developmental and environmental cues into the floral genetic networks.They further activate a series of genes involved in the formation of floral meristems (Abe et al. 2005; Moon et al. 2005; Teper-Bamnolker and Samach 2005; Wigge et al. 2005).

        "text": "FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is another crucial floral regulator that integrates autonomous and vernalization pathways to fine-tune flowering time.FLC encodesa MADSbox transcription factor，which belongs to the family containing five other MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING (MAF) proteins (Michaels and Amasino 1999; Sheldon et al. 1999; De Bodt et al. 2003; Ratcliffe et al. 2003). FLC acts as a strong repressor of floral transition by direct binding to the promoters of several flowering time genes (SOC1 and FT) and repressing their transcription.The expression level of FLC quantitatively and reversely correlates with flowering time (Michaels and Amasino 1999; Sheldon et al. 1999). There are several regulatory pathways that converge to regulate FLC: the FRIGIDA pathway activates FLC expression,the autonomous pathway down regulates FLC，and vernalization epigenetically silences FLC in response to prolonged cold. All of these pathways involve a set of antisense transcripts, collectively named as COOLAIR (Swiezewski et al.2009; Hornyik et al. 2010; Liu et al.2010) and COLDAlR (Heo and Sung 2011; Hu et al.2o14). Epigenetic regulation of FLC by proteins and long noncoding RNAs in transcription levels have been extensively studied (Bastow et al. 2oo4; Sung and Amasino 2004;Margueron et al. 20o5; Sung et al. 20o6; Schmitz and Amasino 20o7; Choi et al. 2011; Heo and Sung 2011; Jeon and Kim 2011; Kim and Sung 2012). But whether FLC could be modulated by othermechanisms is still unclear.Recent ChiPseq results showed that FLC can bind to many other genes, indicating that FLC has other regulatory roles inaddition to repression of flowering(Deng etal.2o11).More interestingly, the active form of FLC is a high molecular complex of approximately 8oo kDa (Helliwell et al. 2oo6), indicating that more members probably take part in this complicated process by physically interacting with FLC.

GAs function through overcoming therepressive effects of the DELLA proteins (Richards et al. 2001).DELLA proteins including REPRESSOR OF GA(RGA),GA INSENSITIVE(GAI)，RGA-LIKE1 (RGL1)，RGL2 and RGL3，are nuclear localized transcriptional regulators that play pivotal roles in inhibiting GA responses (Sun and Gubler 2004). Bioactive GA binds to its receptor GA INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and enhances the interaction between GlD1 and DELLAs.This interaction induces the rapid degradation of DELLA proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Silverstone et al. 2oo1; Ueguchi-Tanaka et al. 2oo5; Griffiths etal.2006; Wilige et al.2o07). E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFSYi/GID2 promotes polyubiquitination of DELLAs in this process (McGinnis et al. 20o3;Sasaki et al.20o3;Dill et al. 2004; Fu etal.2oo4). GAs promote flowering through the activation of genes encoding the floral integrator SOC1,LEAFY(LFY) and FT (Mutasa-Gottgens and Hedden 2oo9).A recent study showed that the five DELLA proteins can repress flowering (Galvao et al.2o12). MiRNA159,which was negatively regulated by DELLA,represses MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN33 (MYB33) and thus controls the expression of LFY (Achard et al.2oo4). Further,it was reported that DELLAs interact with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE(SPL) to interfere With SPL transcriptional activity and affect flowering time (Yu et al. 2012). ",

One is that DELLAs act as repressors byinteracting with the DNA-binding domain of transcription factors mentioned above and inhibiting their DNA-binding abilities.Another one is that DELLAs interact with a negative regulator (such aS JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ)） to release its inhibition on the transcription factor (Hou et al. 2010).Recent studiesalso demonstrated that DELLAs interact with transcription factors (Such as BOTRYTIS SUSCEPTIBLE1 INTERACTOR(BOI)， GAI-ASSOCIATEDFACTOR1(GAF1), ABA-INSENSITIVE3(ABI3)，ABA-INSENSITIVE5(ABI5)，INDETERMINATEDOMAIN1(IDD1),DELLA INTERACTINGPROTEIN1 (DIP1)) and function coincidently with transcription factors to activate target gene expression (Lim et al. 2o13; Park et al. 2013; Fukazawa et al. 2014; Yoshida et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2014).

Elucidating the integrating mechanism of these pathways is vital for the understanding of how plants flower in response to diverse developmental and environmental signals. Previousstudies integrated FLCmediated vernalization and autonomous pathways with an FT-mediated photoperiod pathway as FT is a direct target gene of FLC that inactivates its transcription (Searle et al. 2006). GA and aging pathways are also interconnected by the interaction between DELLAs and SPL (Yu et al. 2012). Recent research places GATA transcription factors GNC and GNL downstream of GA signaling and upstream of SOC1,which may connect the photoperiod pathway with the GA signaling pathway (Richter et al.201o; Richter et al. 2013). It was reported that vernalization and GA pathways converge at regulating SOC1 expression,although the detailed molecular mechanism remains unknown (Moon et al.2oo3). In this study，we revealed that vernalization/autonomous and GA pathwaysare integrated throughadirect interactionbetween FLC and DELLAs,and such interaction is critical for robustly repressing SOC1 and FT gene expression (Figure 7A).Therefore,GA pathway induces floral transition in at least three parallel pathways,in which DELLA proteins interact with FLC, PIF-GNC/GNL or SPL transcription factors with an opposite effect: DELLAs enhance FLC activity but repress PIF-GNC/GNL or SPL function (Figure 7A).

In brief, DELLAs and FLC directly interact with each otherand probably function in a large complex,in line with the previous finding that FLC exists in an approximately 8oo kDa complex (Helliwell et al. 2006).Such a large complex may be required for a full inhibitory capacity to repress the target gene expression. GA induces the rapid degradation of DELLAs by 26S proteasome, resulting in the reduction (but not elimination） of the inhibition effect of the complex.Vernalization through a long period of cold exposure epigenetically silences FLC gene expression.In the absence of FLC，the complex loses its functional core and the repressive capacity,thereby flower ing-promoting genes are expressed and plants turn to flower. Future challenge is to ascertain what the additional proteins oreven non-coding RNAs are included in this complex and how this complex works. ",
