However, there are some drawbacks associated with reflectarray antennas,among which,narrow bandwidth is the most outstanding one.Narrow bandwidth performance of a microstrip reflectarray antenna is mainly due to two factors: first, the narrow bandwidth nature of the microstrip antenna element,and second, the differential spatial phase delays between the feed and elements in the reflectarray.For moderate-size reflectarrays the first factoris more significant to the bandwidth limitation [2].
