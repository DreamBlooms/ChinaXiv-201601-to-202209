Expression of some these proteins were verified using qRT-PCR and Western blot.The most significant change was cyclooxygenase-2(Cox-2). In addition to whole cell comparative proteomic study, we also compared lipid droplet (LD)-associated proteinsand identified that Cox-2 was one ofthree major altered proteins under the FA treatment.This finding was then confirmed using immunofluorescence.Finall, Cox-2 selective inhibitor,celecoxib protected cels from PA-reduced insulin signaling Akt phosphorylation. Together, these results not only provide a dataset of protein expression change in FA treatment but also suggest that Cox-2 and lipid droplets (LDs)are potential players in PA-and OA-mediated celular processes.

Collctively, these results demonstrate that Cox-2 is dramatically upregulated byPA treatment and this treatment results in increase expressionofCox-2 specifically atthe LDs in C2C12 cells.PA-induced Sqstml was reduced by OA and was primarilylocated in the TM faction, which was used as acontrol(Fig.4E).To verifythis finding,Myc-tagged Cox-2 was transiently expressd in C2C12cells and the cells were treated with diferent FFAs.After the treatments,immunofluorescence with anti-Myc antibody was conducted. Using LipidToxRed and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG to stain LDs and Cox-2 respectively, Myc-Cox-2 was found on LDs in PA-treated C2C12 cells (Fig.4F). ",

Only those proteins with alterations in expresson levels being greater than 2-foldor lessthan 0.5-fold,and quantified atleast twice in the three SILAC labeling experiments were considered as significantly changed.
