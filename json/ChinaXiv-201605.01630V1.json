Using high sensitivity measurements from the SupraThermal Electron instrument (Lin et al.2O08) on the STEREO,Wang et al. (2O12) reported that the power-law spectral index $\\delta$ of superhalo electrons observed during quiet-times near solar minimum ranges from $\\sim 1 . 5$ to $\\sim 3 . 4$ ,with an average of $\\sim 2 . 3 5 \\pm 0 . 4 5$ The observed density of superhalo electrons,about $1 0 ^ { - 9 } - 1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ of the solar wind proton density, decreases with the decay of solar cycle,while $\\delta$ has no solar-cycle variation. Since these superhalo electrons are present even in the absence of any solar activity (e.g.,active regions,flares,etc.), Wang et al. (2O12) suggested that superhalo electrons may be generated by wave-particle interactions in the interplanetary medium (IPM),or by nonthermal processes related to the acceleration of the solar wind.

Many researches have examined the charged-particle acceleration by magnetic reconnection in solar flares or the Earth's magnetosphere (e.g., Speiser 1965; Bulanov & Sasorov 1976;Bulanov 1980; Martens & Young 1990; Litvinenko & Somov 1993;Miler et al.1997; Mori et al. 1998; Browning & Vekstein 2001; Hamilton etal.2O03; Zharkova& Gordovskyy 2004; Wood & Neukirch 2005；Turkmani et al.2006;Cargillet al. 2006; Onofri et al. 2006;Liu et al. 2009；Drake et al. 2010; Gordovskyy et al. 2010; Oka et al. 2010;Kowal et al.2011；Li& Lin 2012；Bian & Kontar 2013; Leonardis etal.2Ol3).Speiser(1965)was the first to analyze the direct current (DC) electric field acceleration in the single reconnecting current sheet (RCS), by analytically solving the particle motion equations in the geomagnetic tail.Based on simulations with the single RCS in solar flare,Mori et al.(1998)obtained a power-law energy spectrum with the index of 2.0-2.2 for the accelerated protons,consistent with the theoretical prediction by Bulanov (1980); Wood & Neukirch (2005） got a power-law energy spectrum with the index $\\sim 1 . 5$ for the accelerated electrons in the reconnection outflow region.Moreover, Turkmani et al. (2006)and Cargillet al.(2Oo6) found a power-law distribution for the accelerated ions and electrons,from simulations with the stochastic development of transient RCSs. Onofri et al. (2O06) also suggested that the fragmented RCSs can be very efcient electron accelerator. Based on two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of multi-island reconnection, Drake et al.(2O10) and Oka et al.(201O) proposed that electron and ion acceleration is dominated by Fermi reflection in contracting and merging magnetic islands. However,the above models related to solar flares may not conform well to the superhalo electrons that are not correlated with flares.Due to their continuous presence in the PM,similar to the solar wind,these superhalo electrons could be produced by the magnetic reconnection related to the solar wind origin (Wang et al.

Moreover, the Fermi acceleration by reflection from contracting and merging magnetic islands could occur in the multiple X-line reconnection (Drake et al.2O10).As a result of the mismatch between the spatial and temporal scales of the MHD fields and those of electron motion,our MHD models are unable to address this Fermi acceleration; instead,the PIC simulation is usuallyused to study it (Drake et al.2010; Oka et al.2O1O). At the solar wind source region,however,the very smallion inertial length makes the PIC simulation subject to resolution constraints,reducing the possible physical box size that can be simulated to far below the length scale of the reconnection region.In future,we may also include PIC simulation to examine the influences of the Fermi acceleration by contracting and merging magnetic islands on the results presented here.

        "text": "Also,we can improve the model by taking into account the effects of Coulomb collisions at the Sun model would require simulations to be carried out on longer time scales.In simulations with collisions, Gordovskyy et al. (2O13) have found that the effect of colisions becomes dominant with time,since the source of acceleration (strong electric field) is transient and thus gradually disappears,while the source of energy losses (coulomb collsions) is always present.Therefore,at the early stage of reconnection,the energy spectra are rather similar to those obtained in simulations with no collisions,while at the later stage when electric fields are gradually decaying, the collisions become dominant.In our test particle simulation for the early stage of reconnection occurring at transition region, we will check the effects of Coulomb collisions on the acceleration of electrons,although such effects may be insignificant.In addition, during the interplanetary propagation,reflection by the interplanetary shocks (e.g., CIR shocks),and/or scattring by wave-particle interaction (e.g., Yoon et al.2012; Vocks et al.20o5),can isotropize the angular distribution of superhalo electrons,to form a nearly isotropic distribution observed at 1 AU.Also note that the evaluated flux and density of the accelerated electrons in the present model are based upon the value of acceleration efciency, which can be sensitive to various MHD model parameters, especially to the resistivity parameters.In future, we willconsider these respects,to compare the simulations and the observations in details.
