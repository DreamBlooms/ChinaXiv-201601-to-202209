The resolution capability of a phase conjugating lens has also been studied in [5]-[6]. In this work,we propose a basis matrix method applied in conjunction with the singular value decomposition (SVD） to achieve a sub-wavelength level of resolution in the context of microwave imaging problem using phase conjugation lens.We described the proposed method in detail and examined its abilities to resolve at the sub-wavelength level.

Finally,we extract a part of the image distribution,for instance its values along the $y = 0$ cut to form a column of the basis matrix.The number of the columns in this matrix corresponds to the number of possible positions for the PEC square in the source plane.
