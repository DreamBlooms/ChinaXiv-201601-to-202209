This paper explored to construct the logical principles and transmission mechanisms of the PSG and YB conservation and development, suggested to take the PSG as a better regulations and guidances for the sound development of the Yellow River Basin. Based on the data of Chinese Social Survey in 2019 (CSS2019),this paper tried to exam the PSG on YB Conservation and Development at the beginning of the national strategy. An evaluation index system including 5 factor dimensions and 25 evaluation indices was constructed,and the consistent processed methods of the raw data in CSS2O19 were developed.After that, the normal distribution of continuous distribution was used to describe the survey data,and the dominance matrix method was applied to make decision based on PROMETHEE II.The empirical results indicated that the PSG of the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River is lower than the overallevel of China,and the public in the Yellow River Basin were generally satisfied with government public services and social civilizations, except economic situations, living environment and individual self-fulfillments. Accordingly, some pertinent suggestions were put forward and some plans for further research were also explained. ",

The Yellw River Basin plays overall, strategic and fundamental roles in maintaining food security, energy security and ecological security,and it also plays great roles in ensuring national and regional sustainable development [2-3]. Meanwhile, the Yelow River is a rebellious disaster river. Since ancient times, frequent ice disaster, floods and droughts have brought serious disasters to the people along the river [4-7].Since the founding of new China, breakthroughs have been made in conservation and harness of the ecological environment in the Yellw River Basin. However, there are still some serious problems badly in need of solutions under the influences of global climate changes and human activities.For example, its ecological environment is still badly fragility, its water scarcity is geting worse,and its economic and social development is still relatively backward in general and so on [8-11]. Therefore,it has become a major challnge for Chinese government and people to further promote the harmonious development between protection and exploitation of the Yellow River [12]. Under such background, Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted a forum on \"ecological conservation and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin\" (Hereinafter referred to as “YB Conservation and Development\") in Zhengzhou on September 18, 2019 and delivered an important speech. At this forum, Xi Jinping pointed out that the protection of the Yellow River is a significant deployment for the great rejuvenation and sustainable development of the Chinese nation, he stressed that Chinese people should work together to protect and harnessthe Yellow River,and he issued a call \"to make the Yellow ",

The existing researches on YB Conservation and Development mainly includes two aspects,one is to interpret, understand, experience and reflect on this Chinese major strategy [14-15], the other is to contribute intelligences and suggestions for implementing this Chinese major strategy[1,16].For example, Liu etal. [17] took provincial region as research unit to evaluate the coupling coordination degree and the interactive response relationship between ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin; Under the guidance of important ideas such as sustainable development, harmony between humans and water and ecological civilization， Zuo et al.[18] constructed a research framework for selecting high-quality development path in the Henan section of the Yellw River Basin; Wang and Miao [19] organized an album on high-quality development of the Yellow River basin published in the Journal of Natural Resources, aimed at providing suggestions for the practice of urban-rural coordination,ecological protection,resource allocation,economic development and cultural inheritance in the Yellow River Basin. On the whole,the local governments at all levels,scholars and all walks of life in the Yellow River Basin are currently working together and striving to protect and harness the Yellow River and improve the quality of regional economic and social development.

The new concept fully reflects the new changings and demands of Chinese people's yearning for theirbeter life,and ithas soon become oneof the hot issues in various fields,the researchers have also been developing a lot of theoretical discussions and qualitative analysis around this concept [21]. Based on the empirical analysis of three ancient towns in Shanghai, Huang et al.[22] studied the evaluation and influence mechanism of rural development of ancient towns. Zhang and Liu [23] used the data of China's general social survey (CGSS) to measure the PSG on participation in basic medical insurance.Wen and Liu [24] researched the trends and disparities empirical analysis of the PSG based on Chinese urban and rural social governance dada. Wang et al. [25] researched on the factors of poverty subjects'acquired sense under the background of E-commerce poverty alleviation. Huang [26] explored the influential factors and boosting approaches of ecological sense of gain based on the essence of the sense of gain. Wang et al. [27] explored the mediating effect of community identity between socioeconomic status and sense of gain in Chinese adults by analyzing nationally representative samples of 28,300 adults from the China Family Panel Studies. Zuo et al. [28] took the Happy River Index (HRI) as an integrated index of river health and human well-being and established an HRI assessment framework for the Yellow River Basin. Besides,some researchers payed close attentions to the macro mechanism, evaluation system and evaluation methods of PSG[21,29-32]. However,for the concept of PSG, there have yet no consistent methods currently on scientific quantitative research, comprehensive mechanism investigation and temporal and spatial changes analysis. Especially, there are few published research achievements about the PSG on YB conservation and development at present. ",

Since the respondents who provided the survey data came from the same region and had their same concerns,the statistical histogram of the survey data of a certain index in the same region generally shows the characteristics of high in the middle and low at both ends,accordingly, it can be primarily concluded that the survey data of a certain index in the same region may obey normal distribution, $t { \\cdot }$ -distribution and log-normal distribution [39]. More importantly，it has been generally accepted that the human cognitions usually have the essence of fuzzy uncertainty， and the fuzzy membership function of normal distribution is the most suitable one to describe the human fuzzy cognitions [40-43]. In the large scale social survey, the respondents are often asked to provide accurate numbers (for example,any number in 1-10) to indicate their subjective cognitions for a certain evaluation object,and the accurate numbers sets are often strictly analyzed with mathematical statistics theory to draw some conclusions. Actually, the research methods on social survey data with rigorous statistical theory are not entirely reasonable，because the accurate numbers still represent the fuziness and randomness of the respondents'cognitions and responses，instead,the theories and methods of uncertainty decision-making can be tried， for example， the fuzzy and stochastic multi-criteria decision-making methods [44-45].

Secondly, the public in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River (A1) are generally the most dissatisfied with their individual and family economic situations,and the PSG about economic situations (E) of Henan and Shandong are also in the middle and lower levels.This's because，the Yellow River Basin has a relatively concentrated poverty-stricken population in China, and it involves 5of China's 14 contiguous poverty-stricken areas, which are mainly distributed in Henan and the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River [51], thus the public there are very eager to improve their individual and family economic situations and live a good life.Fortunately, the poverty allviation is one of the important contents of this Chinese major strategy for YB Conservation and Development, the PSG about economic situations will certainly be improved in the future.Thirdly, the PSG about living environment (L) of the three study regions in the whole Yellow River Basin are all in the middle and lower levels of their respective ranking lists. Since ancient times,the Yellow River has been both a “mother\"river and a “devil\" river,and the Chinese central and local governments have tried to harness and improve the Yelow River and gained lots of achievements,however, there are still many ecological and environmental problems affecting people's quality of life [9],and these problems are also included in this Chinese major strategy for YB Conservation and Development.Finally, the PSG about individual self-fulfillments (I) in Henan and Shandong are both at the bottom of their respective ranking lists,while it is at the middle level of their ranking list of the public in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River. The result suggests that the publc are generally dissatisfied with their individual self-efficiency， development opportunities and development capabilities, especially the people in Henan and Shandong,thus it should arouse the attentions of the local governments.
