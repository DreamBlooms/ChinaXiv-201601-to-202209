Among the studies, the reconfirmation of the vector-pseudoscalar (VP) decay puzzle (also called “pπ puzzle\"） between $J / \\psi$ and $\\psi ( 2 S )$ decays [2] first observed by MARK II [3] and the first observation of the $\\psi ( 2 S )$ decay suppressions in vector-tensor (VT） modes [4] compared to naive perturbative QCD predictions are of great interest.

Furthermore,the study of the old data may indicate $\\psi ( 3 7 7 0 )$ has a large fraction of decays into light hadrons besides $D D$ modes,in contradiction to the picture that it decays to $D D$ dominantly [8]. To confirm this, the best way is to measure the $D D$ and total $\\psi ( 3 7 7 0 )$ cross sections with high_precision， so that the difference between the two gives the contribution of the non- $D D$ decay rate, while the other possible way is to measure the exclusive non- $D \\bar { D }$ decay modes.

So in $e ^ { + } e ^ { - }$ experiment,any final state may come from three processes: the charmonium three-gluon decays, the charmonium one-photon decays, and the virtual photon process without going through resonance (continuum process). The study of the charmonium decay dynamics is to determine the decay amplitudes of the three-gluon and the one-photon processes. In the case of the $\\psi ( 2 S )$ ，the one-photon decays has a comparable cross section with respected to the continuum process. Moreover， for some strongly suppessed modes like VP and VT, the three-gluon process may also have a comparable cross section. In this case, one has to consider three amplitudes and the relative phases between any of the two amplitudes in the analysis of the experimental data.

The second reason is that our understanding of the hadronic problem is so crude that there is no need to worry about the electromagnetic corrections. In any case, if we find later on that it is necessary to do radiative corrections to the hadronic states for some specific problem, we can do the calculation then,because the initial state radiative corrections and final state radiative corrections can be decoupled to a large extent.

We studied the resonance and the electromagnetic processes. We also pointed out the possible uncertainty due to actual measurement circumstance. The electromagnetic final states of $\\omega \\pi ^ { 0 }$ and $\\pi ^ { + } \\pi ^ { - }$ are from two processes: one is $\\psi ( 2 S )$ （202 decay and the other the continuum contribution. Using form factors, we found the continuum contribution is equivalent to the previously reported cross sections of the resonance decay. This indicates that the actual branching ratios of these electromagnetic decays might be different from the present reported values. ",
