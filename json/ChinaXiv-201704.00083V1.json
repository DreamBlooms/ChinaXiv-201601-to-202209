Arora et al. [9] reported thatPS foamswithabimodal cell structure were produced through two-stage depressurization in a batch foaming process. Theresults showed that the large cells and the small ones were formed in the first and the second depressurization stage,respectively,and that the small ones were nucleated and grown within the cell walls of the formed large ones.However,this approach cannot be carried out in a continuous extrusion foaming process.Another method involves application of two different blowing agents to induce two foaming characteristics [7,8,11]. Lee et al.[7] prepared bimodal PS foams blown with $n$ -butane and water in extrusion. They reported that the formation of the small cells was attributed to the trapped water in the pore of silica(water carrier),while that of the large ones was mainly resulted from the excessive water and $n$ -butane.However,use ofa second blowingagent involvesa more complex process,and some blowing agents(e.g. $n$ -butane）were inflammable.

Doroudiani et al.[13] reported that the cell morphologyof polypropylene(PP)/high-density polyethylene(HDPE) blend foams was much finer and more uniform than that of neat HDPE and PP,although the blend foams showed no bimodal cell structure.By applying a one-step batch foaming process,Taki et al.

However,no bimodal cell structure was formed in their study,probably due to that PP could hardly be wellfoamed via a batch foaming process.Up to now,no intensive work has been reported on preparation of PP/PS blend foams with bimodal cell structure through continuous extrusion foaming.Based on the previous literatures [19,20], the solubility of ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ in PP and PS melts are quite different,and hence,the cell nucleation would be different in the two phases.Thereby,it is highly expected that the bimodal cell structure could be formed in PP/PS blends during continuous extrusion foaming.

        "text": "Aspreviously reported [27-29],the clay could significantly enhance the cell nucleation of polymer melts as a heterogeneous nucleating agent through lowering the nucleation energy barrier.Therefore,the clay was applied to PP,PS and the PP/PS blends at a content of $1 . 0 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ to investigate its effect on the cell structures of the foams,and the results are shown in Fig.11.By comparison of the results in Fig.11 and Fig.3,several findings were worthy ofbeing mentioned.First,the cell sizes of PP/clay foam (Fig.11a) and PS/clay foam(Fig.11b) were smaller relative to those of their counterparts without clay,due to the enhanced cell density with the incorporation of clay. Second, the decrease in cell size of PS/clay foam was more pronounced than that of $\\mathsf { P P } /$ clay foam. It was probably due to that the heterogeneous nucleation was more prominent for PS than PP with the application of clay.Based on a reported study[3O],PP has a high affinity for ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ ,and the high content of dissolved ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ could enhance its cell nucleation ability. When the applied $\\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ in PP melts reached $5 . 0 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ in content, the cell nucleation was mainly governed by ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ ,while slightlyaffected by the addition of a heterogeneous nucleating agent.In comparison,for PS,its cell nucleation ability was weaker due to its lower affinity for $\\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ .Thereby,the addition of clay could significantly improve the cell density ofPS foam than PP foam,and hence, the cell size was decreased more prominently for the former.Third, no bimodal cell structure was formed for PP/PS/clay foams (Fig.11c-f), and the cell sizes were similar forall the foams.It was interpreted that the cell nucleation density of PS phase was increased more than that of PP phase after incorporation of clay and thus the difference in cell nucleation between them was reduced to some extent where bimodal cell structure could not be able to form.For the cell size,Zhai etal.[31] reported that the heterogeneous nucleation by incorporation of nano-silica uniformized the originally broad cell size distribution of polycarbonate foam.Therefore,in this study, the cell sizes of the PP/PS blend foams could probably also be uniformized by the incorporation of clay as a heterogeneous nucleating agent.

Third,the difference incell density betweenPP phase and PS phase was significantly reduced.Therefore,the cell density data in Fig.12 could well support why no bimodal cell structure was formed in PP/PS foams with incorporation of clay.
