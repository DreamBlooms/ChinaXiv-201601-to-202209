Heterotrophic respiration was determined from vegetation-free trenched plots.Fertilization increased the above-to belowground biomass productionratio and the autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration ratio. The full C balance (incl. $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } ,$ （20 $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ and DOC fluxes from strips and ditches) was 96, 215 and $1 8 \\mathrm { { 0 } } \\ \\mathrm { g } \\mathrm { ~ C } \\ \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \\ \\mathrm { y r } ^ { - 1 }$ in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP,respectively,suggesting that all treatments acted as C sources during the dry year. The C balance was driven by variations in the net $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ exchange, whereas the combined contribution of $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ and DOC fluxes was $< 5 \\%$ . The GHG balances were 3.6, 7.9 and 6.6 t $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { e q h a } ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { y r } ^ { - 1 }$ in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively.

Overall, this study suggests that maximizing plant growth and the associated $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ uptake through adequate water and nutrient supply is a key prerequisite for ensuring sustainable high yields and climate benefits in RCGcultivations established on organic soils following drainage and peat extraction.

Increased plant growth and nutrient supply may,however,also alter the above- and belowground allocation of plant biomass and trigger structural changes in the belowground biomass due to its contrasting effects on root and rhizome production (Kätterer&Andrén,1999;Xiong&Kätterer,2010;Kinmonth-Schultz&Kim,2011;Jones etal.,2015).Furthermore,enhanced plant growth and changes in biomass allocation following fertilization may also modify the partitioning of the ecosystem $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ exchange into its component fluxes of gross and net primary production as well as soil heterotrophic and plant autotrophic respiration (Shurpali et al.，2008;Kandel et al.，2013).To date,detailedinformation of fertilization effects on biomass allocation and $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ balance partitioning is limited for perennial cropping systems; however， this knowledge is crucial to confidently predict variations in annual yields and the C cycle of bioenergy cropping systems on abandoned organic soils under future climate change and management scenarios (Strand et al., 2008;Gong et al.,2014; Jones et al.,2015).

Although individual studies have previously investigated the patterns and magnitudes of the different C balance components (Sundh et al.，2000; Shurpali et al.,2009;Strack et al.,2011;Hyvonen et al., 2013),a comprehensive assessment of all major C fluxes from both strips and ditches and their contrasting contributions to the full annual Cbalance in fertilized and nonfertilized RCG cultivations on organic soil is currently lacking.

Thus,while the contribution of the $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ exchange to the full C balance was negligible in these dry RCG systems, cultivation techniques which raise the WTL to sustain high biomass yields during dry years,for example, paludiculture(Wichtmann & Schäfer,2Oo7;Karki et al., 2014),might considerably increase the potential for $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ emissions in cultivated organic soils.

Overall, the combined contribution of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ and $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ emission from strips and ditches to the GHG balance was small $( < 6 \\% )$ during the dry year in this study.To some extent, this low contribution might be due to using the median when extrapolating $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ fluxes to the annual scale.Using the mean would have increased the contribution of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ $( 3 \\%$ 1 $6 \\%$ and $3 0 \\%$ ，respectively，for BP，RCG-C and RCG-F）as the mean is highly sensitive to the few extremely large peak emission rates measured in RCG-F and RCG-C. Given the highly non-normal distribution of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ fluxes, the choice of the median over the mean appeared therefore more reasonable. Nevertheless, the large uncertainty related to upscaling of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ fluxes in agricultural systems remains problematic and can only be reduced through measurements with high temporal (i.e., hourly to daily） resolution. In support of our findings,other studies also found a relatively small contribution of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ and $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }$ to the GHG balance of cultivated organic soils (Hyvonen et al.,2009; Shurpali et al.,2010;Mander et al.,2012;Karki et al.,2015a).We therefore conclude that the net $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ exchange determines both the C and GHG balances in RCG cultivations on organic soils. Management practices need to be therefore carefully evaluated with respect to their direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ exchange. ",
