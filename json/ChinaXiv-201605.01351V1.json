Tumor-infiltratingmacrophages are referred to astumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).Macrophage can differentiate into a classically activated phenotype (M1) or an alternatively activated phenotype (M2) in tumor tissues [1O-12]. M1 macrophages are characterized by the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,whereas factors produced by alternatively activated M2 macrophages act in favor of tumor progression [13].Although increased frequency of ${ \\mathrm { C D } } 6 8 +$ macrophages has been correlated with increased tumor size,lymph node metastasis,and TNM stage in lung carcinomas [14], CD68 is not a specific marker for M2 macrophages [10, 15].

        "text": "Accurate and early diagnosis of MPE is important and critical for immediate intervention and better prognosis [33,34]. Current methods of MPE diagnosis include imaging,cytological analysis,biomarker detection,needle pleural biopsy，and thoracoscopy[35，36].However, the false-negative rate is substantially high for these MPE diagnosis methods [37,38].Even though pleural effusion plays a crucial role in the spread of lung cancer, the contribution of cellular components in MPE is poorly understood. The role of $\\mathrm { C D } 1 6 3 { + } \\mathrm { C D } 1 4 { + }$ macrophages in the diagnosis of MPE is poorly characterized [39]. Therefore,in this study,we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of using $\\mathrm { C D } 1 6 3 { + } \\mathrm { C D } 1 4 { + }$ macrophages for diagnosis of MPE. The pleural effusions used in this study were derived from lung cancer patients.MPE induced by other types of cancer will be evaluated in ourfuture studies. ",
