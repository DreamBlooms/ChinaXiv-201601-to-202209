Methane was used as a fuel for combustion with air in the Bunsen-type burner.The data used for the reconstruction are from the optical signals of 8-laser beams passd on a cross-section of the methane flame.The performances of MART algorithm in data reconstruction were validated and compared with those obtained by Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) algorithm.

        "text": "For the measurement on the concentrations of the gases, there have been several representative pointwise techniques.Wang et al.[1] used a WAV (surface acoustic wave）type sensor to detect $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ andhumidity.Stemhagen et al.[2] used a WAV sensor to detect gas and temperature. Fine et al. [3] constructed a semiconductor-type sensor to detect CO, NOx, NH3 and $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ gases. Chen [4] proposed a thermal conductivity-type sensor for detection of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ gas.Dossi et al.[5] adopted an electrochemical-type sensor for $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 4 }$ gas.Since all of these conventional measurement techniques were based on pointwise measurements,the distribution of temperature or concentration can't be measured.As field-wise measurement techniques,Ko et al.[6] proposed a digital speckle method which allows for the measurements of spatial distribution of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration. Since gas concentration is affected by the gas temperature,temperature distribution should be measured to predict the gas concentrations.Deguchi et al.[7] proposed a technique which can quantify the concentration distributions of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ vapor by measuring the temperature distribution of a gas flame.They used a tunable laser and introduced 2-dimensional array of the laser beam,inwhich8laserbeamlineswere installedand the intensityofthe laserlines were sensedby8 detectors (photodiode). The intensity signals from 8 detectors were used to reconstruct the spectrum patterns of a gas.They used the ART (algebraic reconstruction technique）[8] method for reconstructing the concentration and temperature fields.In the meantime,Doh et al.[9] developed a tomographic PTV (particle tracking velocimetry）in which spatial distribution of velocity vectors are obtained from a set of tomography images that were reconstructed by the MART (multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique) method.In this study,it was known that the MART algorithm allows less calculation load and less calculation errors than the ART algorithm.In this study, performance of the MART algorithm is shown by using the experimental data obtained by the Deguchi group [7].
