Besides the high aboveground biomass production, these bioenergy grases also exhibit extensive root systems.The decomposition of root biomass greatly influences nutrient cycling and microbial activity and subsequentaccumulationof carbon (C)in thesoil.The objective of this research was thus to characterize root morphological and chemical diferences in six perennial grass species in order to better understand root decomposition and belowground C cycling of these bioenergy cropping systems. Giant reed (Arundo donax), elephantgrass(Pennisetum purpureum), energycane (Saccharum spp.)，sugarcane (Saccharum spp.)， sweetcane (Saccharum arundinaceum),and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus $\\times$ giganteus) were established in Fall 20o8 in research plots near Gainesville,Florida.Root decomposition rates were measured in situ from root decomposition bags over 12 months along with initial and final root tissue composition. Root potential decomposition rate constant $( K )$ （204号 was higher in elephantgrass $( 3 . 6 4 ~ \\mathrm { g } ~ \\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } ~ \\mathrm { d a y } ^ { - 1 } )$ and sweetcane $( 2 . 7 \\bar { 7 } \\mathrm { ~ g ~ k g } ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { ~ d a y } ^ { - 1 } )$ than in sugarcane $( 1 . 6 2 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ $\\mathrm { k g ^ { - 1 } \\ d a y ^ { - 1 } } ,$ ）and energycane $( 1 . 4 8 ~ \\mathrm { g ~ k g } ^ { - 1 } ~ \\mathrm { d a y } ^ { - 1 } )$ . Notably, $K$ was positively related to initial root tissue total C (Total C),total fiber glucose (TFG),total fiber xylose(TFX),and total fibercarbohydrate (TFC)concentrations, but negativelyrelated to total fiber arabinose (TFA）and lignin (TL）concentrationsand specificrootvolume (SRV).Among the six species,elephantgrass exhibited root traits most favorable for fast decomposition: high TFG,high TFX,high TFC,high specificroot length (SRL)and a low SRV,whereas giant reed,sugarcane,and energycane exhibited slow decomposition rates and the corresponding root traits.Thus,despite similar aboveground biomass yields in many cases, these species are likely to diffrentially affct soil C accumulation.

The decomposition of plant tissues,particularly belowground pools,is an important process that affects soil microbial activity and C accumulation (Six et al.,200o;Jones & Donnelly,2004;Rasse et al.,20o5).As the main source of C inputs to the soil, the quantity and quality of root and rhizome biomass influences their decomposition rate and their residence time with subsequent impacts on C stored in the soil (Fontaine et al.,20o7;Hättenschwiler & Jorgensen,2010; Amougou et al.,2011; Knoll et al.,2012; Sun et al.,2013).

In addition,herbaceous species root morphological attributes such as specific root length (SRL） have been positively correlated with root decomposition rate (Aulen et al., 2012).In a 4-year experiment with temperate tree species，root decomposition rates differed among root diameter classes (e.g., $< 0 . 5$ and $0 . 5 { - } 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ (Sun et al., 2013).In contrast,Birouste et al. (2012) found no correlation between initial SRL or diameter and decomposition rates. Consequently, there are conflicting reports in the literature on the effects of root chemistry and morphology on root decomposition rates,and the complexityisprobably due tothe interaction ofroot characteristics and environmental factors.

Previous studies have commonly focused onplant tissue C:N ratios,which were often negatively correlated with decomposition rate as described in Zhang et al. (2oo8). However，decomposition is more complex,and rates of decomposition are not necessarily related to C:N ratio,but they can be influenced by a number of factors such as environmental conditions, decomposer composition，other root chemical components，and physical structure (Table 5) (Johnson et al., 2007;Birouste et al.,2012; Smith et al.,2014).

The positive correlation between TFC and $K ,$ and in particular, TFG and $K ,$ could be explained by energy dominance.Decomposer activity during bio-decomposition is mainly controlled by the energy that can be supplied by substrates contained in the litter (Fioretto et al.，2005; Hättenschwiler & Jorgensen,2010). Compared with lignin,cellulose is an energy-rich compound.Thus，the faster decomposition of elephantgrass roots in the present study could be because of their relatively higher celuloseconcentrationandcellulose:ligninratio compared withthe otherspecies.

The TFC and TFG provided sufficient energy to decompose more recalcitrant compounds similar to the priming effect seen with root exudates and finerootturnover (van der Krift etal.,2002; Fioretto et al.,2005;Talbot& Treseder,2012).

In the present study, elephantgrass possessed the highest initial TFC concentration among all the grasses,but its initial TL was similar to other species except for giant reed (Table 2).Its high initial TFC concentration probably stimulated or primed lignin decomposition，which resulted in relatively low amounts of both TFCremaining $( 1 6 \\% )$ and TLremaining $( 2 6 \\% )$ after the 12-month field incubation. On the other hand,giant reed had at least $5 0 \\%$ of both TFC and TL remaining after the incubation.Consequently，a relativelyhigh TL and/orhigh TL:TFC reduced $K$ by slowing the loss of hemicellulose and cellulose as well as lignin,implying that lignin may have protected the cell wall from degradation (Fioretto et al.，2Oo5;Talbot & Treseder,2012).

        "text": "Besides the physical protection of more easily decomposable components (i.e.,cellulose and hemicellulose), the recalcitrance of lignin is related to its chemical characteristics,such as molecule size,polarity,three-dimensional structure,and functional groups (aromatic ring structures）(von Luetzow et al.，2Oo6;Puttaso et al., 2011;Gul & Whalen,2013). Once plant tissues start to decompose, lignin begins to incorporate N,and condensation reactions take place (Berg& McClaugherty, 2008).These chemical transformations could cause changes in structures that are resistant to degradation by soil microbes and also act as barriers limiting their access to the more labile compounds.High N concentrations also suppress the formation of ligninase (Berg & McClaugherty，20o8) and may help to explain why a positive correlation was found between $\\mathrm { T L } _ { \\mathrm { r e m a i n i n g } }$ and N，which was consistent with the previous findings, especially in lignin-rich plant tissues (Hobbie,2ooo;Perakis et al.,2012).Also,because of the protection of lig nin，degradation of TFC could have been retarded, leading to the positive correlation between remaining TFC and N (Table 4).

        "text": "Root morphological traits represent the economics of root investment: carbon input for root growth vs. the capacity of resource acquisition (Donovan et al.， 2014; Reich,2014). Their correlations with root decomposition rate reflect their potential in C and nutrient cycling across ecosystems (Donovan et al., 2014). In the present study，morphological traits associated with fast root decomposition were high SRL and,even more so,low SRV roots (Fig.3;Table 5). These findings were in agreement with other studies that have shown SRL to bepositivelycorrelatedwith decompositionrate because a high SRL has the potential to facilitate decomposition through maximizing root surface area and exposure for bio-decomposition (Aulen et al.,2012; Birouste et al.，2012;Donovan et al.，2014;Smith et al., 2014).In addition, the present study identified correlations between root morphological and chemical traits, such as the positive correlation between TLremaining and SRV (Table 4)，and the negative correlations between TL，SRL,and SRA (Table 5).Root diameter has also been shown to affect root decomposition rates among switchgrass cultivars (de Graaff et al.，2013)，which could be related to different concentrations of soluble carbohydrates and lignin in different root diameter size classes (Fan & Guo,201O).However,interactive effects of root morphological and chemical traits on root decomposition have not been investigated thoroughly in the previous research. Varied morphological and chemical traits of plant species are determined by both genetic and environmental components. The interaction of root morphological and chemical characteristics, thus, might play an important role in root decomposition under different environments.For instance,after similar time periods of decomposition in the field, the remaining root biomass of the same species can differ greatly under varied environments (Harmon et al., 2009).

        "text": "Overall, perennial grass species, many of which possess similar aboveground annual biomass production, differed substantially in root morphological and chemical traits,and these traits were closely correlated with their decomposition rates.In the context of C flux across ecosystems,root biomass (i.e., quantity and quality) and its decomposition rate are among the most important factors governing soil C dynamics (Aerts et al., 2003; von Luetzow et al., 2006). Although the processes controlling belowground C translocation and allocation of rootderived C into soil are complex,more organic matter input from roots combined with greater microbial activity are presumed to lead to more C transfer and storage in the soil (Kuzyakov & Domanski, 20o0; Puttaso et al., 2011).However, the quality of root-derived C inputs can also play a dominant role in the transfer of root biomass to soil organic C. Despite a lack of consensus in the literature,most recent studies suggest that high-lignin materials cannot be used efficiently by the soil microbial community，and high-lignin materials thus contribute less to soil organic C than materials with low lignin concentrations (Hancock et al.,2007; Cotrufo et al.,2013; Stewart et al.，2015). Additionally，introducing readily available organic matter into soils initially brings up priming effects,which causes soil organic C loss through promoted microbial metabolisms (Brzostek et al.,2015; Stewart et al.，2015). However, the negative effects of root-derived C inputs on soil C stocks are generally transient and more pronounced in the rhizosphere (Haichar et al.,2014).As evidenced in previous studies, the extent that root-derived C affects soil organic C in bioenergy production systems is expected to vary considerably depending on soil， plant，and environmental factors (Bandaru et al., 2013; Bonin & Lal, 2014). Thus,changes in soil organic C can be expected to differ between bioenergy grasses. For example,after conversion of native land to miscanthus, soil organic C was building up slowly over time, whereas the conversion to sugarcane caused a large initial loss of soil organic C in the top soil, and the loss could last for a few decades before soil organic carbon rebuilds (Anderson-Teixeira et al.,2009). Such interspecies differences in soil organic C could be related to the characteristics of root chemistry and morphology indicated in the present study.For instance, giant miscanthus and giant reed showed slow root decomposition rates,implying a slow increase in soil organic C.In contrast,elephantgrass roots exhibited all the root traits favorable for fast decomposition: high TFG,high TFC,high SRL,and a low SRV,and elephantgrass could thus be expected to contribute to soil C accumulation in a rapid way.
