        "text": "Miscanthus is a promising fiber crop with high potential for sustainable biomass production fora biobased economy.The effect of biomass composition on the processing eficiency of miscanthus biomass for different biorefinery value chains was evaluated,including combustion,anaerobic digestion and enzymatic saccharification for the production of bioethanol. Biomass quality and composition was analyzed in detail using stem and leaf fractions of summer (July)and winter (March) harvested biomass of eight compositionally diverse Miscanthus sinensisgenotypes. Genotype performance in tests for enzymatic saccharification，anaerobic digestion and combustion differed extensively. The variation between the best and the worst performing genotype was $1 8 \\%$ （204号 for biogas yield $( { \\mathrm { m l ~ g } } ^ { - 1 } { \\mathrm { ~ d m } } )$ and $4 2 \\%$ for saccharification efficiency (glucose release as $\\% \\mathrm { d m } \\mathrm { , }$ .Theash content of the best performing genotype was $6 2 \\%$ lower than that of the genotype with the highest ash content and showed a considerably high ash melting temperature during combustion.Variation between genotypes in biomass quality for the diferent thermochemical bioconversion processes was shown to be strongly correlated to diferences in biomass composition.The most important traits that contributed favorably to biogas yields and saccharification efciency were a high content of trans-ferulic acid,a high ratio of para-coumaricacid to lignin and a low lignin content.Additionally,a high content of hemicellulosic polysaccharides positively affected saccharification eficiency.Low contents of ash and inorganic elements positively affect biomass quality for combustion and low potassium and chloride contents contributed to a higher ash melting temperature. These results demonstrate the potential for optimizing and exploiting M.sinensis as a multipurpose lignocellulosic feedstock, particularly for bioenergy applications. ",

It is a perennial C4 grass characterized by high annual biomass yields and a high resource-use efficiency (Long et al., 2oo1;Lewandowski etal.,2003b;Heaton etal.，2004,2008;VanDerWeijde et al.,2013).Given its potential asa high yielding,lowinput lignocellulosic feedstock, there is growing interest in the use of miscanthus biomass for a plethora of applications,in particular the production of bioenergy and biofuels (Brosse et al.,2012).Applications of lignocellulosic biomass are manifold,and three important bioenergy conversion routesinclude direct combustion, anaerobic digestion to produce biomethane and enzymatic saccharification and fermentation to produce bioethanol. The chemical composition and structure of cell walls play an important role in biomass quality for each of the aforementioned processes.Therefore,optimization of chemical composition and physical structure are envisioned to improve the process eficiency, which will subsequently contribute to the feasibility and economic success of bioenergy conversion technologies (Wyman,2007; Torres et al.,2016).

        "text": "There are different options to optimize and improve thebiomassqualityto facilitatethe respective thermochemical conversion processes. Improved biomass quality can be achieved through breeding for quality traits. Currently, biomass quality is an important breeding objective in bioenergy crops such as miscanthus (Hodgson et al.,201o; Van Der Weijde et al.,2013). Another option is to improve biomass quality through 'on field quality management practices' such as fertilization and harvest time(Lewandowski& Kicherer,1997; Lewandowski & Heinz， 20o3; Lewandowski et al., 2003a; Iqbal & Lewandowski, 2014).However, intrinsic differences between the distinct conversion routes result in route-specific requirements on biomass quality,either because they target other plant components or use another process to convert them into products.Lignin, for example, negatively affects the efficiency of biological conversion routes,such as fermentation or anaerobic digestion (Jergensen et al.，2007；Wyman，2007；Zhao et al.,2012),but has a favorable influence on the heating value of biomass for direct combustion (Lewandowski & Kicherer,1997).Furthermore,for most bioconversion processes，the route-specific biomass quality requirements are not yet clearly defined due to a number of reasons.First of all，most bioconversion processes are not yet mature technologies and still need to be optimized.A second reason is that we do not yet fully understand the complex structure of lignocellulose and how it affects different bioconversion processes. The final reason is that biomass recalcitrance factors have evolved over a long time to protect the plant against environmental threats and we are now challenged to find ways to manipulate biomass recalcitrance without adversely affecting plant performance (Himmel et al., 2007; Zhao et al.,2012).

The genotypes were propagated in vitro to generate enough plantlets for setting up the trial. The trial was managed without irrigation,fertilization,pest, or weed control.The field trial had a design with four randomized blocks of eight plots. Plots had a size of $9 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ and contained 16 plants.All plots were surrounded by two rows with medium-sized M.sinensis plants to minimize possible border effects.Plant spacing between and within rows was $7 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ .In the establishment year,the trial was harvested (March 2014),but no samples were taken for analysis.After the establishment year,two different harvest regimes were imposed on the trial: Two of the four blocks were randomly assigned to be subjected to a double-cut harvest regime and the other two blocks were subjected to a single-cut harvest regime. The single-cut harvesting regime involved a cut in March 2015,referred to as ‘winter cut'.The double-cut harvesting regime involved a green cut in mid-July 2014,referred to as 'summer cut' and a harvest of the regrowth in March 2015, referred to as ‘regrowth cut',which coincided with the winter cut of the single-cut harvesting regime.At the time of the summer cut, genotypes OPM-42, 49 and 87 were already flowering, whereas the other genotypes were still in the vegetative phase.

Good combustion quality pertains to low ash content and a high ash melting point. Considerable genotypic variation in potassium and chlorine contents was found (Tables 5 and 6).This is in agreement with the large genotypic variation for elemental composition reported forM.sinensis (Atienza et al.,2oo3a,b).The classification of genotypes in ash fusion classes showed that the ashes of some genotypes (OPM-49 and OPM-65) were still only partly sintered at a combustion temperature of $1 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ whereas ashes of another genotype (OPM-48) at the same temperature were already completely molten (Tables 5 and6).OPM-65was shown to have a $6 2 \\%$ lower ash content and was consistently classified in a lower ash fusion class during combustion than OPM-48, which is indicative of a higher ash melting point.

One such trait was found to be Hem,which positively contributed to saccharification efficiency $( r = 0 . 7 4 ,$ ,Figs 2d and 3),but not to biogasyield.Torres et al. (2014) showedthat digestibility in rumen liquid (an anaerobic digestion process) and saccharification eficiency have many communalities,but a critical difference was that degree of hemicellulose substitution was relevant for saccharification efficiency,but not a major determinant for rumen liquid digestibility;a digestion process that resembles the process of anaerobic digestion for biogas production.This is also shown by the fact that the relative quality rating of the genotypes differed for anaerobic digestion and saccharification processes,with the best genotype for biogas production (OPM-73) being one of theworst for saccharification (Table4).However,there were also genotypes that performed well in both platforms (for example,OPM-65)，which indicates that it might be possible to improve biomass quality for both anaerobicdigestion and enzymaticsaccharification simultaneously.

Lignin is mainly deposited after plant cells stop growing，when cell walls no longer need to accommodate cell expansion and become rigidified by lignification (Lam et al.，2013;Da Costa et al.，2014). Other factors that contributed to the higher conversion efficiencies of biomass of the summer cut are the facts that the relative weight ratio of leaves to total biomass washigher in the summer cut (Table 2),and that leaves were shown to have lower lignin contents in the summer cut then stem fractions (Fig.1d).Despite higher conversion efficiencies,summer harvesting of miscanthus was shown to have a considerable and negative impact on total annual harvestable biomass yields，as the accumulated yield of the summer cut and the regrowth cut achieved only $\\pm 4 0 \\%$ of the yield achieved in the winter cut (Table 2).Like for the genotypes evaluated in this study,a low tolerance to early green cuttings in July and August was also reported for M. x giganteus.However，a green harvest in October was shown to have less detrimental effects on crop yield, while beneficially affecting biomass quality for biogas production compared to winter harvesting (Kiesel & Lewandowski, 2016).

In addition,due to natural drying on the field during winter, the dried stems and leafs are more easily fractured by wind,which facilitates the leaching of inorganic elements in periods of rain. The low ash contents in samples of biomass from the winter cut compared to the corresponding samples from the summer cut favorable affect combustion quality (Tables 3 and 4).Moreover,itis known that lignin has a higher caloric value than cellulose and hemicellulose (Lewandowski &Kicherer,1997) and samples harvested from the winter cut were shown to have higher lignin contents (Tables 3 and 4,Fig.1d).Ash melting behavior could also be optimized.It was shown that potassium and chlorine were associated with lowering the ash melting point and that low contents of these elements positively affect combustion quality (Table 7).The relative quality rating of genotypes for combustion quality differed for some genotypes from that for biogas or for saccharification，but notably there were as well geno types that performed well in all conversion platforms, such as OPM-49 and OPM-65.However, these were not the highest yielding genotypes. The highest yielding genotype (OPM-69） on the other hand unfortunately tended to slag and had higher contents of Cl and $\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathrm { K } , } \\end{array}$ resulting in a low quality for combustion. These results show that it is possible to optimize biomass quality for different utilization options simultaneously and develop multipurpose genotypes,but that several quality traits need to be cross-bred.Extensive genetic variation for many biomass quality traits was found in the eight M.sinensis genotypes evaluated in this study,but it is likely that the full extent of variation for these traits within the species is even broader. The exploitation of such variation through breeding will greatly accelerate the realization of biomass derived energy and fuel production,as well as many other biobased applications, generating many market options for the use of miscanthus biomass.
