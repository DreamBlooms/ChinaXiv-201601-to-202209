Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OslAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2)，a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase，directly regulates the stability of OslAA11. NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OslAA11.The Irt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OslAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OslAA11 protein. Moreover, knockdown of the OslAA1 expression partially rescues the Irt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development.Together, these results illustrate cyclophilincatalysed peptidyl-prolyl isomerization promotes Aux/IAA degradation,as a mechanism regulating auxin signalling.

In response to specific developmentalorenvironmentalcues， auxinpromotes the formation of a..co-receptor complex consisting ofa ubiquitin-ligase SCFTIRi/AFBand Aux/IAAs (refs4-6).The auxin-dependent formation of the ${ \\tt S C F } ^ { \\mathrm { T I R 1 } }$ -Aux/IAA complex results in the ubiquitinationofAux/IAAs,which are subsequently subjected todegradation through the 26Sproteasomal degradation machinery.

LRT2 encodes a _putative cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase） that catalyses the isomerization of peptide bonds at proline residues to specifically regulate protein conformational changes. The PPIase superfamily in higher eukaryotesincludescyclophilins(CYP)，FK506-binding proteins， parvulins and PP2A phosphatase activators18,19. In plants,cyclophilin-like genes have been identified froma variety of species, including both Arabidopsis and $\\mathrm { r i c e } ^ { 2 0 - 2 2 }$ .

However, how the cyclophilin-type PPIases function in auxin signalling remains unknown.Here we show that rice LRT2/ OsCYP2 acts as a functional cyclophilin to catalyse the peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerization of the OsAux/IAA transcriptional repressors,thereby facilitating their binding to OsTIR1 for subsequent_ proteasomal degradation and eventually activating auxin signalling.

In agreement with this notion,LRT2/OsCYP2 was found to directly interact with OsSGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of skp1)17, whose Arabidopsis homologous gene AtSGT1b was identified from a genetic screen for the enhancers of tirl-1 and_was characterized as co-chaperone to be required for the ${ \\tt S C F } ^ { \\mathrm { T I R 1 } }$ ， mediated degradation ofAux/IAA proteins39. Moreover, mutations in the Arabidopsis SIR1 gene,which encodes a protein sharing homology with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase,cause an auxin hypersensitive phenotype, thus providing an additional line ofgenetic evidence supporting a regulatory role of conformational changes on Aux/IAA proteins40.Evidence presented in this study demonstrates that LRT2 modulates the cis/trans isomerization exchanges of OsIAA11 and,possibly, OsIAA13. Two lines of evidence suggest that LRT2 may also target other OsAux/IAA proteins.First,LRT2 interacts with all the tested OsAux/IAA proteins in the luciferase complementation assay,suggesting that these OsAux/IAA proteins are potential targets of LRT2. Second，the knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression only partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype, implying that other downstream factors are likely involved in the LRT2-mediated auxin signalling. In this regard,LRT2 protein mayregulate a larger repertoire of OsAux/IAA transcriptional repressors. ",
