The random stepping of carrier frequencies is controlled by a combination chaotic map (CCM), which is generated by embedding a Logistic map into a Bernoulli map. The baseband noise signal adopts the CCM based frequency-modulation (CCM-FM) signal, which has good randomness and a thumbtack ambiguity function as well. The velocity estimation includes a coarse search and a precise search, where the coarse search is conducted with a fixed step to makes the velocity deviation less than the velocity resolution， while the precise search adopts the Golden Section Search (GSS) algorithm to get an accurate estimation of velocity. What should be emphasized is that the velocity estimation process can be completed with just a burst of subpulses. Then the spectra are coherently synthesized to obtain ultra-wide bandwidth and high-resolution range imaging. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate a good performance of the proposed signal model and the processing algorithm. ",

To obtain ultra-wide synthesized bandwidth while keep low instantaneous bandwidth，stepped-frequency signal is proposed [8,9]. But the size of frequency step restricts the non-ambiguity range interval [10]，so it may suffer from ambiguous peaks，known as“grating lobes”[1l.To overcome this drawback，researchers proposed stepped-frequency Chirp signal (SFCS), which consists of narrow-band sub-chirps with linearly increased/decreased carrier frequencies [12-14],but SFCS is susceptible to coherent jamming [15,16]. After that, Chirp signal is replaced by noise signal, soas to obtain the stepped-frequency noise signal (SFNS) [17],which can further elevate the anti-jamming capability. ",

Compared with traditional noise signals, chaotic signal is much easier to generate and control, also the cost is lower [23,24]. ",

It has been shown in [25] that using digital devices, e.g.,FPGA chip,to real-time generate chaotic noise signals is a good choice. However, the quantization length is usualy very low in FPGA [26], which may destroy the chaotic property. Therefore，we proposed the combination chaotic map (CCM), which is insensitive to the quantization and can keep good chaotic property even though the quantization length is low [25,27]. The stepping of carrier frequencies is controlled randomly by a CCM sequence and the baseband noise signal adopts the CCM based frequency-modulation (CCM-FM) signal [27]. ",
