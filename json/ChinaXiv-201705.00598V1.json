        "text": "ABSTRACT: In this paper， stainless steel meshes with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic surfaceswere fabricated by rapid and simple one-step immersion in a solution containing hydrochloric acid and stearic acid. The apparent contact angles were tested by a video contact angle measurement system (CA). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)， and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted to characterize the surface topographies and chemical compositions. The SEM results showed that mesh surfaces were covered by ferric stearate $\\left( \\mathrm { F e } [ \\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } ( \\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 } ) _ { 1 6 } \\mathrm { C O O } ] _ { 2 } \\right)$ with low surface energy. The CA test results showed that the mesh had a maximum apparent contact angle of $1 6 0 \\pm 1 . 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and a sliding angle of less than $5 . 0 ^ { \\circ }$ for the water droplet, whereas the apparent contact angle for the oil droplet was zero. Ultrasound oscillation and exposure tests at atmospheric conditions and immersion tests in 3.5 wt $\\%$ NaCl aqueous solution were conducted to confirm the mesh with excellent superhydrophobicandsuperoleophilic properties.Onthebasis of thesuperhydrophobic mesh,aminiatureseparation devicepump was designed tocolect pureoilfrom theoil/water mixture.It showed thatthe device was easierandconvenient. The techniques and materials presented in this work are promising for application to wastewater and oil spil treatment. ",

Stability of the Obtained Mesh and Its Application for Oil/Water Separation.The mesh with pore sizes of $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ exhibited the best superhydrophobicity，as shown in Figure 7a. When the mesh pore size was below $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ the apparent contact angle decreased due to the decreased airwater interface.However,when the mesh pore size was higher than $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ ,the mesh pore size was too large to store the air in the structure,so the surface tension could hold the water droplet. As the mesh pore size continued to increase，the superhydrophobic performance of the mesh decreased.Therefore, the ideal pore size for the mesh is $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ .Theobtained mesh with a $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ pore size was folded into a small box （204 $( 4 \\times 3 \\times 1 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } ,$ ),as shown in Figure 7b.The small box could freely float on the water because of its superhydrophobicity. The oil rapidly permeated into the box while water was completelyrejected. ",

The change of apparent contact angles was nearly negligible.The obtained mesh was exposed to the atmosphere for 6O days,and the mesh surface with superhydrophobicity was stable,as shown in Figure 7e. Further, the mesh was immersed in a 3.5 wt $\\%$ NaCl aqueous solution for 12 days.It was found that the apparent contact angle of the obtained mesh for the water droplet $( 5 \\mu \\mathrm { L } )$ was kept almost stable,as shown in Figure 7f.

They showed superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties.Under optimum conditions, the obtained mesh exhibited an apparent contact angle of $1 6 0 \\pm 1 . 0 ^ { \\circ }$ for the water droplet and $0 ^ { \\circ }$ for the oil droplet. The superhydrophobic samples were stable by ultrasonic oscillation,exposure tests in the atmosphere,and immersion corrosion tests in a 3.5 wt $\\% \\mathrm { { N a C l } }$ aqueous solution. On the basis of the obtained mesh,a miniature oil/water separation device was designed,which could be simply and effectively used for the separation of an oil/water mixture.The method in this studyis suitable for larger-scale fabricationand has potential applications in oil/water separation.
