Many of these compounds,which have a peptide origin,are synthesized either ribosomally or nonribosomally. Among the nonribosomally generated amphipathic cyclic lipopeptides,surfactins,iturins,and fengycins have well-recognized potential applications in biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products due to their antagonistic activities and surfactant properties (2,3).Furthermore,the mechanisms behind the observed biocontrol efficacyof different Bacillus strainshave also been well described (4-6).Lipopeptides are able to induce systemic resistance in plants and to facilitate the multicellular behaviors of the producing strains,such as swarming motility,biofilm formation, and colony morphology (5-7).

        "text": "Surfactins,iturins,and fengycins are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) which exhibita distinct modular architecture (2,8-10).A module is typically composed of three core domains,with each domain responsible for a certain biochemical reaction (11). Specifically, the amino acid adenylation domain(A domain) controls the entry of substrates into the peptide structure by recognizing and activating a specific amino acid.The thiolation domain(T domain),also referred to as the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP),contains an invariant serine residue which is essential for the binding of a $4 ^ { \\prime }$ -phosphopantetheine cofactor. The N-terminal condensation domain(C domain） is required for the coupling of two consecutively bound amino acids (12,13).These three domains constitute a minimal elongation module,the basic repetitiveunit ofa multimodularNRPS.Furthermore,modules can be supplemented with domains that catalyze modifications of the activated amino acid,such as N-methylation and epimerization.In some cases,when the first module of an NRPS complex lacks a C domain,the last module contains a termination thioesterase domain(TE domain）to release the end product (14).The order and specificity of the modules within the protein template determine the sequence of the product (for type A,linear NRPSs) (8,11).Genetic and biochemical analyses have revealed that the modular arrangement of most lipopeptide synthetases is colinear with the amino acid sequences of lipopeptides (1,2).This assembly line arrangement of the conserved catalytic modules and domains provides the means to construct hybrid NRPSs for use in the synthesis of new lipopeptide compounds (15-18). The prospect of creating numerous bioactive lipopeptides by engineering existing lipopeptide synthetases has stimulated the search for new NRPSs responsible for lipopeptide synthesis (19-24). ",

These include the type B and type C NRPSs,which iteratively use all of their modules and certain domains,respectively, during the assembly of a product (25-28).While our understanding of the nonlinear NRPS biosynthetic mechanism is limited,it is clear that this mechanism has great potential to introduce structural diversity to secondary metabolites through combinatorial biosynthesis (25,29,30).It is necessary to propose nonlinear NRPS biosynthetic models that can further unravel the details of this biosynthetic mechanism.The Gram-positive bacteriumB.subtilis serves as a model organism and is intensivelyused in the heterologous expression of commercial metabolites $( 3 0 -$ 32).However,apart from the present study,no nonlinear NRPS assembly line has been observed in this well-characterized species.

Locillomycins are active against bacteria and viruses,with low hemolytic activity,and can be used in natural health products for therapeutic applications.While the end products were straightforward,the proposed biosynthetic pathway of locillomycins contained several atypical aspects that were not predictable by bioinformatic analysis.Our study thus adds to the knowledge regarding nonlinearNRPSbiosynthesismechanismsused byB.subtilis and further broadens the potential of strain 9l6 as a model system for nonlinearNRPS studies.

The procedures for cultivation,isolation,and purification of locillomycins are described in detail in Materials andMethods.Briefly, the purification method consisted of organic solvent extraction, amino solid-phase chromatography, $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 8 }$ solid-phase chromatography,and repetitive HPLC purification (see Fig.S4 in the supplemental material). Detailed NMR and MS approaches were pursued simultaneously with the gene disruption analysis work to determine the chemical structures of the locillomycins.Locillomycin C was used as a representative example to explain the structural characterization of all locillomycins (Fig.3). The amino acid residue types and connectivity were obtained by analyzing the ROESY and TOCSY spectra (36).We concluded that there are nine residues in locillomycin C and that these residues are connected in the sequence Thrl-Gln2-Asp3-Gly4-Asn5-Asp6-Gly7- Tyr8-Val9.These observations were consistent with the data from the tandem MS analysis (see Table S5 and Fig. S8). Several ThrlVal9 interactions observed in the ROESY spectrum indicate that these two residues are close in space,implying the possibility of a cyclic structure connected end to end. The existence of a long alkyl group is evident from the large peaks around 1.2 to $1 . 4 \\mathrm { p p m }$ in the $^ { 1 } \\mathrm { H }$ spectrum and corresponding peaks in the $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ spectrum. Protonated carbons were assigned after the assignment of most protons, with the aid of the $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ -edited ( $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 }$ negative, $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 }$ and CH positive) HSQC spectrum.Allknown fragments of the compound accounted for 13 carbonyl signals,while there were l4 carbonyl signals in the $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ spectrum. This indicated that there must be a carbonyl group in the long alkyl chain of this compound.By analyzing both the HMBC and ROESY spectra, the attachment site between the carbonyl alkyl chain (actually a long-chain acyl group）and the peptide moiety was determined.Moreover, both spectra confirmed that the peptide chain was indeed cyclical in nature,through the end-to-end connection ofThrl and Val9 (Fig. 3). Finally, the number of $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 }$ groups was determined by integrating the multi- $\\cdot \\mathrm { C H } _ { 2 }$ area,and the result is in accordance with the results of mass spectrum analysis.No fragment from the alkyl group was identified by MS,and neither the DEPT nor proton spectrum indicated that there was branching in this alkyl group. Stereochemistry analysis of the amino acids was performed by HPLC after complete degradation of the compounds (see Fig. S9). Only one of the nine amino acids was found to be in the D-configuration (D-Gln). The resulting chemical structure is shown in Fig.4.As for locillomycins A and B,analysis of NMR and MS spectra showed that they were very similar to locillomycin C,and there was a difference in molecular mass of only $\\mathrm { 1 4 D a }$ between the different locillomycins $\\mathrm { { ' C } > B > A }$ ）(see Tables S3 to S5 and Fig. S6 to S8). This difference is derived from the different lengths of the long-chain acyl group shown in Fig. S10,and the method of structural determination is not detailed here. ",

        "text": "Proposed locillomycin biosynthesis pathway. The gene cluster for locillomycin biosynthesis identified in the present study sets the stage for further delineating the intricate chemical assembly of this family of lipopeptide antibiotics.Based on the chemical structures of locillomycins,the analysis of in vivo gene disruptions,internal adenylation domain experiments,the amino acid sequence homology of loc-encoded proteins to enzymes,and previous knowledge of lipopeptide biosynthetic pathways,we propose a model for the locillomycin biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 6). In brief, it is a pathway where a cyclic lipononapeptide is assembled by multifunctional enzymes ofa hexamodular NRPS.In the initial step,the ACS domain couples coenzyme A to a long-chain fatty acid,presumably a tridecanoic to pentadecanoic acid,in an ATPdependent reaction.The activated fatty acid is then transferred to the 4-phosphopantetheine cofactor of the T domain.In the second step,the fatty acid is coupled to the activated threonine directly,catalyzed by one of the condensation domains preceding the Al domain of the peptide synthetases,with the KAS domain, two T domains,and one C domain skipped (Fig. 6).In subsequent condensation reactions,the donor part,containing the fatty acid and thiolated threonine,is connected to the acceptor part, containing the A2 domain-activated glutamine,which is epimerized by the E domain following A2 before the next extension step (Fig. 6).The process continues in a canonical fashion until the A4 domain-activated glycine is connected.When this occurs,the whole LocB peptide is used a second time for further extension (Fig.6). This time A2 activates asparagine rather than glutamine, which is connected to the donor without epimerization.Extension then proceeds through LocB and LocC all the way down to the TE domain,which catalyzes the cyclization of the synthesized linear peptide by connecting the carbonyl group of Val9 and the hydroxyl group of the Thrl side chain before releasing the mature cyclic lipopeptide oflocillomycins (Fig.6) (39). One should notice in particular that the first A domain(A1) and the last two A domains (A5 and A6) are used only once,whereas the three A domains in the middle (A2,A3,and A4) are used iteratively during the biosynthesis (Fig.6).Moreover,the A2 domain in LocB somehow exhibits a different specificity in the iteration.Also,the epimerization domain following the A2 domain,which is responsible for conversion of L-Gln to D-Gln the first time,is skipped the second time(Fig.6).The different selectivities of these catalytic domains within the same NRPS assembly line are quite unusual compared to other NRPS assembly lines.Thus,compared to the iterative uses in type B and C NRPSs,the loc-encoded NRPS was designated a type D NRPS (Fig. 6) (25-28).
