The results also showed that in the case of considering the heat storage,the flow in the water wallis easier to return to stable state than without considering heat storage. ",

        "text": "Inrecent decades, the flow instabilityhas caused wide concern on the design and operation of various heat transfer equipments,such as nuclear reactors,refrigeration plants and boilers.It may result in oscillation of wall temperature,lead to fatigue damage of tube and heat transfer deterioration [1]. Thus making investigations on flow instability is very essential. Since 1938, the domestic and foreign scholars have carried out extensive and in-depth study on the two-phase flow instability [2-16]. However,there is few research on the problem of the flow instability considering the heat storage of the tube wall metal in a boiler. The heat flux density of the furnace is influenced by the heat storage of metal, then the dynamic characteristics of the furnace will also be influenced,so it isnecessaryto study thehydrodynamic flow instability of a boiler when the heat storage of the tube wall metal is considered.In this paper,the numerical computational model considering the heat storage of metal and suitable for the analysis of flow instability and the calculation of wall temperature is established by the lumped parameter method.Based on Fortran, the single channel model and the time-domain method are adopted. In order to provide guidance for the design and operation of boiler,we select the loop that is most likely to occur flow instability in the water wall as the research object. ",

The second one is time-domain method, based on numerical discretization and integration,which conserves the nonlinear information of the original equations [24-28]. The time domain method is employed in the present code.The temperature of the tube wall can be calculated by using lumped parameter method or distributed parameter method.In this paper,the lumped parameter method is used to analyze and calculate the wall temperature.
