        "text": "AbstractShanshenmiaozui site in Nihewan Basin in North China is a recently discovered Early Pleistocene site which yields rich and diverse mammalian fossils.In the fauna,the small and medium-sized bovid fossils are well represented and can be referred to the following taxa: Spirocerus wongi,Gazella sinensis,Ovis shantungensis and Megalovis piveteaui respectively, among which G. sinensis is the dominate species.S.wongi and G. sinensis are mainly represented by horn-cores and partial skull bones as well as mandibles; in addition,metacarpal and/or metatarsal bones were also recognized for all of the four species.The horn-cores are easy to be identified to the species level, while the dentitions and the postcranial bones underwent a series of examinations and comparisons before getting properly determined and referred to the most approximate taxa.Among the postcranial bones,the metapodials,especially to the metacarpal bones special attentions were paid,which are crucial not only for taxonomic identification,but also for phylogenetic and paleoecological reconstructions; the previously misidentified metapodial specimens in Nihewan fauna were reconsidered in this paper. In the SSMZ fauna,the bovid guild is dominated by Gazella and Bison,which indicates steppe was the most important biome in Nihewan Basin during Early Pleistocene. ",

Moreover, the recent publications prefer to use “homonymous” and “heteronymous\",if the left horn twists clockwise, the horns are termed homonymous,or else it's heteronymous. ",

Later on, the similar fossils from Nihewan (Teilhard de Chardin and Piveteau,193O) and Yushe (Teilhard de Chardin and Trassaert, 1938) also were referred to this genus. Spirocerus was originally included into the subfamily Tragelaphinae by Teilhard de Chardin and Trassaert (1938),later on, it was referred to the subfamily Caprine (Sokolov,1953); while currently it is usually placed in the subfamily Antilopinae (McKenna and Bell, 1997; http://taxonomicon.taxonomy. nl/TaxonTree.aspx?src $\\scriptstyle : = 1$ 0&id=68446). More recent assignment is to Bovinae (Bai et al., 2019). Up to now, the classifications of Spirocerus at the species level are mainly based on horncore characters,which caused quite a lot of confusions. Kahlke (1999) proposed that the most primitive Spirocerus with only anterior carena should be referred to S. wongi. Concerning the bicarinate forms with longer and slender horn-cores,the stratigraphically older ones can be referred to S. kiakhtensis peii, while the younger materials with correspondingly shorter and more massive horn-cores to S. kiakhtensis kiakhtensis. Moreover, all of the species of Spirocerus have heteronymous spiraled horns. ",

Moreover, the current knowledge is mainly about the horn-cores, whereas the cranial features of the genus Spirocerus is still unknown; the dental and postcranial characters are still insufficiently studied yet, because no dentition was found attached to a skull with horn-cores in the fossil record. Relative to its cranial size, Spirocerus should have big postcranial bones, but the partial skeleton associated with skull materials of S. kiakhtensis discovered near Ulan-Ude of Russia showed that the limb bones of this kind of animals are quite short but robust; therefore, it was inferred that Spirocerus has big skullbut short limbs and similar body-build as the extant muskox does (Sokolov, 1959).

Antilospira is the most similar contemporaneous taxon with Spirocerus, and it was also uncovered in the Nihewan Basin, but it can be distinguished from the latter by the following characters: un-straight horn-cores, usually with two grooved and slowly twisting carenas (Teilhard de Chardin and Trassaert, 1938).

Sokolov (1959) postulated that the extinct Spirocerus should have a similar appearance as muskox (Ovibos). It's a pity that the fossil records for this animal are too few to reach a definite phylogenetic approach currently.

The species G.sinensis is typical for its lower ${ \\mathfrak { p } } 4$ which is different from that of G.subgutturosa and earlier Gazella species in its exclusively closed anterior valley,and it is different from the Procapra species in its exclusively open posterior valley, no matter how narrow it is.

The present study shows that $O$ ，shantungensis has much longer metapodial bones than other caprine taxa do. $M .$ piveteaui is also poorly represented in the fossil record, but it has very typical lower p4 and robust metacarpal bone; both characters support a closer afinity of Megalovis to ovibovines.Among the postcranial bones, the metapodials, especially the metacarpal bones are crucial not only for taxonomic identification, but also for phylogenetic and paleoecological reconstructions.
