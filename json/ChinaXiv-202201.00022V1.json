        "text": "Abstract: This study aimed to elucidate the influence of inflow water on the salinity concentration process of a saline lake and the mass balance of Lake Issyk-Kul, a tectonic saltwater lake in Kyrgyzstan. Based on the survey results and meteorological data from 2012 to 2015,we analyzed the dissolved chemical composition loads due to water inflow. Then, we discussed the relationship between the increase in salinity and water inflow into the lake.Through the water quality analysis data,we used the tank model to estimate the river inflow and analyze the loads by the L-Q curve. The groundwater loads were then estimated from the average annual increase in salinity of the lake over a period of $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ .The results suggest that Lake Issyk-Kul was temporarily freshened between about AD 1500 and 180O when an outflowing river existed,and thereafter, it became a closed lake in AD 18OO and continued to remain a saline lake until present. The chemical components that cause salinization are supplied from the rivers and groundwater in the catchment area,and when they flow into the lake, $\\mathrm { C a ^ { 2 + } }$ ， $H C O _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } }$ precipitate as $\\mathrm { C a C O } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { M g C O _ { 3 } }$ . These compounds were confirmed to have been left on the lakeshore as evaporite. The model analysis showed that $1 . 6 7 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ of $\\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ and $\\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } }$ supplied from rivers and groundwater are precipitated as evaporite and in other forms per year. On the other hand,salinity continues to remain in the lake water at a rate of $2 7 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ per year. These are the main causes of increased salinity in Lake Issyk-Kul. Since $\\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ are considered to be derived from geothermal water, they will continue to flow in regardless of the effects of human activities.Therefore,as long as these components are accumulated in Lake Issyk-Kul as a closed lake,the salinity will continue to increase in the future.

Global climate warming is reported to be lowering the water levels of inland lakes around the world (Gross,2O17).In the Dead Sea, the water level has decreased by $1 \\ \\mathrm { m / a }$ between 1996 and 2001 (Lensky et al.,2005). In addition, Lake Urmia, Great Salt Lake, Walker Lake, Aral Sea Owes Lake, etc., have shown significant decreases in water volume over the past 140 a (Wurtsbaugh et al.,2017). The decrease in the water level of Great Salt Lake is said to be caused not only by global warming but also by increased use of water by human activities (Shope and Angeroth, 2015). To address this issue, researchers have widely conducted internationally on water mass balance (e.g.， Meng, 2019; Alifujiang,2021). On the other hand, changes in salinity due to lowering of the lake level have also attracted attention in recent years (Benduhn and Renard, 2004; Chen, 2019). Changes in the salinity of lakes have a significant impact on the ecological environment and are therefore an important environmental issue. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to quantitatively understand the unique water quality characteristics of lakes and their interrelationships with rivers and groundwater. ",

        "text": "It is known that water quality composition of saline lakes varies from lake to lake,for example, Crater Lake in Uganda has a $\\mathrm { \\Delta N a - H C O _ { 3 } }$ type composition and Stony Lake in Canada has a $\\mathrm { M g - S O _ { 4 } }$ type composition (Livingston, 1963). The water quality classification of salt lakes can be explained by the large and small relationships between $\\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ and ${ \\mathrm { H C O } } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ in the inflowing water (Mochizuki et al.,2018). For example, in the case of a $N a { \\mathrm { - } } C l { \\mathrm { - } } C 0 _ { 3 }$ type saline lake,if the concentration of ${ \\mathrm { H C O } } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ in the inflowing water is higher than that of $\\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ ,the amount of $\\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ will decrease because it will flocculate and precipitate as $\\mathrm { C a C O } _ { 3 }$ . On the other hand, the supply of ${ \\mathrm { H C O } } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ by the influent water will continue. As salinity enrichment progresses, the water quality of the lake becomes of the $N a { \\mathrm { - } } C l { \\mathrm { - } } C O _ { 3 }$ type as the water is enriched in $\\mathrm { { N a } ^ { + } }$ ， $\\mathrm { C l } ^ { - }$ and $\\mathrm { H C O } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ (Eugster and Hardie,1978). Therefore,to clarify the process of water quality formation in saline lakes, it is important to understand the quality of inflow water. ",

The load-flow curve (i.e.,L-Q curve) is an empirical formula for load (L） and flow(Q),and after deriving the L-Q curve, the loads can be calculated from the flow value. The L-Q curve is mainly used to estimate the impact of anthropogenic pollution (Yokota et al.,2013; Miyazako et al., 2014; Sugai et al.,2016; Le et al.,2020),and few examples of its use in elucidating the process of water quality formation in saline lakes are reported. However， quantitative understanding of the chemical constituents flowing into saline lakes will lead to future predictions on the increase and decrease of salinity and to an understanding of the mechanism of water quality formation in saline lakes.

It has experienced an increasing trend in salinity since the field observations made in 1986,and the salinity is still increasing (Kawabata et al.,2014; Saitoh and Kodera,2019). The lake level showed a downward trend since 1929, but again an increasing trend since 1999 (Fukushima, 2006; Romanovsky et al., 2013；Salamat et al.， 2Ol5). The relationship between water level and salinity fluctuations is iregular and the cause of the increase in salinity cannot be clarified from the water balance alone. The water quality of the lake in the early 2OoOs was of the $\\mathrm { { N a - S O _ { 4 } } }$ , Cl type,but now, it is of the Na-Cl, $\\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ type and the water quality is changing (Karmanchuk, 2Oo2; Kawabata et al., 2014). Saitoh (2O19) and Saitoh and Kodera (2O19) believe that these changes are closely related to the quality of the inflowing water, and they surveyed the catchment river and groundwater between 2012 and 2O15.These studies have revealed the current status of water environment in the region by analyzing the dissolved chemical components in the rivers and groundwater around Lake Issyk Kul.

An overview of the model in this study is shown in Figure 2, where the routine is based on water depth in each story of the tanks arranged in series. Tank water will seep into the lower tank over time,or flow out through the side holes set at a certain height. Only the roof tank additionally receives both rainfall and evaporation. The lateral runoff from tanks does not start until the water level in each tank reaches the height of the side hole,but infiltrates into the lower tanks for any positive depth. The side discharges from each tank are the surface discharge at the top, intermediate discharge at the middle and groundwater discharge at the bottom. In this study, the tanks were setup in four stages (Fig. 2). In addition to surface discharge, intermediate discharge and groundwater discharge, we considered deep groundwater discharge, including the water from hot springs. This deep groundwater was not included in the river discharge, but was assumed to flow directly into the lake. ",

These data were used because Lake Issyk-Kul is vast and the precipitation varies from region to region. Therefore,the watershed was also divided into three regions and the flow rate was estimated for each region. The three meteorological observatories are Ka-dzhi-Say, Cholpon-Ata and Karakol,located in the southern, northern and eastern parts of the lake, respectively. The western part of the lake was not considered because this region lacks observatories and only traces of the lake's outflow rivers and few inflow rivers are present.

        "text": "Based on the above results, it can be concluded that Lake Issyk-Kul was temporarily desalinated between AD 1500 and 180o when an outflowing river existed because of the rise in the water level. Thereafter, the outflowing river disappeared as the water level was lowered again, and the chemical components in the inflowing water were concentrated in the lake water. The fact that this lake has full circulation with the mixing of surface and deep water layers throughout the year (Vollmer et al., 2Oo2） suggests that the lake could have discharged enough salt in $3 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ When the lake returned to its blocked state,the inflow water determined the water quality of the lake.Among the components, $\\mathrm { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ $\\mathrm { H C O } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ and $ { \\mathrm { M g } } ^ { 2 + }$ were mainly discharged from the lake water as $\\mathrm { C a C O } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathbf { M g C O } _ { 3 }$ , and the remaining $\\mathrm { { N a } ^ { + } }$ ， $\\mathrm { C l } ^ { - }$ and $\\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - }$ increased. The reason for the high $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ content in lake water is that the solubility product of $\\mathrm { C a C O } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { { M g } C O _ { 3 } }$ is higher for $\\mathbf { M g C O } _ { 3 }$ ，and hence, $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ tends to remain in the lake water. Similar to $\\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + }$ ， $\\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ^ { 2 - }$ is also considered to remain in the lake water because its load is higher than its consumption. Further, $\\mathrm { { N a } ^ { + } }$ and $\\mathrm { C l } ^ { - }$ mostly remained in the lake water are the most strongly influenced by groundwater. The influence of groundwater arises from the water inflow from some hot springs (geothermal water) that have higher salinity than the lake (Saitoh,2019). Kawabata et al. (2O14), Saitoh (2019) and Saitoh and Kodera (2O19) did not report any simple increasing trend in the change of each chemical component per year,and they found that the salinity repeatedly increased and decreased. These changes occur because the salinity decreases mainly in the surface layer of the lake when water with a low chemical concentration, such as river water and rainfall, enters the lake, and in the long term, the salinity of the lake continues to increase owing to the aforementioned effects. Based on the actual measurement data, in general, the salinity of the lake is expected to increase by $2 7 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ yearly unless the lake water is discharged. ",

        "text": "In this study, we assume that Lake Issyk-Kul was a freshwater lake when it was an open lake in the past. However, the water quality of Lake Issyk-Kul is still unclear when it was an open lake. In the future, it is necessary to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of the lake by analyzing diatom taxonomy. In addition, it is necessary to continuously collect basic data such as lake water levels and river flow rates to develop a more accurate water balance model. In this study, we have not been able to analyze the chemical components of the inflow water throughout the year. The challenge will be to improve the accuracy of the inflow water loads by shortening the water sampling intervals and analyzing them in more detail. By clearing these issues, it will be possible to build a more accurate model of the balance of dissolved chemical components. In order to achieve sustainable environmental conservation of saline lakes,it is important to take into account the inflow water loads,which is also important for saline lakes around the world. ",
