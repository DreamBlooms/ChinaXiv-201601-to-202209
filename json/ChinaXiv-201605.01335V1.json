These organelles consist of a neutral lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and associated proteins (3,5).It has been known that LDs serve as the energy reservoir of cells,which may increase the adaptation by mobilization and degradation of lipids during nutrient deprivation,and also connect with other cellular processes,including lipid transport,membrane biogenesis,lipotoxicity relief, protein storage and degradation,pathogenicity,and autophagy (6-9). Because the biology of LDs is closely linked to some diseases,such as obesity,type 2 diabetes,and atherosclerosis,great progress has been made in elucidating the cellular trafficking,dynamics,and biogenesis of LDs in mammalian cells (2,7,10).However, there have been few studies on LDs in other species,especially naturally lipid-producing microorganisms (11-l3).Analysis of these microorganisms is motivated by the fact that microbial lipid production holds a great promise to convert waste materials,including lignocellulosic biomass,into fattyacid-derived fuel molecules and chemicals in a scenario of biorefinery and sustainable development (l4,15).

Other LD proteins include lipid metabolism enzymes,Rab GTPases,coatomer components,ARF-related proteins,and SNARE proteins (2O).The presence of functionally diversified proteins in LDs suggests that the biological function of LDs is much more than just an energy reservoir (10, 21).

Interestingly,most of them (20 proteins) were also found as LD proteins in other species.The presence of metabolic enzymes indicated that LD is not onlya passive reservoir but also an energetic organelle in which metabolic reactions occur. Other large groups included those involved in protein synthesis, folding, processing, degradation, and transportation.There were 32 proteins that were identified as the components of the ribosome or translational machinery and 10 protein-folding-related chaperones,which were also frequently found in the LDs of other species (21).For example, it has been demonstrated that HSP7O of rat adipocytes is localized to LDs upon heat stimulation (37).Rab GTPases,coatomer components, v-SNARE,and ADP ribosylation factor are vesicle-trafficking-related proteins,which play crucial roles in LD formation and size determination.The fact that these proteins were found in LDs in this study was consistent with previous observations (2,7,21).We also identified 34 mitochondrial proteins,which might be due to the contamination that resulted from structural or functional interaction between LDs and mitochondria (38).A small proportion ofLD proteins,such as two histones,were involved in genetic information storage and processing,which was consistent with the results of a study on Drosophila (39).Moreover,8 and 3 proteins were related to cellular signaling and cytoskeleton formation, respectively,and 2l proteins were poorly characterized in this LD proteome.

The abundance ofLdp1 was highest in the NL sample whilelowest in the YPD sample (Fig. 2D),suggesting that it might be involved in lipid overproduction and giant LD formation.RHTO_07686,a 123-kDa protein similar to Aspergillus nidulans psi factor-producing oxygenase PpoA,was also identified.PpoA is a bifunctional P450 protein that oxidizes linoleic acid to (8R)-8-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid followed by the isomerization to form (5S,8R)-5,8-dihydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (44). The corresponding oxylipin products are hormone-like signaling mediators regulating the balance between asexual and sexual life cycles (44, 45).Ithas been demonstrated thatPpoAis localized to theLDs in A.nidulans (45),but detailed roles ofPpoA inLD function and lipid accumulation remained unclear.We also found a highermolecular-massPpoAisoform(about $1 7 0 \\mathrm { k D a }$ )whoseabundance was higher in the YPD and NL samples than in the PL sample (Fig. 2D).RHTO_03117,one of the two adenylate kinases and the ortholog of S.cerevisiae cytosolic Adkl,was the major protein of band 36.It was remarkable to find RHTO_03117 in theLD proteome obtained from the PL sample.Under PL conditions,the cellular levels of free phosphate and ATP and the energy charge may be low,and adenylate kinase is responsible for converting two ADP molecules into one ATP and one AMP to maintain ATP homeostasis (46).RHTO_04363,another abundant protein identified in the PL sample,was a mitochondrial L-malate dehydroge nase.

The most significant change was an enhanced densitometry of bands 31 and 32 in the NL sample and of band 36 in the PL sample compared with those in the YPD sample (Fig.2D).However, this assay was inadequate to offer more quantitative information.The dynamic changes of the LD proteins might have resulted from the regulation of gene expression and organelle targeting. The information about expression changes of LD-related genes should be included in the global differential transcriptome and proteome data sets.In our previous work,we have sequenced the transcript $3 ^ { \\prime }$ -end tags and performed a quantitative comparison of the transcriptomes between a sample cultured in minimal medium (MM) containing $4 7 \\mathrm { m M N H _ { 4 } } ^ { + }$ and a sample in nitrogen-limited minimal medium (MM-N).The lipid contents of the MM and the MM-N samples were $2 2 . 8 \\%$ and $3 3 . 3 \\%$ ,respectively,and the expression levels of over 2,Ooo genes were significantly different in these two samples (24). Interestingly,in this study we found that more than one-half of the LD-associated genes were expressed within a 2-fold variation between the MM and MM-N samples and only 9 genes were not detected in the $3 ^ { \\prime }$ -tag digital gene expression profiling analysis (Fig. 4A). Of those with a ${ > } 2$ -fold change,35 and 50 genes were up- and downregulated,respectively,in the MM-N sample (Fig. 4A; see also Tables S3 and S4 in the supplemental material).We also compared the proteomes of cells from the YPD culture (\"Seed\"),the NL culture for $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ 0 $^ { \\prime \\prime } 2 4$ ${ { \\mathrm {  ~ h } } ^ { \\prime \\prime } }$ ),and the NL culture for $9 6 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ $( ^ { \\infty } 9 6 \\mathrm { h } ^ { \\prime \\prime } )$ (24,25).

By rigorous statistical testing, the proteins that significantly changed in the NL samples in comparison with those in the nutrient-rich sample were found (Fig. 4B).Protein abundances changed similarly in the NL sample over time,because the proportion of overlap between the $2 4 \\mathrm { h } .$ /Seed data setand the 96 $\\mathrm { h } { } / \\mathrm { \\Omega }$ /Seed data set was high (Fig.4C).The changed proteins in the $^ { \\mathfrak { a } } 2 4$ $\\ln ^ { \\mathfrak { N } }$ and $^ { \\mathfrak { c } } 9 6 \\mathrm { h } ^ { \\mathfrak { n } }$ samples were merged,and 38 and 39 proteins were up-and downregulated,respectively,under nitrogen-limited conditions (see Tables S3 and S4 in the supplemental material).

These genes encoded proteins important for LD maintenance,enlargement,and mobilization.It was found that 6 genes were transcriptionally upregulated,which was coincident with the“omic”analysis.The protein abundance of Ldpl increased more than 200-fold in the $^ { \\mathrm { \\tiny ~ \\mathfrak { \\omega } ~ } \\mathfrak { g } _ { 6 } \\mathfrak { h } ^ { \\mathfrak { \\tiny ~ \\mathfrak { \\wedge } } } }$ sample compared with that in the“Seed” sample (Fig. 4D). The RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the upregulation of LDP1 in the MM-N sample (data not shown),although the transcriptome analysis failed to detect the expression level of LDP1,most likely because of the absence of the CATG site to generate the transcript tag.The RT-qPCR results also clearly showed that the transcriptional level of LDP1 was upregulated under both NL and PL conditions.Moreover,the transcription level was higher in the NL sample than in the PL sample (Fig. 4D).Interestingly, protein levels of Acll (ATP:citrate lyase) and Accl (acetyl-CoA carboxylase),key enzymes for the formation of precursors for lipid biosynthesis (24),were upregulated under the NL condition.The RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the transcription ofACL1 and ACC1was elevated inboth the NL- $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ and the PL- $. 4 8 \\mathrm { h }$ samples and that the transcription levels in the PL sample were lower than that in the NL sample (Fig. 4D).

Since Ldpl has a putative perilipin domain (Pfam number PF03036)and it is a potential LD structural protein,we carried out experiments to verify its LDlocalization,to examine its cellular distribution,and more importantly,to determine whether it was a keyplayer for giantLD formation.First,we made a polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing Ldp1.To determine the cellular distribution ofLdpl,we fractionated cell lysates into LDs,total membrane,cytosol,and PNS during the LD purification process. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were immunoblotted with the anti-Ldpl antibody,and the results clearly showed that Ldpl was present only in the LD fraction,even with much lower protein loading than in other cellular fractions (Fig.5A). These data confirmed the LD localization of Ldpl and suggested Ldpl as an LDspecific protein in $R .$ toruloides.We then compared the protein abundance of Ldpl in the LD fractions prepared from cells cultured under different conditions and found that the protein levels in both the $\\mathrm { N L } { - } 2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ and PL-48 h samples were higher than that in the YPD-24h sample.Moreover, theNL-24h sample had a higher level of Ldpl than the PL-48 h sample (Fig.5B),which matched well with the densitometry change of the protein bands that migrated identically to band 31 between these samples (Fig. 2D). These results were also in agreement with results from semiquantitative proteome and RT-qPCR analysis (Fig. 4D).Together, these observations clearly demonstrated the dynamic nature of Ldpl during lipid production.

However, there have been no systematic studies on the LD proteome ofbasidiomycetes.Moreover, this yeast is well known for the overproduction of lipids and pigments(15,22,23,50) and has been used as a microbial factory for the production of advanced biofuels(15,51).Manipulating the dynamics of LDs is a potential approach to engineer this yeast for the production of lipids and related metabolites at higher titer, rate,and yield.For example,the ER proteins seipin and fat storage-inducing transmembrane proteins (FIT1 and FIT2) have been found to regulate LD formation and morphology (52),and impairing the expression of seipin can increase TAG synthesis and lead to giant LD formation (53,54).In addition,higher levels of FIT1 or FIT2 have resulted in more and larger LDs (55).The expression of the LD structure protein caleosin 1(AtClol） from Arabidopsis in S.cerevisiae increased lipid accumulation (56).Recently,many efforts have been undertaken to engineer S.cerevisiae orEscherichia coli for the production of lipid-derived metabolites and biofuels,but the efficiency remained fairlylow(14,57).Alternatively,it has been shown that more than $7 0 \\%$ of the TAGs in $R$ toruloides can be converted to fatty acid ethyl esters when incubating lipid-rich cells with $1 0 \\%$ ethanol in an aqueous environment (58).It is believed that the LD provides the hydrophobic microenvironment forLD-associated lipases,which traditionally catalyzed the transesterification in nonaqueous media (59).Although the roles of LDs are important in lipid biotechnology, key factors regulating the LD dynamics remain poorly characterized in oleaginous species.

This enzyme could also hydrolyze TAG to fatty acid and diacylglycerol,which could then be hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol byRHTO_02359 (the ortholog of mammalian hormonesensitive lipase).The monoacylglycerol was hydrolyzed to fatty acid and glycerol by lipases RHTO_03913 and probably RHTO_ 03511.However,RHTO_02359 was absent in the LD proteome, suggesting that it was not recruited yet at the lipid accumulation stage,because the translocation of the activated and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase onto LDs depends on phosphory lation of the perilipin (Ldpl might play similar roles in this yeast) by protein kinase A in response to the cellular energy status (19). Released fatty acids may be metabolized,such as the transformation of linoleic acid to oxylipin by PpoA(RHTO_07686).Alternatively,fatty acids maybe oxidized via the $\\beta$ -oxidation process. Thelocation of $\\beta$ -oxidizationis believed to be in the mitochondrion and peroxisome,which are both in close proximity to LDs. Indeed,mitochondrial and peroxisomal proteins (RHTO_01116, RHTO_03348,and RHTO_00397) were identified in the LD proteome. PpoA was upregulated in lipid-rich cells (Fig. 4D).
