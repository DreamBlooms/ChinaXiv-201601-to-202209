VDAC1 will lose its ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ transport capacity when the ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ binding sites are blocked by Ruthenium Red (RuR) (Gincel et al., 2001). MCU is another identified ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ uniporter protein,which is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondrion (IMM) (Baughman et al., 2011). Numbers of proteins have been shown to regulate the activity of MCU,such as essential mitochondrial calcium uptake1/2 (MiCU1/2)，MCU regulator (EMRE)，MCUb and MCU regulator 1 (MCUR1) (Ahuja and Muallem,2014;Alam etal., 2012;Mallilankaramanetal.,2012a;Mallilankaraman et al.，2012b;Raffaello et al.,2013; Sancak et al., 2013).When cells undergo severedamage，mitochondrial permeability transitionpore (PTP) will open and release pro-apoptotic factors,especially cytochrome c, from mitochondria to the cytoplasm (Kinnally et al.,2011).Overexpression of VDAC1 renders cells sensitive to oxidative stress inducers,such as thapsigargin (TG) and arsenic trioxide (As2O3) (Ben-Hail and Shoshan-Barmatz，2012；Shoshan-Barmatz et al.， 2010;Shoshan-Barmatz et al., 2009). Ectopically expressed VDAC1 increases the concentration of ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ in the inner-membrane space of mitochondrion, leading to mitochondrial ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ overload and cytochrome c release (Brustovetsky et al.，2002；Madesh and Hajnoczky, $2 0 0 1$ ； Naranmandura et al.，2012；Rapizzi et al.,2002). Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf1 and initiates activation of caspase-3 (Chu et al., 20o1).As a subunit of the PTP，VDAC1 is involved in cytochrome c release and apoptosis (Zheng et al.，2004)．Whether MCU，the inner membrane ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ uniporter， has the similar function as ",

Recently， Pan et al. generated ${ \\mathsf { M C U } } ^ { - I - }$ mice and found that ${ \\mathsf { M C U } } ^ { - I - }$ mice are grossly normal (Pan et al., 2013), buta significant reduction of mitochondrial matrix calcium.In this study,we found that MCU knockdown did not affect the cell growth in both HeLa and primary CGNs,but rendered the cells resistant to oxidative stress.Mitochondrial ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ overload is usually observed during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R),and it is considered to aggravate I/R injury.As MCU is amitochondrial $\\mathsf { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ uniporter，inhibition of MCU activity might be a therapy strategy for oxidative stress-induced diseases.For example,inhibition of MCU activity has been demonstrated to attenuate I/R injury in multiple organs including brain，heart and liver (Dong et al.，2014; Schwartz et al.,2013; Zhao et al.,2013).Inhibition of MCU activity also protects brain and heart from iron overload-induced dysfunction (Kumfu et al., 2012; Sripetchwandee et al., 2013a; Sripetchwandee et al., 2014; Sripetchwandee et al., 2013b). Accordingly，enhancement of MCU activity increases ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ level in mitochondria and promotes oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (De Stefani et al.，2011). Interestingly，recent studies showed that the role of MCU in apoptosis is dependent on cell type.Knockdown of MCU protect HeLa cells, not in MEF cells,against oxidative stress induced apoptosis (De Stefani etal., 2011; Hall et al., 2014; Pan et al.,2013).
