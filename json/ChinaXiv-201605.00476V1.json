Physical maps are constructed bydetermining the size or direct sequencing of restriction fragments (Luo etal.,2003;van Oeveren et al.,2011). Until very recently,sequencing of minimum tiling paths has been performed using automatized Sanger sequencing (Groenen et al.，2012; Howe et al.,2013),although next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms have been applied for large-scale clone sequencing (Choulet etal.,2014;Li et al.,2015; Zhang et al.,2012).

In the last 5 years,progress in Triticeae genomics has followed three main paths: (i) shallow-coverage whole-genome sequencing data from flow-sorted chromosomes and transcriptome assemblies from NGS-data were integrated with dense genetic maps and collinearity information to construct so-called GenomeZippers (International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium，2014; Martis et al.,2013;Mayer et al.,2011); (ii) gene space assemblies were made from deep-coverage sequencing data on the wholegenome or whole-chromosome level and ultra-dense sequencebased genetic maps (Chapman et al.,2015; International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium，2012； International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium,2014;Mascher et al.,2013a) (ii)in parallel to the first two efforts,collaborative large-scale physical mapping projects were initiated to construct BAC-based physical maps of the whole genome (barley) or individual chromosome arms(wheat)(Feuilletet al.,2012).The genomewide physical map of barley hasbeen completed (Ariyadasaetal.,2014),as has the physical map of several wheat chromosomes or chromosome arms (Breen et al.,2013;Lucas et al.,2013;Paux et al.，2008; Philippe etal.,2013;Poursarebanietal.,2014;Raats etal.,2013). Clone-by-clone sequencing of the entire minimum tiling path of wheat chromosome 3B has been performed using a hybrid approach combining data from the Roche 454 and Illumina NGS platforms (Choulet et al.,2014). Scaling BAC sequencing from a single 1-giga-base-pair chromosome to the 5 Gb barley genome or the remaining twenty wheat chromosomes—each several hundred mega-base pairs in size—will require the efficient utilization of the most advanced high-throughput sequencing technologies.

Consequently，pooling should be performed only after construction of barcoded libraries as opposed to sequencing pools of BACs without barcoding and then (i) assembling a larger genomic segment formed by overlapping BACs，or (ii) pooling nonoverlapping BACsand relying on the assemblyalgorithms to separate reads from unrelated regions.

We found twelve such examples,one of which is shown in Figure 6.The cumulative length of all unique barley BACs assembled in the present study is 95 Mb.Extrapolating from the twelve full-length cDNAs that we found to be represented better in the BAC assemblies,we can estimate that a minimum of five hundred gene models may be fragmented or incomplete in the WGS assembly.This is only a very rough estimate that does not take into account differences in gene density along the genome.Genotypic differences can be excluded as the explanation for‘missing' genes as both the BAC libraries and the WGS assembly were derived from cultivar Morex.To conclude，the construction of a BAC-based reference sequence can be expected to improve the sequence representation of the barley gene space.

        "text": "The aim of BAC sequencing can be stated easily,to represent the entire nucleotide sequence of the genomic insert by a single sequence contig.In the present study, this task was complicated by great abundance and high copy of transposable elements in the barley genome，which prevented assembling BACs into a single contig in most cases.Although the assemblies represented onaverage ${ > } 9 8 \\%$ of the inserts,they remain fragmented into multiple contigs with an L50 of $9 5 ~ { \\mathsf { k b } }$ .This is not unexpected. The most important precedent for assembling a large and repeatrich genome is the human genome project. When the first working draft of the human genome was published, $\\sim 3 0 \\ 0 0 0$ large-insert clones were sequenced with Sanger sequencing technology and were represented by 40o ooo contigs with an L50 of $8 3 ~ \\mathsf { k b }$ (Kentand Haussler,2o01).The finalassembly of the BACs into single contigs required labour-intensive manual curation (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004).We anticipate that further improvements to the contiguity and genome representation of BACs comprising the minimum tiling path of the barley genome will proceed along the following lines: (i) generation and use of additional genomewide data sets to improve the contiguity of clone assemblies; (ii) use of long-read sequencingplatforms to close remaining gaps (English et al., 2012).Additional genomewide data sets may include deeply sequenced mate-pair libraries of various insert size，chromatin conformation capture sequencing (HiC) data (Burton et al.,2013; Kaplan and Dekker，2013）or in vitro-derived long-range connectivity information (Adeyetal.，2014).The data setsrequired for these steps cannot be collected at the level of single clones or larger BAC pools because the costs associated with doing so Would be prohibitively high,or because working with BACs,as in the case of chromatin conformation capture sequencing strate gies，may be meaningless.To utilize these genome-scale NGSbased techniques for scaffolding and gap-closing,a genomewide, nonredundant sequence assembly isnecessary.Therefore，a pipeline to automatically detect and visualize overlaps between clones was set up (Colmsee et al.,2015).This sequence overlap information will be used to construct nonredundant sequences on the level of finger-printed contigs，where adjacent clones overlap byapproximately $3 0 ~ \\mathsf { k b }$ . It is important to note that $90 \\%$ of the assembled sequence of our BACs is contained in contigs $\\geq 1 0 \\ k \\ b ,$ which allows to retrieve long $( > 1 0 ~ \\mathsf { k b } )$ ，high-identity $( > 9 9 . 5 \\% )$ overlaps between adjacent BACs.These overlaps can be well distinguished from regions of high sequence identity shared between copies of transposable elements on unrelated BACs.Thus, the immediate next goal of the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium is to finish the sequencing of all 66 772 clones of the minimum tiling path of the barley genome (Ariyadasa et al.,2o14) and to construct an initial nonredundant clone-based sequence assembly of the entire barley genome.

Thus,PacBio sequencing can be expected to yield finished single-contig assemblies of BACs using only automated procedures.PacBio continuously improves the performance ofits sequencing devices and has also introduced protocols for multiplex sequencing.Based on currently published results, however,it is not clear to us whether the cost and throughput of the PacBio sequencing platform willbe sufficient for sequencing a large number of BAC clones.Moreover，sequencing entire minimum tiling paths may require the development of new protocols for deep multiplexing protocols for the PacBio platform. Given the progress in the development of algorithms that can efficiently employ long,albeit error-prone reads for the assembly of eukaryotic genomes (Kim et al.，2014; Koren and Phillipy, 2015)，it can be envisaged that a whole-genome shotgun approach combined with single-molecule sequencing can be used to assemble huge plant genomes in the future.

Obviously，the construction of BAC libraries，physical mapping and clone sequencing are not limited to plant genomics. However,map-based genome sequencing is of particular interest to plant research,because of the complex structure of many plant genomes (large genomes ${ > } 5$ Gband abound in repetitive elements)，which is not amenable for whole-genome shotgun approaches.For instance,WGS assemblies of barley(5 Gb),white spruce $( 2 0 ~ \\mathsf { G b } )$ and hexaploid bread wheat (17 Gb) achieved only $4 0 \\mathrm { - } 7 0 \\%$ genome representation.The missing sequence presumably originates predominantly from families of repetitive elements whose individual copies are highly similar to each other and are thus prone to collapse into a single contig in the assembly. Obtaining assemblies that correctly represent repetitive regions is an important goal of reference genome projects in repeat-rich plant genomes.Transposable elements act as driving forces of genome evolution (Fedoroff,2012),and furthermore，they are involved in (i) the diversification of centromeres (Gao et al., 2015),(i) the rapid adaptation to changing environments (Stapley et al.,2o15) and (ii) the expression of genes near their insertion sites (Makarevitch et al.,2015).In addition the benefits of a mapbased reference sequence are not limited to a better resolution of repeat regions,but also improve the representation of genic regions. In the present study,we have shown that in contrast to the barley WGS assembly the sequence of full-length cDNAs is faithfully represented in BAC assemblies.The apparent absence of bona fide genes from the WGS assembly of barley reinforces the conclusion of Denton et al. (2014) that inferences on the number of genes and the sizes of gene families from draft genome assemblies should be treated with caution. ",
