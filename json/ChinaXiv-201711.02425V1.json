Type 2 diabetes (T2D, formerly called non-insulindependent or adult-onset) results from the body's ineffective use of insulin and comprises $90 \\%$ of people who have diabetes. The growing number of deaths atributable to diabetes reflects the insufficient glycemic control achieved by the past and current treatments 1. Thus new therapeutic agents are needed to develop to effectively combat diabetes. Glucagons-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) ² is an incretin secreted from the L cells of the small intestine in a glucose-dependent manner. This hormone can exert several biological functions including stimulation of insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagons secretion, induction of satiety, retardation of gastric emptying and stimulating the regeneration and differentiation of islet $\\beta$ cell ³.However, with such atracting anti-diabetic functions, GLP-1 is quickly degraded through dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) by being cleaved a dipeptide from the N-terminus and with a half live of 0.5 min under normal physiological condition 4.

        "text": "To combat a chronic disease,a drug is always preferred to have similar beneficial efects but with less toxicity at low doses.Even though there are several drugs on the market, highly potent and selective DPP-IV inhibitorsare still in great need.Therefore many novel DPP-IV inhibitors have ben synthesized based on the structures of 1,2 and 3 in recent years 11, which in turn leaves a large amount of chemical space to explore as few analogues of Alogliptin have been disclosed. In a previous report froourboaoeeos DPP-IV inhibitors which were intrinsically potent against DPP-IV and selective over the other dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) family of enzymes (see compound 6 in Figure 1 as an example). However, in the followed pharmacological evaluations, compound 6 was found to just have a $23 . 3 \\%$ bioavailability in rat12. Since DPP-IV inhibitors are oral anti-diabetic therapeutic agents, this fact raised our concerns about putative low in vivo efcacy. In fact, we suspected the insuficient oral bioavailability might be the reason that highly potent compound 6 ( $\\mathrm { T C } 5 0 { = } 0 . 3 3 ~ \\mathrm { n M }$ ）12 just exerted similar in vivo efficacy as Alogliptin. In our continued medicinal chemistry effort to develop anti-diabetic candidates， we conducted a pharmacokinetic (PK） property-driven optimization on this scaffold and led to a new scaffold of pyrrolopyrimidine analogues. By replacing the thienopyrimidine scaffold with its isostere pyrrolopyrimidine,we successfully solved the severe metabolic biotransformation problem existed in thienopyrimidine analogues.We further employed several different substituents on the new scaffold to increase their permeability and to reduce the transporter-mediated effux in order to avoid from low oral bioavailability caused by poor absorption. This PK-driven optimization had led to a new series of highly potent and selective DPP-IV inhibitors as represented by compound 1j which has a good balance of activity,selectivity,PK,and in vivo efficacy. Herein, we wish to report the synthesis and the process of this PK-driven optimization on these new pyrrolopyrimidine analogues: their pharmacological activities, PK,and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations.

However, compound 1a had an even worse oral bioavailability $( 5 . 7 \\% )$ in rat than compound 6. We reckoned on the sharp decrease in bioavailability and realized that although pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold could get rid of hepatic first pass effect. In the same time, it might induce other effect to damage its PK process. The cascade of events determining oral bioavailability is well known today. Substantial evidence reveals that human intestine plays as a big barrier for many oral drugs by means of biotransformation and active secretion by transporters like P-glycoprotein (P-gp)14. Thus,the incomplete oral bioavailability of compound 1a might be the result of poor absorption rather than severe first pass effect. We employed the monolayer of Caco-2 cels as the in vitro model for its being derived from human intestine to evaluate the absorption of compound 1a (Table 2). Not surprisingly, compound 1a had a very low permeability from the apical side (A) to the basolateral side (B) and a high transporter mediated efflux from B to A,resulting to an extremely high efflux ratio.

So far there are no direct structure-function relationships or pharmacophore models to describe the structural features responsible for transporter substrates. And the processleading to drug absorption and oral bioavailability is very complex 15. In our continued way to develop oral bioavailable DPP-IV inhibitors, we adopted several simple strategies based on rules introduced by literatures in hope to improve the absorption and reduce transportermediated efflux，which led to a series of pyrrolopyrimidine analogues 16. Initially we designed compounds 1b and 1c by employing alkyl and electro-withdrawing substituents with the hope to create some steric hindrance to reduce the interaction with the transporters. At the same time, incorporation of alkyl groups could increase the lipophilicity to improve the permeability. Data were summarized in Table 2. Compounds 1b and 1c showed an improved A-B permeability and significantly lower efflux ratios. At the meantime, diferent substituents displayed varied B-A efflux ability. Electro-withdrawing groups increased the B-A transport (compound 1a V.s.1c and 1e). In our further effort to block potential P-gp binding with secondary amine function， we added methyl to 1-position to remove the possible hydrogen bond donor,which led to compounds 1d and 1e. Decreased donor would also reduce the desolvation energy cost to increase penetration. Still,1-position substitution improved the permeability and decreased the eflux ratio in diffrent degrees. Based on the preliminary data and compound 1c, which had a lowest efflux ratio of 2.05, we continued to employ some other ${ \\tt R } _ { 2 }$ groups (compounds 1f1h) and evaluated their absorption, among which compound 1h had an acceptable ratio.
