Which are the benchmark interest rates that have broad influences on most interest rates is a major concern for economists.In this paper,multi-variable Granger causality test is developed and applied to construct a directed network of interest rates,whose important nodes,regarded as key interest rates,are evaluated with inverse Page Rank scores.The results indicate that some shortterm interest rates have larger influences on the most key interest rates，while repo rates are the benchmark of short-term rates.It is also found that central bank bills rates are in the core position of mid-term interest rates network,and treasury bond rates are leading the long-term bonds rates. The evolution of benchmark interest rates is also studied from 2008 to 2014,and it's found that SHIBOR has generally become the benchmark interest rate in China. In the frequency domain we detect the properties of information flows between interest rates and the result confirms the existence of market segmentation in China bond market. ",

Among the literature using physical method to study economics， complex network provides us a visual and useful tool to learn the properties of complex systems. Complex network analysis，which can display the relations of nodes in real world in the form of network,is firstly developed to study the topology structure of some real networks like internet,movie actor collaboration network,citation networks,and so on [2]. In financial market,complex network has been successfully applied in the analysis of investigating the financial contagion in the banking system and the inner structures of global stock markets based on the links and directions between the nodes [3- 9].Complex systems are classified into different clusters according to the links between the agents,also dynamic evolutions of the system can be described with the network diagrams in different time windows. Some other scholars studied the correlations between different equities within a nation's stock market,which are helpful for investors to construct the portfolio and diversify the investment risks [4-6,10].What's more,besides analysis of the hidden relations between the agents,network of corporations’ ownership can be constructed if company A is the shareholder of company B,then the extracted networks with out-degrees or in-degree analysis will tell us who are the important shareholders for the sample corporations [11].

According to preliminary statistics (based on data from www.webofscience.com)，there are around 340o papers on financial physics,in which nearly one fifth focus on stock market.But bond market,as an important part of financial markets likewise,whose inner relations among bond rates (also known as interest rates) receive scant attention in most econo-physics literatures.Interest rates play an important role in the investment decision-making process and asset allocation [12]，and many papers by economists have suggested that there exist tight links between interest rates and economic indicators (output growth,inflation，consumption，investment，labor,and stock price， etc.）[13-19] However， few economists or physicists paid attention to the relations between interest rates in the bond market.Various interest rates are fluctuating in their own speeds,whether there are benchmark interest rates which have broad influences on the other interest rates? And which rates are the benchmark interest rates? In this paper,we make an attempt to detect the benchmark interest rates in China bond market with the complex network method and to study the topological structure of the constructed network.The determination of benchmark rate will be helpful for conducting the transmission of monetary policy,and also the financial product valuation,as well as the process of interest rate marketization 20,21].

Ref. [28]studied the interest rates in euro zone, and found a more complex structure between interest rates.The benchmark interest rate is not simply the lowest rate in a specific period but the rate which is the pricing benchmark for most other rates.Until now, there is no benchmark interest rate accepted universally in China.In earlier periods,the interbank offered rates or the repo rates are tested to be the benchmark of Chinese bond market[21,29,30]，while Shanghai Interbank Rates(SHIBOR）is deemed to be a better benchmark index in recent studies [31,32].

There are a lot of correlations between various interest rates, which can be used to construct the structure network of interest rates. Granger causality test which has been widely applied in the field of economics,is to detect the causal relationship between two time series initially [33-35],and then been extended to multivariable time series analysis [1O,36-38]. The initial bivariate Granger causality test may have some inherent limitations. For example,if rate A has an influence on rate B,while B affects another rate C, but A does not have any influence on C.When we test the causal relationship between A and C using pairwise Granger causality test， the wrong patterns of connectivity will be reported. To avoid this,unlike earlier studies only focused on two time series,this paper uses the multivariable Granger causality test to form a directed network structure which shows the causal links and inter-relationships between nearly all the interest rates in China. Based on the topology structure of complex network，we can find a key rate in the core position，which is regarded as the benchmark interest rate.Information flows in the network are also studied in the frequency domain. And we find some proofs of the existence of market segmentation in Chinese bond market. ",
