        "text": "Folate (vitamin B9) deficiency causes several health problems globally. However,folate biofortification of major staple crops is one alternative that can be used to improve vitamin intakes in populations at risk.We increased the folate levels in common bean by engineering the pteridine branch required for their biosynthesis.GTP cyclohydrolase Ifrom Arabidopsis (AtGchl) was stably introduced into three common bean Pinto cultivars by particle bombardment.Seedspecific overexpression of AtGCHl caused significant increases of up to 150-fold in biosynthetic pteridines in the transformed lines.The pteridine boost enhanced folate levels in raw desiccated seedsbyup to threefold $3 2 5 ~ \\mu \\ g$ ina $1 0 0 \\ { \\mathfrak { g } }$ portion),which would represent $8 1 \\%$ of the adult recommended daily alowance. Unexpectedly,the engineering also triggered a general increase in PABA levels,the other folate precursor.This was not observed in previous engineering studies and was probably caused bya feedforward mechanism that remains to be elucidated.Results from this work also show that common bean grains accumulate considerable amounts of oxidized pteridines that might represent products offolate degradation in desiccating seeds.Our study uncovers a probable different regulation of folate homoeostasis in these legume grains than that observed in other engineering works.Legumes are good sources of folates,and this work shows that they can be engineered to accumulate even greater amounts of folate that, when consumed,can improve folate status. Biofortification of common bean with folates and other micronutrients represents a promising strategy to improve the nutritional status of populations around the world. ",

        "text": "Common bean (PhaseolusvulgarisL.）isa grain legume that contains high amounts of energy and is a good source of minerals and vitamins.Bean grains are also rich in protein and represent the major source for some populations. Common bean is also the third most important source of calories in Latin America (Broughton et al.，2oo3).The annual worldwide production of this legume in 2013 was more than 23 million metric tonnes. Brazil is the largest bean producer in the Americas,followed by Mexico and the United States of America，while the major producers worldwide are found in Asia (Myanmar and India, respectively) (FAO，2013)． Humans require a minimum daily intake of essential micronutrients to fulfil the biochemical processes needed for life,and micronutrient deficiency is a major global problem;around $4 0 \\% - 5 0 \\%$ of the world's population will at some point in their lives suffer from a disorder caused by a mineral and/or vitamin deficiency (Graham et al.,2oo1).Folates (vitamin B9) are essential components in the human diet; theyare involved in several anabolic pathways that require one-carbon (1C)transfer reactions such as nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis， the methylation cycle and NADPH production (Bekaert et al.,2008; Fan et al.,2014).Humans cannot synthesize folates as plants and bacteria can; thus,we need to obtain them from the diet and plants are our main source.Folate is a generic term that encompasses tetrahydrofolate (THF)and its derivatives (Figure 1a).A THF molecule is composed of a pteridine ring that is synthesized in cytosol，p-aminobenzoate (PABA)is produced in plastids,and both are condensed and glutamylated in mitochondria (Figure 1). In addition，natural folates havea $\\gamma$ -linked polyglutamyl tail that isadded by the folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). ",

However, these strategies rely on food processing and distribution chains that arenot alwaysavailable to all populations.A promising alternative is folate biofortificationin plant foods. Biofortification enhances a food's nutritional quality through breedingor engineering;it has the potential to be sustainable and，if conducted in major staple crops，reach targeted populations (Mayer et al.,2008).

These reactions are mediated by GTP cyclohydrolase I(GCHl) and aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS),respectively (Figure 1b). Recently, the expression of FPGS and folate-binding protein along with GCHl and ADCS has further increased folates in rice endosperm (Blancquaert et al.，2015).Biofortification of plant foods with folates can be feasible,and common bean is both a good source and vehicle for nutrient delivery in Latin America and elsewhere.This work reports the first engineering of folates in a legume plant.

In this work,we overexpressed the pteridine branch of the folate biosynthesis pathway as it had been done in other plants (Diaz de la Garza et al.,2oo4;Hossain et al.,2004; Naqvi et al.,2009;Nunes et al.,2009; Storozhenko et al.,2007). In accordance with previous studies,this strategy led to modest increases in folate levels. Common bean already contains significant amounts of folate;however,the 3.3- and 2.4-fold increases in the Saltillo and Café lines resulted in valuesas highas 268 and $3 2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { g } }$ of folate in a $1 0 0 \\ { \\mathfrak { g } }$ portion,which represents $67 \\%$ and $82 \\%$ ，respectively， oftherecommendeddaily allowance (RDA) for an adult.It is noteworthy that with exception of rice,in which folate levels were not changed,augmenting only the pteridine content in fruit,leaves，tubers and endosperm yielded very similar increases in each case (between twofold and fourfold).This occurred regardless of the initial folate levels of the Wt species,which in each case varied fromvery low in cereals $( 0 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { n m o l / g ) }$ to high in leaves and bean seeds (close to $3 \\ \\mathsf { n m o l / g } )$ Additionally in the aforementioned studies,the polyglutamylation degree of $5 \\mathrm { - } C H _ { 3 }$ -THF did not change after folates were only doubled，contrary to what was observed when folates were boosted to higher levels and monoglutamylated forms were predominant (Diaz de la Garza et al.，2oo7;Storozhenko et al., 2007).In the present engineering work,the distribution of the polyglutamylated forms of $5 \\mathrm { - } \\mathsf { C } \\mathsf { H } _ { 3 }$ -THF in some AtGCHI lines slightly differed from the Wt in their proportion of $5 \\mathrm { - } C H _ { 3 }$ -THF decaglutamate(Supplementary Figure S2).

Even when this is a possibility,we consider it unlikely, based on the following considerations.Plant cells could protect pteridines from photo-oxidation with light harvesting，antioxidant,or reducing compounds or even through the enzymes that utilize them for folate biosynthesis.If the observed oxidized pteridines were the product of pteridine photo-oxidation,then the highest pteridine overproducers would have greater proportions of oxidized pteridines.However, this was not the case.S9 and C18,the highest pteridine producers,had just $10 \\%$ and $30 \\%$ breakdown pteridines，which contrasts to the Wt proportions $6 5 \\%$ onaverage).Tomato fruit that hyperaccumulated pteridines and presented modest folate increases showed a similar behaviour:HMPt was prevalent and no PtAl or Pt were detected (Diaz de la Garza et al.,2004).

In fact,this enzyme has been previously characterized and itsactivity in seeds was found to be significantly lower than in leaves (Noiriel et al., 2007).Thus,it is tempting to speculate that the rate of folate turnover in desiccating bean seeds might be high and assume that the folate salvage system isnot coping with the increased flux due to the engineering.Therefore，regulation of folate homoeostasis during seed desiccation and postharvest handling becomes critical for engineering folates in legume seeds.The results from the folate engineering in rice endosperm support this assumption，as engineered rice grains had high rates of folate losses during seed storage (Blancquaert et al.,2015).

However, when PABA was fed to seeds that hyperaccumulated pteridines, we could further increase folates (Figure 6).The simultaneous enhancement of PABA and pteridines during seed development will show the limits of the two-gene strategy for bean seeds;in addition,it seems that a pull strategy might also result in more folate accumulation.This approach was recently successfully used to stabilize boosted folates by overexpressing the cytosolic FPGS plusa folate-binding protein for folate‘sequestration'inrice endosperm (Blancquaert et al.,2015).

On the other hand,pteridine build-up has been a concern for human consumption,as HMPt is not part of the human pteridine metabolism.However,the pteridines characterized in Wt beans show thatwe have been exposed to relatively high pteridine levels through common bean consumption,especially in Latin American countries,in which this legume is a staple crop.

Common bean is the most consumed legume in the world; it is cultivated as a subsistence crop by rural populations in which folate fortification efforts are difficult to implement.Moreover, it is a good source of several vitamins and it is already the subject of important biofortification effortswith ironand zinc (Mayer et al., 2008),making it an excellent crop for delivering nutrients.In this work，we confirmed that common bean plants can be stably transformed and that we can use engineering strategies to increase folate levels in the edible seeds. However，further engineering isneeded to achieve folate levels thatare capable of providing an adult's entire RDA in a single serving of cooked common beans.This would help to lower the current number of 300 OoO annual cases of NTD (Berry et al.,2o1O) and impact the other thousands of cases of people with health problems related to folate deficiency worldwide.
