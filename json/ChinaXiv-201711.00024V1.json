The experiment of static characteristic is carried out in a standard wind tunnel and the aerodynamic noise of both fans is tested in a semi-anechoic room.Then,performances of the optimal unequally spaced fan are compared with those of the prototype fan.The results show that there is reasonable agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data. It is foundthat the discrete noise of the optimalunequally spaced fan is lower than that of the prototype fanat the near field monitoring point.This can be explained that the total pressure fluctuation of the optimal unequally spaced fan is much more regular than that of the prototype fan.

Besides, Sun believed that the blade space variation of fans in a large range wouldn't have the obvious effect on the aerodynamic performance of axial flow fan. Cui [5] applied this method on the fan for mines,and compared the actual effect ofblade number on noise reduction in the tunnel.The result showed that the noisereduction ofunequally spaced fan with singular blades was much larger than that of unequally spaced fan with even blades.The studies by Xu [6] showed that unequally spaced fan not only eliminated the well-regulated pressure destabilization caused by the equally spaced blades,but also weakened the resonance noise generated by the interference between the blades and the fixed obstacles in the ventilating duct, thus reducing the discrete noise of fans.
