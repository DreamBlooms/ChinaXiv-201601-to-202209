This paper presents the development and implementation of a decision support system (DSS) thatlinks the outputs of hydrological models with real-time decision making on social-economic assessments and land use management. Discharge and glacier geometry changes were simulated with hydrological model, water availability in semiarid environments. Irigation and ecological water were simulated by a new commercial software MIKE HYDRO. Groundwater was simulated by MODFLOW. All the outputs of theses hydrological models were taken as inputs into the DSS in three types of links: regression equations, stationary data inputs, or dynamic data inputs as the models running paralel in the simulation periods. The DSS integrates the hydrological data, geographic data, social and economic statistical data,and establishes the relationships with equations, conditional statements and fuzzy logics. The programming is realized in $C { + } { + }$ . The DSS has four remarkable features: (1) editable land use maps to asist decision-making; (2) conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources; (3) interactions among water, earth, ecosystem,and humans; and (4) links with hydrological models.The overallgoal of the DSS is to combine the outputs of scientific models, knowledge of experts, and perspectives of stakeholders, into a computer-based system, which alows sustainability impact assessment within regional planning; and to understand ecosystem services and integrate them into land and water management.

As the complexity and scope of IWRM increases, the difficulties of hydrological modeling are shifting from the model itself to the links with other cognate sciences and to understand the interactions among water, earth, ecosystem and humans. This paper presents the development and implementation of a decision support system (DSS) that links the outputs of hydrological models with real-time decision making on social-economic assessments and land use management. The DSS assists the decision-making in a qualitative manner based on the outputs of hydrological models and knowledge of experts in cross-disciplinary fields. ",

Few model is capable of integrating meteorological, geographical, ecological, social and economic factors, which is based on the simulation of hydrological models. Little research has been done to show the interactions of so many crossdisciplinary researches on IWRM to understand ecosystem services (ESS) and integrate them into land and water management. Due to model complexity issues, many DSS models have to consider less issues within a specific research framework (McCown, 2OO2; Basso and Ritchie, 2015). However, the model complexity of DSS is worth the effort (Chenoweth et al., 2O04; Power et al., 2015) to increase model accuracy on the comprehensive analysis in IWRM. ",

The overall goal of the DSS is to integrate all crucial research results of SuMaRiO, including stakeholder perspectives, into a model based decision support system, which allows a sustainability impact assessment within regional planning on land and water management in the Tarim River Basin to understand ESS and interactions with water, earth and humans. The DSS is an indicator based tool that enables stakeholders and decision-makers to evaluate the consequences of their intended actions, which helps to implement sustainable land and water management measures in the upcoming development plans (Disse, 2016).
