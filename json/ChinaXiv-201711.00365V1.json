Results show that the glacier flow velocity decreased from $5 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { a }$ in $1 9 8 0 / 1 9 8 1$ to $3 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m / a }$ in 2010/2O11. The annual variation in the direction of glacier flow velocity in the western branch and eastern branch was less than $1 ^ { \\circ } - 3 ^ { \\circ }$ ，and the change of glacier flow velocity in the western branch was more dramatic than that in the eastern branch. Glacier flow velocity was influenced by glacier morphology (including glacier area, glacier length,and ice thickness),glacier mass balance and local climate conditions (air temperature and precipitation),the glacier morphology being the leading factor. The long-term flow velocity data set of Urumqi Glacier No.1 contributes to a better understanding of glacier dynamics within the context of climatic warming. ",

Global warming has driven a significant global reduction in the mass balance of most glaciers during the second half of the $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century, resulting in a general retreating trend. This retreat was intensified at the end of the last century (Dyurgerov and Meier, 2Ooo; Khromova et al.,2003; Paul et al., 2004; Barry,2006;Li et al.， 2010;Wang et al.,2013). Glacier flow velocity refers to the rate of downhill motion under the influence of gravity,and this motion process includes sliding on the glacier bedrock and the internal deformation of the glacier (Singh and Singh,2Ool).Flow velocity is a basic parameter of glacier and is one of the main characters that differentiate glaciers from other natural ice bodies (Huang and Sun,1982；Kaab,2005). Glacier flow velocity varies at spatial and temporal scales. Monitoring of glacier flow velocity is a key to understanding the dynamics of glaciers (Zhou et al., 2OO9; Cufey and Paterson, 2010). ",

The measurements in diferent years were performed via various survey methods. Specifically, measurements of glacier flow velocity in 1959,1973 and 1980-2001 were accomplished via repeated theodolite measurements from observation stations on the bedrock ridge near the northern edge of the glacier terminus. During 2OO2-2Oo6, glacier flow velocity was measured using the total station.

Our survey was undertaken using a Unistrong E65O GPS.Receivers were placed at a fixed base position that was the same as the previous year, and roving receivers were used to concurrently survey the stakes.The repeat measurements can be used to construct a flow velocity field.

The direct and indirect path coefficients between glacier flow velocity and those independent variables (glacier morphological factors,glacier mass balance,and climate factors)are shown in Table 2.The direct path coeffcients of glacier area, glacier length,glacier mass balance,ice thickness,air temperature,and precipitation with glacier flow velocity were 59.97,-1.44,3.13,-59.89, 0.59,and 0.54,respectively. The path coeficient of residual terms was 0.02,indicating that the main factors influencing glacier flow velocity have already been considered in this study. To sum up,the direct path coefficient of glacier morphological factors (glacier area,glacier length，and ice thickness） with glacier flow velocity was the highest, followed by glacier massbalance and climate factors (air temperature and precipitation) (Table 2), indicating that glacier morphology exerted the greater influence on glacier flow velocity than climatic conditions,being similar to the results from the Qiyi Glacier $( 3 9 ^ { \\circ } 1 4 ^ { \\prime } 1 3 ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\mathrm { N }$ ， $9 7 ^ { \\circ } 4 5 ^ { \\prime } 2 0 ^ { \\prime \\prime } \\mathrm { E } )$ in the central Qilian Mountains, northern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Jing et al., 2011). It was previously reported that glacier length and area play an important role in glacier flow velocity (Jing et al.,2O11). For Urumqi Glacier No.1,glacier flow velocity decreased with the reductions in glacier area and also with the retreats in terminus position. It should be particularly noted that more complex interactions may exist among these influencing factors and a thorough analysis is needed in future studies. ",

During the study period (i.e.，1980/1981-2010/2011)，the decreasing rate of average glacier flow velocity was $0 . 0 7 ~ \\mathrm { { m / a } }$ and the decreasing rate may be directly or indirectly associated with the glacier retreating and thinning. The annual variation in the directions of glacier flow velocity was less than $1 ^ { \\circ } - 3 ^ { \\circ }$ .Glacier flow velocity was primarily influenced by glacier morphology (glacier area, glacier length,and ice thickness),and the glacier mass balance and climate conditions (air temperature and precipitation） are also significant in influencing glacier flow velocity.For Urumqi Glacier No.1,continuous field observations (e.g., flow velocity, mass balance,and terminus change） are needed in future to further our understanding of the glacier dynamics in the context of climatic warming.
