It is likely that $\\mathsf { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathsf { P } _ { 2 }$ functions as a critical cofactor (or permission factor) with other proteins to regulate multiple cellular processes.The local availability of $\\mathsf { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathsf { P } _ { 2 }$ effector proteins, rather than $\\mathrm { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ itself,can offer both specificity and efficiency of signaling in space and time.This is consistent with the idea of coincidence detection for $\\mathrm { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ (16,86).Therefore, densely packed nanodomains of $\\mathsf { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathsf { P } _ { 2 }$ appear to be unnecessary,although their transient presence and function in facilitating or maintaining the efficiency of some local signaling cannot be excluded.Furthermore, the $\\mathrm { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ diffusion coefficient in the PM inner leaflet was fast in live cells.It was estimated to be ${ \\sim } 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { s }$ by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using BODIPY-TMR-1 $\\mathsf { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathsf { P } _ { 2 }$ in J774A-1 macrophages (87) and ${ \\sim } 0 . 3 { - } 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { s }$ by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) techniques (88,89). This rapid diffusion poses another challenge to producing and maintaining the densely packed functional inositol lipid clusters in live cells. The facts of its high abundance and fast dynamics in the PM indicate a limited need for cells to maintain highly localized, steep $\\mathrm { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 }$ gradients. ",

        "text": "MethodologicalConsiderationsforStudyingPhosphoinositol Lipids in the PM-The single-molecule superresolution approach used in this study opens a new avenue to study phosphoinositol lipids and other macromolecular complexes in the PM.It has the following advantages.First, it provides nanoscale images (up to ${ \\sim } 3 5 \\ – \\mathrm { n m }$ resolution) using light microscopy and, therefore,avoids common caveats relevant to conventional EM,such as harsh sample processing and low labeling efficiency or specificity. Second,it can be applied directly to live cells (Fig.4),and both fine structures and the dynamics of molecule complexes can be imaged under physiological conditions. Third，PALM imaging,combined with proper fluorescent probes and analysis,offers a new way to quantitatively determine molecule concentration/density at nanometer scale by direct molecule counting.Using PAmCherryl,whose single molecular photophysics have been well characterized in detail (40,60,66),we estimated that PI4P, $\\mathrm { P I } ( 4 , 5 ) \\mathrm { P } _ { 2 } ,$ and $\\mathrm { P I } ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) \\mathrm { P } _ { 3 }$ probe densities in the PM are $- 7 4 3$ D ${ \\sim } 1 6 9 5$ ，and ${ \\sim } 4 0 6 / \\mu \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ 5 respectively.Live-cell TIRF imaging with different PH domains (Fig.6) supports that these PH domain-based probes faithfully reflect the dynamic behaviors of inositol lipids in live cells. However,although they have been widely applied in inositol lipid studies in different cells,we cannot exclude the possibility that PH domains may not be able to efficiently access all phosphoinositides (i.e. those phosphoinositides bound by some sequestering proteins) in the PM because of space constraints.
