The variation of the refractive index is generally caused by two factors: (a)the stoichiometric ratio,and (b) the density of the sample.The sample of near-stoichiometric often shows lower refractive index [18]. The low refractive index indicates that the oxidization of Hf atoms in the sample is enhanced. Additionally, the refractive index can also be used as an important indicator to evaluate the density of the $\\mathrm { H f O } _ { 2 }$ sample [9]. The small refractive index implies low density of the sample. However, from the SE spectra,we cannot determine that either the stoichiometry or density is the main factor causing the change of refractive index.

In this region, the S value increases from the S value of $\\mathrm { H f O } _ { 2 }$ to that of Si (about O.5),which suggests the reduction of Hf content and the increase of Si content.

And it is notably that the S value of the samples deposited under 1Oo W is O.4736 as the positron energy increased to $2 5 . 1 8 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ ，which is smaller than that of Si.

In this uniform region of $\\mathrm { H f O } _ { 2 }$ layer, the S value decreases as the sputtering power.

Additionally,the S value of the sample deposited at 1Oo W can be estimated as of about 0.4296, which is similar to that of the sintered HfO2 (0.4328).It is consistent with SE Data.

Another is that the more non-uniform surface may be induced by frequent bombardment of the ions under high pressure.
