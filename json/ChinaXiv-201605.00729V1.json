We detected rearranged transcripts ofIg genes in sorted liver epithelialcels.To exclude the possible contamination ofany other types of cells,we gated on the larger liver cells when $\\mathrm { C K 1 8 ^ { + } }$ liver cells were sorted.As expected,rearranged functional heavychainand light chain transcripts ofIgG,IgM,IgDand IgA,but not IgE,havebeen found in the sortedliver epithelialcels.Sequencing analysis revealed that similar to Bcels,the liver epithelial cells derived V(D)J or VJ showed classical Ig gene rearrangement patrns and had typical N/P additions among the V, D andJsegments.Moreover,liver epithelial cell-derived IgAand IgG,but not IgMand IgD,also tended to show hypermutation.However,in the same liver epithelial cell population of $\\mathbf { \\bar { \\mu } } \\mathbf { M T }$ mice,each Ig heavychain,including $\\mu , \\delta , \\gamma , \\alpha$ ,showed distinctive variable region sequences, but not the same VDJ sequences.This finding suggests that class switching does not occur in liver epithelial cells,unlike the classical conceptof class switching when IgMswitches to IgA,IgG or IgE,only the constant region (not the variable region containing the VDJ sequences) is replaced.Indeed,we also found that non-Bcels lack class switch mechanisms inour previous studies6.This finding suggests that te mechanismofIg production in non-Bcells is different from thatin Bcels,although the mechanism remains unknown.
