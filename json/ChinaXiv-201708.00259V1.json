Magnesium and neon isotopes are studied and detailed results are presented for the deformed neutron-rich and weakly bound nucleus $^ { 4 4 }$ Mg.The core of this nucleus is prolate,but the halo has a slightly oblate shape.

The deformation of the halo is in this case solely determined by the intrinsic structure of the weakly bound orbitals.Indeed，halos in deformed nuclei were investigated in several mean field calculations in the past [9-11]. However,in Ref.[12],it has been concluded that in the neutron orbitals of an axially deformed Woods-Saxon potential the lowest- $\\ell$ component becomes dominant at large distances from the origin and therefore all $\\Omega ^ { \\pi } = 1 / 2 ^ { + }$ levels do not contribute to deformation for binding energies close to zero. Such arguments raise doubt about the existence of deformed halos. In addition,a three-body model study [13] suggests that it is unlikely to find halos in deformed drip line nuclei because the correlations between the nucleons and those due to static or dynamic deformations of the core inhibit the formation of halos.

Spherical nuclei with halos have been described in the past successfully in this way by the solution of either the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)[14-16] or the relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov (RHB）equations [17-19] in coordinate ( $r$ ）space.However, for deformed nuclei the solution of HFB or RHB equations in $r$ space is a numerically very demanding task.

        "text": "In summary, the very neutron-rich deformed nucleus $^ { 4 4 }$ Mg is investigated within deformed relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov theory in the continuum.In contrast to several expectations [12,13] a pronounced deformed neutron halo is found.It is formed by several orbitals close to the threshold (either weakly bound or in the continuum). They have large components of low $\\ell$ -values and feel therefore only a small centrifugal barrier.Although $^ { 4 4 }$ Mg and its core are well deformed and prolate, the deformation of the halo is slightly oblate. This implies a decoupling between the deformations of core and halo. This mechanism is investigated by studying the details of the neutron densities for core and halo, the single particle levels in the canonical basis,and the decomposition of the halo orbitals.We also studied the weakly-bound nuclei in Ne isotopes and discussed the conditions for the occurence of a halo and its shape.It is shown that the existence and the deformation of a possible neutron halo depends essentially on the quantum numbers of the main components of the single particle orbits in the vicinity of the Fermi surface.
