This is the way to determine the temperature at which the green color intensity is the highest. The test section should be also equipped with thermocouples which measure the temperature along the flow and on the channel walls.In order to trigger the heat flux,it is necessary to have a temperature difference between the gas and the channel walls.In this experiment the hot air was introduced into the channel triggering the heat transfer from the flowing gas to the surfaces of the channel walls. As the time was passing, the liquid crystals located on the wall surface were heated up and finally changed their color. Knowing the material properties of the channel walls,the local temperatures and also the time which passed from the start of the measurement (i.e. the moment of introduction of hot air into the channel) to reach the wall temperature activating the green color, one can determine the heat transfer coefficient. The 3CCD camera recorded images during the measurement to determine time $t$ at which the green intensity peak was achieved.The recorded frames were analyzed by means of our own automated MATLAB code. The software [12] for searching the time of the green intensity peak in every pixel was developed. Having the above information it was possible to determine the heat transfer coefficient $h$ distribution on the wall. ",

Generally,we can say that a high level of turbulence can be observed in the channel with the aspect ratio 1:4, which isrelatively narrow. The average turbulence intensityisatalevelofabout $10 \\%$ .Ahighlevel of turbulence on the one side supports the heat exchange,but slightly increases the losses in the channel flow on the other side.

        "text": "Â· A model of an internal cooling channel of a gas turbine blade was manufactured and equipped with imaging and necessary systems for heat transfer and aerodynamic measurements;   \nÂ· The method of heat exchange measurements in a cooling channel of a gas turbine blade was based on the transient liquid crystal technique.The transient method is not expensive in implementation and its biggest advantage is that there is no need to achieve stable conditions in wall temperature;   \nÂ·A comparison of heat exchange with aerodynamic measurement (flow patternï¼‰ in the ribbed channel was made;   \nÂ· Ribs on the suction and pressure side walls create a specific flow structure with two dominant vortices along the channel with the opposite sense of rotation;   \nÂ·A high level of turbulence (average turbulence intensity of about $10 \\%$ ï¼‰in the ribbed and narrow channels was observed;   \nÂ· The heat transfer coefficient distribution on the walls is highly correlated with the vortex pattern and the stagnation pressure distribution in the channel;   \nÂ· The heat transfer strongly increases in areas where local velocity (stagnation pressure) is higher. On the sidewalls these are areaswhere the flowisdirected towards the wall. On the ribbed walls these are areas just downstream of the rib and this side of the corner where the flow in the vortex is upcoming to that corner. The heat transfer decreases considerably upstream of the next rib and the opposite corner;   \nÂ· In the radial cooled passage channel of the turbine blade the differences in the heat transfer between the suction side and pressure side can appear due to the local small asymmetry of the flow field.
