Human infections by SARS-CoV-2 lead to diseases ranging from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and even death. And in the current situation, better understanding of the virology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 would be vital for the efforts to control the infections and develop effective therapies. RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved antiviral immune mechanism in diverse eukaryotic organisms,and numerous viruses have been found to encode their own viral suppressors of RNAi(VSRs) as countermeasures.In this study, we uncovered that the nucleocapsid (N) protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 effectively suppressed RNAi triggered by either small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in cultured human cells. Furthermore, similar with VSRs encoded by other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 N protein shows double-stranded RNA(dsRNA)-binding activity, as it interacted with in vitro transcribed dsRNAs in human cells. Taken together, our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 N exhibits the VSR activity in human cells, which could be as a key immune evasion factor for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to its pathogenicity. ",

Among six pathogenic species of coronavirus, CoV-229E, CoVOC43, CoV-NL63 and CoV-HKU1 typically cause mild symptoms,whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV） and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused severe respiratory disease outbreaks in the past two decades [1,3,4]. Since December 2019, an outbreak of mysterious pneumonia has been reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On early January 2020, the causative agent of the mysterious viral pneumonia had been identified and isolated as a novel coronavirus by several Chinese institutions at Wuhan and Beijing. This novel coronavirus was initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and later as SARS-CoV-2, while the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is named as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to clinical observations, SARS-CoV-2 infections can cause diseases ranging from mild symptoms to severe respiratory syndromes, including pneumonia, and even death,and its human-to-human transmission had also been confirmed [5,6]. So far, the Covid-19 outbreak has been reported to cause more than 76,Oo0 confirmed cases, and has been declared by WHO as a global public health emergency. ",

        "text": "RNAi is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved in all eukaryotes and has been recognized as a cell-intrinsic antiviral immune defense mechanism in diverse eukaryotes including mammals [7]. In antiviral RNAi, viral infection and replication generates virus-derived dsRNA (vi-dsRNA), which could be recognized and cleaved by the host endoribonuclease Dicer into virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs). These vsiRNAs are integrated into the Argonaute protein within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to direct the destruction of cognate viral RNAs in infected cells in a sequence-specific manner [8]. As a countermeasure, viruses encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize the RNAi pathway at different steps [9]. Nodamura virus (NoV) B2, Influenza A virus (IAV) NS1, human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 3A, Dengue virus 2 (DENV2) NS2A,and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) Capsid have been identified to act as VSRs to inhibit vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi response in the context of authentic viral infections [1O-15]. In addition, Wuhan Nodavirus (WhNV) B2, Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35,HIV-1 TAT, Hepacivirus core and NS2, Yellow Fever virus capsid, Chikungunya virus nsP2 and nsP3,have been found to suppress RNAi in vitro [16-22]. The phenomena of numerous viruses encoding VSRs to suppress the RNAi pathway highlight the importance of antagonizing antiviral RNAi during viral life cycle. Therefore, the understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with antiviral RNAi is important for the better knowledge of this novel coronavirus,and may contribute to the efforts of controlling the spread of infections and developing effective therapies.

Our finding demonstrated that SARSCoV-2 N does possess the VSR activity to inhibit RNAi response in cells,which probably acts as one of the key immune evasion factors of SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to its pathogenicity, thereby representing a potential target for antiviral therapy.

To this end, we co-transfected chemically synthesized EGFP-specific siRNA together with the plasmid for SARS-CoV-2 N into EGFP-expressing 293T cells. And the effects of RNAi were determined via fluorescent microscopy and Western blotting to detect EGFP protein expression, or via Northern blotting to detect EGFP mRNA level. EGFPspecific siRNA reduced the protein and mRNA levels of EGFP,while the ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 N efficiently restored the expression of EGFP in both the protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3A-C). Consistent with previous findings, EBOV VP35, which was used as a positive control, also restored the expression of EGFP in both protein and mRNA levels as expected (Fig. 3B and 3C).

Our findings showed that SARS-CoV（2 $2 \\ : \\mathrm { N }$ can antagonize RNAi in both initiation (i.e. siRNA biogenesis) and effector (i.e. RISC assembly and target RNA cleavage) steps. Therefore, our data support the notion that N protein can act as the VSR to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication by shielding viral dsRNA and siRNA from Dicer cleavage and RISC assembly, respectively. The finding that SARS-CoV-2 N suppresses RNAi in cells is consistent with the previous observation that SARS-CoV N also displayed VSR activity [23],implying that using N protein as the VSR is a common strategy for coronaviruses to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Moreover, in addition to N protein, previous study has identified SARSCoV 7a could suppress RNAi in mammalian cells [25], suggesting that coronaviruses may antagonize RNAi by encoding multiple VSRs. Having multiple VSRs is not uncommon, as several other RNA viruses, such as EBOV, DENV,and HIV-1 also have been reported to encode more than one VSRs [21, 22, 26-30]. Encoding multiple VSRs may offer these pathogenic viruses extra advantages for efficient inhibition of RNAi, highlighting the importance of antiviral RNAi for host cells in defending viral infection.
