This could be due to trapping effects,with traps decreasing the current [26]. It could also be due to the reorientation or migration of ions [27-29]. Under the external bias,the ion reorientation or migration could form a reverse electric field,leading to the reduced current.When the bias is increased to $_ { 5 \\vee }$ ，the situation becomes different.After a quick decrease,a rapid increase of the current appears. This observation is less likely to be caused by traps or ions reorientation. Instead,it could be well understood by considering ions migration in perovskite.Actually,this observation is quite similar to that in LECs [28],where the increase of the current is ascribed to doping of the polymer following theformation ofelectric doublelayers [27,29,3O]. We propose that similar mechanisms might be involved in our perovskite solar cells.After the electrical double layer formation,halide ions might help the doping of perovskites or even improve the interface properties and hence increase the current. In addition, the rather large injection current under $5 \\mathrm { V }$ may destroy the device,which agrees with the results in Fig.3.Since the ion migration beyond the electric double layer formation is detrimental to the device performance,the positive effect of the external bias on the device performance is only obtained during the electric double layer formation process,and hence might be short-lived.

        "text": "In summary,we found that the performance of perovskite solar cells could be strongly dependent on the external bias.Byapplyinga $3  { \\mathrm { V } }$ bias on the device prior to the measurement and extending the scan range to $- 0 . 5$ to $6  { \\mathsf { V } }$ ，the PCE could be significantly increased from $< 1 \\%$ to over $8 \\%$ .Great attention should be paid to the effect of external bias on perovskite solar cells in future studies. Based ona range of experiments,including XRD,SEM,dark current transients,and impedance spectroscopy,we propose that ion motion under the external electric field might be responsible for our observation,although we cannot completely exclude other contributions from ferroelectricity or traps.Future work should aim at decreasing the ionic transport in perovskite solar cells,and hence improve the reproducibility and stability of the devices.
