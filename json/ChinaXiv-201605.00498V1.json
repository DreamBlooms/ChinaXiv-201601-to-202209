Miscanthus $\\times$ giganteus was grown in pots irrigated with nine different NaCl concentrations (0,2.86, 5.44,7.96, 10.65, 14.68, 17.5, 19.97 and $2 2 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { d } S \\ \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ ).Biomass yield was reduced by $5 0 \\%$ at $1 0 . 6 5 ~ \\mathrm { d } \\mathsf { S } \\mathrm { ~ m } ^ { - 1 }$ NaCl. Root dry mater inhibition occurredatthe highest saltconcentration tested,while rhizome dry weight and theratios of root/rhizome and below-/above-ground dry matter were not affcted by elevated salinity.The accumulative effect of increasing salinity reduced stem height and elongation,while photosynthesis was reduced toasmaller extent.The duration and strength of salinity exacerbated the reduction.Water use eficiency(WUE) was maintained except at the highest salinity and plants maintained stomatal conductance $( g _ { \\mathrm { s } } )$ and leaf water content at low to moderate salinity. Miscanthus $\\times$ giganteus showed strong induction of the osmoprotectant, proline and no significant increase in malondialdehyde content under increasing salinity.The ash content in leaves,increased, reducing the biomass qualityathigh salinity concentrations.The effects of salinityon the yield and the availability of land area in European geographical area for agriculture were investigated. Understanding the potential for growth of the C4 biomasscrop Miscanthus on underutilized or abandoned land may offer a new range of targets for improved economics, crop management and breeding. ",

Initially，the water potentialislowered,and the plant experiences an osmotic stress similar to drought associated with concentrated solutes in the root zone.The subsequent ionic imbalance as salts perturb the uptake of nutrients and the accumulation of ions over time is the main cause of toxicity (Munns et al.，1995;Flowers & Flowers,2005; Verslues et al.,2O06).Many different traits contribute to salinity tolerance,which are species and developmental stage dependent (Munns，20o2；Flowers & Flowers, 2005;Jones et al.,2015).

Potentially,a combination of drought and salt tolerance would enable the plant to cope with the different components of salt stress.To describe the response of plants to salinity stress,Maas & Hoffman (1977)introduced the concept of the salt tolerance threshold as the level of salinity over which yield is reduced significantly in a biphasic trend.The threshold level is responsive to environmental factors,andtherefore,itisnot static for each crop (Volkmar et al.，1998)，thus requiring controlled conditions to obtain accurate threshold values (Shannon, 1985).
