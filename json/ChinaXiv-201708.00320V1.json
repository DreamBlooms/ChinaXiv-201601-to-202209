The cosmic gamma-ray flux in the same processcan be significant around 30o GeV,thus can be observed or constrained by the forthcoming Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma-ray data.The collider signal at the LHC is the resonance in the dijets channels and the large missing energy in the missing energy plus jets.

All standard model fields are universally propagating through the 5D bulk so that their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excited states are phenomenologically important if the compactification scale is low $( 1 / R \\ \\sim \\ \\mathrm { T e V } .$ ).The model has an underlying symmetry,called the KK parity, that prevents the lightest KK odd state to decay. If such a state is neutral,then it provides a viable dark matter candidate.In the minimal setup, the gauge group is the same as the standard model one, $G = \\mathrm { S U ( 3 ) _ { c } \\times S U ( 2 ) _ { W } \\times U ( 1 ) _ { Y } }$ . Quarks and leptons are also alleviated to higher dimensional ones and theirKK spectra are doubled.One chirality of their zero modes is projected out by the orbifold condition,leaving the other one as the standard model fermions. The most prominent feature of split-UED is the presence of (double） kink masses for fermions while keeping the KK parity. The five dimensional action of split-UED is the same as the minimal UED(MUED) except the 5D bulk mass terms: ",
