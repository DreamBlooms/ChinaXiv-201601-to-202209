        "text": "Abstract: Since 1960,the steppe regions of North Africa have been subject to an increasing desertification, including the degradation of traditional pastures.The initiallydominant species (Artemisia berba-alba,Lygeum spartum and Stipa tenacissimad)declined and were progressively replacedby other species (Atractyliserratuloides and Salsola vermiculata) that are more tolerant to the new conditions. It is not clear whether these changes are due to anthropogenic reasons or climatic determinism. We have carried out a statistical analysis of the climate to detect putative rainfall changes during the $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century in the Algerian steppes based on data from 9 meteorological stations, including 2 Saharan stations (El Oued and Touggourt), 3 pre-Saharan stations (Biskra,Laghouat and Ain Sefra) and 4 steppe stations (Djelfa, Saida, Méchéria and El-Bayadh) located in the arid high plains, which represent the bioclimate diversities of the region. Previous studies suggested that significant rainfall changes for the $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century only had records in the south of the Oran region. Most of the studies,however,looked at restricted territories over limited periods,and did not integrate the rainiest period 2004-2014. Our work is designed to integrate allthe longest time series of meteorological data available for the steppe regions of Algeria. Our results confirm the spatial rainfall distribution (significant rainfall changes only recorded in the southwestern region) evidenced by previous studies,and reveal a decreasing rainfal gradient from northeastern to southwestern Algeria. Moreover, the results reveal a trend of significant decrease of rainfallin the southern Oran region, marked by two drought periods in $1 9 8 0 -$ 1985 and 1999-2003. However, with the exception of the southwestern region, rainfall overall has not declined since the beginning of the $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century. While less marked in other regions, the drought appear to have affected al territories of the Algerian steppe. Consequently,our study implies that the climate was not a leading influence in the on-going degradation of the vegetation cover of steppe landscapes. Such a vegetation evolution thus appears to be have been determined more by human activities than by climate forcing. ",

        "text": "It is generally accepted that the causes of desertification are related to anthropogenic activities and environmental factors, mainly climate forcing. The relative importance of these factors has long been debated. An initial and enduring school of thought, enhanced by Le Houerou, focused on human activities. His paradigm can be summarized by two expressions: 'man-made deserts' and 'man is not the son but the father of deserts' (Le Houérou, 1989; Reynolds et al., 2OO7). Another school of thought, based largely on the experience of drought in Sahel, considers that climate is the most decisive factor impacting rangelands both in the short (Nicholson, 2OO0, 2005; Herrmann et al., 2005a, b; Herrmann and Hutchinson, 20O5; Gonzalez et al., 2012) and long term (Lhote, 1975; Muzzolini, 1993).

Numerous researchers have discussed the roles of overgrazing and drought on desertification in the Saharan margins (Djebaili, 1978; Le Houérou, 1989,1996; Aidoud et al., 1998; Nedjraoui, 2003; Benbrahim et al., 2004; Hanafi and Jaufret, 2008; Hirche, 2010; Slimani et al., 2010). The Algerian steppe zone is the sheep homeland and plays a major economic role (Hirche et al., 2O11; Hourizi et al., 2017). It is crucial to explore the causes and process of desertification. According to MARA (1974) and BNEDER (2O06), the area of Algerian steppe increased from $2 . 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ to $2 7 . 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \\mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ in about 25 years. Studies (Djebaili, 1978; Le Houérou, 1989, 1996; Aidoud et al., 1998; Nedjraoui, 2003; Hirche, 2O10; Slimani et al., 2O10) suggested that the desertification was mainly caused by human activities, such as agriculture and grazing.

        "text": "However, previous studies produced no evidence of obvious climate change in Algeria between 1900 and 1970 (Djellouli, 1981, Daget and Djellouli, 1991)，which was also supported by Le Houérou (1996). Later studies (Meddi and Hubert, 2003; Meddi and Meddi, 2004, 2007, 2009a, b; Slimani et al.,2010) revealed that the drought periods started since the 198Os, which had dramatic consequences on the steppe rangelands, particularly in the southern Oran region of northwest Algeria). Based on the data from 8 meteorological stations from 1907 to 2003, Hirche et al. (2007) dealed with the evolution of annual precipitation at a larger spatial scale,and extended the interest to the entire arid steppe region of Algeria. The results show that only the southwestern Oran region displays a significant climate trend towards drought. If the aridification of the southern Oran region persists or increases, the predominance of the anthropozoic influence could be challenged. Climate could then be given the leading role as in the Sahel (Gagnol and Soubeyran, 2O12). But the last decade was relatively wet in Algeria, which raises some questions: What is the present-day climate situation? Did these wet years change the decreasing trend observed by Hirche et al. (2O07)? Has the rainfall trend changed since then? ",

The main climatic parameters influencing aridity in Algeria are rainfall intensity and frequency, which are conditioned by two geographical gradients. One is a north-south gradient, with rainfall decreasing southwards. Indeed, the Tell Atlas Mountain and the Saharan Atlas retain a large amount of water brought by clouds and leave the corridor area corresponding to the steppe relatively dry. Another one is the air masses dried by their displacement on the Spanish mainland, reach the North West Africa and spread to its eastern part., the air masses regain moisture as they move and result in greater rainfall in the eastern regions (Djellouli, 1981).

These regional differences were not sufficiently emphasized in the literature apart from some works, such as Meddi and Meddi (2O09a) and Barakat and Handoufe (1998). Those studies suggest that the drought of arid lands increases towards the west. In fact, the central and eastern regions of Algeria do not seem to have been affected by such a significant drought over the long term. In the short term, the recurrence of drought periods is clearly more prominent after the 197Os in all stations, with different durations and intensities. Otherwise, the period 1942-1945 is considered to be the most important drought period during the first part of the century. This particularly dry period (1940-1950) is referred to as one of \"misery and famine\" coinciding with World War II.

By contrast， Morocco seems particularly affected by the drought (Gravier and Weisrock, 1986; Meddi and Meddi, 2O04). There is an expansion of dry farming over the past twenty years, which suggests the hypothesis of an aridification gradient towards the west.

If the coming years are still wet, it is likely that the drying trend disappears even in southern Oran. This highlights the relativity of the notion of trend and the importance of the investigated period. Ultimately, although there does not appear to be a statistically significant change in rainfall, the detailed study of its distribution shows that rainfallis irregular during the century and the frequency of droughts has increased in the last decades.

        "text": "The rangelands of the southern Oran region have a major economic importance since they are home to the main part of the national livestock. During the last thirty years,the difference between supply and demand for fodder resources has increased, leading to overgrazing which has directly impacted rangelands that have progressively declined. The southern Oran rangelands are continuous with the eastern Moroccan steppes, which have experienced the same trend of decreasing rainfall (Mahyou et al., 201O; Mahyou, 2012). ",

        "text": "This work provides the first reconstruction of the 100-year evolution of rainfall(1900-2014) at the scale of the Algerian steppes, including the high plains, pre-Saharan, and Saharan regions. Despite limited available reliable meteorological data, which constrains the scope of our conclusions, the results are fairly convergent and seem consistent and show a decadal variability of rainfall in the entire steppe region, and a tendency to aridification only in the southwestern steppe region, with three particularly dry periods in 1940-1950, 1980-1985 and 1999-2004. Moreover, the period 1900-1972 is generally more humid with wet periods alternating with dry periods more regularly, and the period 1973-2O14 is drier. The regional vegetation degradation (expansion of grazingtolerant plant formations replacing the initial steppes of alfa, esparto and sagebrush) consequently appears not to have been triggered by climate change but rather by the strong contemporary increase in human activities, livestock and barley production.
