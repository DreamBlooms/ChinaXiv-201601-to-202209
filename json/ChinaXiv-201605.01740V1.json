        "text": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1） is abnormally expressed in many cancers. In this study,we showed that TRAP1 is aberrantly upregulated in breast tumors compared to control tissues. TRAP1 knockdown downregulates mitochondrial aerobic respiratory,sensitizes cells to lethal stimuli, and inhibited tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vivo.TRAP1 overexpression, however, enhances the capacity to cope with stress conditions. These evidences suggested that TRAP1 is required for tumorigenesis.We also found that TRAP1 regulates the mitochondrial morphology. Relatively lower TRAP1 levels are associated with the rod-shaped mitochondrial phenotype in invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; on the contrary, higher TRAP1 levels are associated with the tubular network-shaped mitochondrial phenotype in non-invasive MCF-7 cells.Interestingly, the expression of TRAP1 in human breast cancer specimens inversely correlates with tumor grade. Overexpression of TRAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells causes mitochondrial fusion, triggers mitochondria to form tubular networks,and suppresses cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. These data link TRAP1- regulated mitochondrial dynamics and function with tumorigenesis of breast cancer and suggested that TRAP1 may therefore be a potential target for breast cancer drug development.

They are essential for maintaining aspects of physiology such as cellular energy balance, metabolism,modulation of calcium signaling and the intrinsic apoptosis pathway; it also defines cellular redox balance and regulates important biosynthetic pathways. Dysregulation of mitochondria impairs mitochondrial function, leading to disease or tumor development [5]. Since mitochondrial function is also crucial for certain types of cancer cells,particularly under low glucose conditions commonly observed in solid tumors [6,7], targeting cancer cell mitochondria might be a novel strategy for the treatment of cancer[8].Anticancer agents that specifically target the cancer cell mitochondria are denoted as“mitocans\".This group of drugs is represented by redox-silent vitamin analogs [9,1O] that disrupt the normal functioning of mitochondrial complex I1. This disruption causes inhibition of ATP generation that eventually leads to apoptosis in cancer cells.In addition,inhibitors of mitochondrial complexI(NADH dehydrogenase),such as metformin[11] and phenformin [6],also show anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo.

TRAP1 overexpression creates a resistance to stress stimuli and protects human cancer cells from apoptosis [13,21,23-29]；it is also associated with chemotherapy response and overall survival in ovarian and colorectal cancers [20, 3O],human esophageal squamous cell cancer [31] and non-small cell lung cancer [32].However, the role of TRAP1 in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasisremains elusive.

The compensatory increased recruitment ofHsp9O to mitochondria was also observed in TRAP1-knockout mice as well as in TRAP-1-silencing prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells [53].Human Hsp90 proteins are molecular chaperones that include $\\mathrm { H s p 9 0 a }$ $\\mathrm { H s p 9 0 \\beta }$ ,Grp94,and TRAP1[54].They forma chaperone network in mitochondria and other organelles and have been linked to an adaptation to unfavorable environments. Considering that Hsp9O that has been recruited to the mitochondria might compensate for TRAP1,drugs that target to the mitochondria and inhibit the Hsp9O family members will be more efficient in the prevention of TRAP1-related tumorigenesis.

TRAP1- overexpressing cells are more resistant to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis [23, 29,37,38].

Cancer cells face a considerable metabolic challenge as they divide and grow uncontrollably, thus resulting in a drastic adjustment of many metabolic pathways.Cancer cells often exhibit an increased rate of glycolysis,known as the Warburg effect [4O],which is regarded as an important hallmark of cancer [41].TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis [42],probably by binding to the succinate dehydrogenase of the complex I of the respiratory chain [13]. The respiratory downregulation elicited by TRAP1 primes the succinate-dependent stabilization of the transcription factor HIF1α,and promotes neoplastic growth and tumorigenesis [43].However, the function of TRAP1 in mitochondrial metabolism is more complex, asa large body of literature shows that pharmacologic or genetic targeting of TRAP1 inhibited mitochondrial respiration [44，45],impaired mitochondrial quality control [46],and suppressed ATP production [32].By monitoring mitochondrial aerobic respiratory in real time, we provide direct evidences here that TRAP1 is required for the oxidative phosphorylation of breast cancer cells, under both normal and nutrient-deficient conditions.Thus, we suggest that TRAP1 is of crucial importance for cancer cells,particularly under low glucose conditions commonly observed in solid tumors.

TRAP1expression inverselycorrelates with tumor grade in breast cancers；moreover, levels of TRAP1 were lower in invasive breast cancer cell lines than in non-invasive cell lines.These data were consistent with previous reports that down-regulation of TRAP1 dramatically enhances invasion in mouse and human cell lines [42,47,48].Metastasis of cancer cells requires an abundance of ATP [49-51]. Our recent report links mitochondrial morphology with the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells [33].When mitochondrial morphology wasmanipulated, the subcellular distribution of mitochondria was altered,and breast cancer cell migration and invasion was decreased.Metastatic MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells express relatively low level ofTRAP1,and their mitochondria were more fragmented (rod-shaped).Upon chemoattractant exposure, the rodshaped mitochondria were recruited to lamellipodial regions,where they generate ATP and contributed to the assembly of F-actin filaments.However,when weoverexpressed TRAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, phosphorylated Drp1 at Ser616 site [52] was downregulated and Mfn1 was up-regulated, the mitochondria were transformed into tubular networks,the subcellular distribution of mitochondria to the lamellipodia was blocked,and,as a result,the abilityof cells to invade and metastasize were inhibited. On the contrary, nonmetastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cells express high level of TRAP1,and their mitochondria were tubular networkshaped.Based on these evidences,we hypothesized that the inversely correlation between metastatic abilities and TRAP1 levels might be due to the impact of TRAP1 on mitochondrial dynamics.
