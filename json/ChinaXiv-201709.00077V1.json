Reactor [3] and accelerator [4] neutrino experiments have further confirmed the oscillation paradigm. Nowadays, the fact that neutrinos do oscillate between different flavors has been established. The original idea of neutrino oscillation was proposed by Pontecorvo [5] assuming neutrino-antineutrino oscillation in a pattern similar to that between $K ^ { 0 }$ and $K ^ { 0 }$ ． This idea was extended to be among different flavors of neutrinos by Maki, Nakgawa and Sakada [6]. One of the key point (MSW effect） in the neutrino oscillation paradigm is due to Wolfenstein [7]. Mikheyev and Smirnov [8] who pointed out an effect induced by matter when a neutrino passes through it and interacts with the particles forming the matter. Now it is well known that massive neutrinos naturally result in neutrino oscillations among different flavors. It is also noteworthy that other mechanisms, like Lorentz symmetry violation [9,10],can also accommodate neutrino oscillations. There have been many papers discussing neutrino oscillations using Lorentz violation in the literature [11]. ",

In this letter,we still work in the conventional massive neutrino paradigm which solves the solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino problems. To explain the MINOS anomaly,a Lorentz and CPT violating term is included as perturbation. We adopt a framework called Standard Model Extension (SME) [9, 22].
