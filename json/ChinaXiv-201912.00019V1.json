The effects of saline water irrigation (O.0O,2.93,8.78 and $1 7 . 5 5 ~ \\mathrm { g / L }$ NaCl solutions) on water transport and water use efficiency (WUE) of $P .$ eupbratica saplings were researched for improving the survival of $P .$ eupbratica saplings and vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid areas of Xinjiang, China in 2011. Results showed that hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation of $P .$ eupbratica saplings were more sensitive in root xylem than in twig xylem when irigation water salinity increased. Irrigation with saline water concentration less than $8 . 7 8 ~ \\mathrm { g / L }$ did not affect the growth of $P .$ （204号 eupbratica saplings, under which they maintained normal water transport in twig xylem through adjustment of anatomical structure of vessels and kept higher WUE and photosynthesis in leaves through adjustment of stomata. However, irrigation with saline water concentration up to $1 7 . 5 5 ~ \\mathrm { g / L }$ severely inhibited the photochemical process and WUE of $P .$ eupbratica saplings, resulting in severe water-deficit in leaves and a sharp reduction in water transport in xylem. Thus,it is feasible to irrigate $P .$ eupbratica forest by using saline groundwater for improving the survival of $P .$ eupbratica saplings and vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid areas of Xinjiang, China.

        "text": "Soil salinization is a global concern, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas (Evelin et al.,2009; Parihar et al.,2O15; Baath etal.,2O17). The total area of salt-affected soils in the world, including saline and sodic soils currently comprising approximately $8 . 3 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ , is continually increasing (Martinez-Beltran and Manzur, 2OO5; Nikolskii-Gavrilov et al.,2O15; Mehdi-Tounsi et al., 2017). Salt stress is one of the most critical factors hindering the growth and development of plants, especially due to excess $\\mathrm { { N a ^ { + } } }$ (FAO,2008; Baath et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017). This is because high salt concentrations,especially of $\\mathrm { { N a ^ { + } } }$ and $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ ，decrease the osmotic potential of soil solution, thereby lowering the availability of water to plants and resulting in dehydration stress of plants (Brinker et al.,2010). Moreover, excess $\\mathrm { { N a ^ { + } } }$ concentration negatively affects plant nutrition and ion homeostasis (Shabala and Cuin,2Oo8).High $\\mathbf { C l } ^ { - }$ concentration interferes with ${ \\bf N O } _ { 3 } { } ^ { - }$ and $\\mathrm { H P O } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ absorption in plants,causing nutrient imbalances and negatively-affected carbohydrate transportation (Apostol et al., 2O04; López-Perez et al., 20O7). Since most plant species have very limited capacities to cope with excess $\\mathrm { { N a ^ { + } } }$ ， productivity of saline soil is greatly diminished and plant growth may even become impossible (Brinker et al., 2O1O). The adaptive mechanisms of salt-tolerant species have attracted considerable research interests in recent years (Munns,2005; Yamaguchi and Blumwald, 2005; Munns and Tester, 2008; Chen and Polle, 2010; Wang et al., 2016; Baath et al., 2017; Mehdi-Tounsi et al., 2017).

Water uptake,transport and use in roots,xylem and leaves constitute the complete water path and play important roles in the survival of terrestrial vascular plants. However, researches regarding water transport and water use efficiency(WUE) in salt-tolerant plants is still limited,and the related studies have been restricted to the effects of mild salt stress over short time periods (from a few minutes to $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ or a few days)(Guo et al.，2006; Horie et al.， 2011； Muries et al.， 2011； Sutka et al.,2011; Calvo-Polanco et al.,2O14).

        "text": "Populus euphratica Oliv. is distributed from northwestern Africa, western South Asia to Central Asia (Browicz,1977).In fact, $P .$ euphratica growing on river banks or areas with deep Water tables in China accounts for $54 \\%$ of the whole areas in the world (Hukin et al.,2005; Zhuang et al., 2010). In Xinjiang, $P .$ euphratica accounts for $89 \\%$ of the areas in China (Chen et al.,2006). The groundwater salinity is $3 . 0 0 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 0 . 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g / L }$ ,or even reaches up to $1 0 . 0 0 { - } 3 0 . 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g / L }$ in some areas in Xinjiang (Wang et al., 2010). $P .$ euphratica is a salt-tolerant species that can grow in saline environments (Sixto et al., 2005; Fu et al., 201O; Rajput et al., 2016). Thus, $P .$ euphratica is an optimal woody tree utilized for vegetation restoration due to the limited water resources and high salinity of groundwater in arid and semi-arid areas (Abassi et al.,2O14). In this study, we studied the effects of saline water irrigation(O.OO,2.93,8.78 and $1 7 . 5 5 \\ \\mathrm { g / L } \\mathrm { N a C l }$ solutions） on the water transport and WUE of $P .$ euphratica saplings for three months and tried to answer the following scientific questions:(1） how saline water changes the water transport in xylem and WUE in leaves when $P .$ euphratica saplings are irrigated by saline water? And (2) what is the saline water threshold that $P .$ euphratica maintains its normal growth? ",

The PVC pipes （ $3 2 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ in diameter and $7 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ in depth with an artificially sealed bottom） were filled with approximately $6 0 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ soil.

        "text": "Studies have reported that mild salt stress over a short-term (from a few minutes to $2 4 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ or a few days）period could facilitate the activity or function of aquaporins (AQPs）or increase the accumulation of osmotic adjustments for increasing $K$ (Guo et al.，2006;Horie et al.,2011; Muries et al.,2011； Sutka et al.,2011; Calvo-Polanco et al.,2014;Meng and Fricke,2017). However, other studies demonstrated that high concentrations of $\\mathrm { { N a C l } }$ in the cytoplasm decreased the activity or concentration of AQPs,leading to a large reduction in root $K$ (Carvajal et al., 2000; Martinez-Ballsta et al.,2003,2008; Nedjimi, 2009,2014). Our study showed that saline water irrigation caused strong decreases in initial and maximum hydraulic conductivities,as well as cavitation resistance of roots (Fig.7). This seemed that saline water irrigation might inhibit the activity/concentration of AQPsor osmotic adjustmentsin the root xylem celsof $P _ { \\cdot }$ . euphratica saplings. Increasing concentration of saline irrgation water also reduced $K$ adjustment range in roots(Fig. 7); moreover, $K$ and vulnerability to cavitationof $P _ { \\cdot }$ . euphratica saplings were more sensitive to salt stress in roots than in twigs. These results demonstrated that the capability of $P .$ euphratica saplings to tolerate saline water irrigation might constitute a root-born process,in which it controlled NaCl ion loading into the xylem by decreasing $K$ in roots (Chen et al., 2003; Sun et al.,2009).

This indicated that xylem in twigs might possess an adjustment mechanism for maintaining high hydraulic efficiency to adapt to mild and moderate salt stresses. Studies found that salt stress could regulate $K$ by changing the anatomical structure of vessels (Ali et al.,1999; López-Perez et al., 2007; Navarro et al., 2007; Silva et al., 2008). According to the Hagen-Poiseuille relationship, $K$ depended on the anatomic structure of xylem (Rajput et al., 2016). Typically,a larger vessel diameter and density were associated with higher $K$ (Bass,1982). However, larger vessel diameters were easier to be embolized, thus hindering water transport in xylem due to narrow vessel wall, low thickness between vessel walls and low mechanical strength of vessel wall (Zimmermann，1983).An LSD or Tukey test indicated that, although vessel diameter in twigs of $S _ { 1 }$ -treated and $\\mathbf { S } _ { 2 }$ -treated plants decreased compared with control plants, the differences were not significant $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ . However, vessel density，vessel wall thickness, thickness between vessel walls and vessel wall mechanical strength in twigs in $S _ { 1 }$ -treated and $S _ { 2 }$ -treated plants significantly increased compared with control plants $( P { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ . These results indicated that $P .$ euphratica saplings could maintain $K$ for the effective water transport in twigs under mild or moderate salt stress by increasing vessel density, vessel wall thickness, and vessel wall mechanical strength for compensating the negative effects of the reduction in vessel diameter On the contrary, the vessel diameter significantly decreased by approximately $10 \\%$ in $S _ { 3 }$ -treated plants compared with control plants ( $( P { < } 0 . 0 5$ ; Fig. 4), but the vessel density, vessel wall thickness, thickness between vessel walls and mechanical strength of vessel wall did not significantly increased ( ${ \\it P } { > } 0 . 0 5$ ； Fig. 4). This result suggested that severe salt stress significantly increased xylem embolism and inhibited $K$ that finally reduced the water transport in twigs. ",
