The bubbles generated from the boiling rGO solutions helped to form porous structure.33 However, the boiling process needs additional equipments and specific substrate (Si, $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ and Pt) for the deposition of macroporous graphene foams,which makes it inconvenient to operate.Hydrothermal method is an easy way to fabricate porous graphene foam,but the pore sizes lie in a wide range from submicrometer to over tens,even hundreds of micrometers,which is uncontrollable,and unsuitable for practical applications.26,6,39,40 Recently, 3D graphenearchitecture with controllable pore structures are fabricated through a novel interface self-assembly method.41 However,gold substrate with surface modification is required to the formation of porous graphene,and only thin porous graphene film with a thickness of ${ \\sim } 1 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ can be obtained.Despite the fact that efforts have been taken to regulate pore sizes of graphene foam during the self-assembly process, it is still not easy to acquire uniform pore size with convenient experimental process.In addition, the reported pore sizes of self-assembled graphene foams in current literatures mainly lie in the dimension of several microns to tens of microns,which are usually too large than required for mass transportation and reduce the utilization rate of pores in various applications,such as energy storage and catalysis.As far as we know, no successful graphene foams with uniform pore size down to nanometer scale have been reported. Hence, paving an easy way for fabrication of graphene foam with controlled pore sizes still presents significant challenges,and new approaches for reasonable design of pore sizes are urgently required for better use of graphene foams.

The typical AFM image of as-prepared LGOs sample is shown in Fig.1a. The height profle in Fig.1a indicates that GO sheets possesses a mean thickness of ${ \\sim } 1 . 0$ nm,corresponding to single layer,and the typical lateral size of L-GOs is larger than $1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .Conventional ultrasonication process was used to achieve GO sheets with smaller size,and the longer the ultrasonication time is,the smaller the GO sheets are.43 Medium-size GO sheets (M-GOs) are prepared by ultrasonicating graphite oxide aqueous dispersions for 5 min with a ultrasonication power of $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ ,and small-size GO sheets (SGOs) are obtained by prolonging the ultrasonication time to $^ { 1 \\mathrm { h } }$ with the same power. The mean thickness of M-GOs (Fig. 1b) and S-GOs (Fig. 1c) are the same as that of L-GOs,suggesting thorough delamination of graphite oxide into single layer GO. Their AFM images also demonstrate that majority of M-GOs have the sheet size of ${ \\sim } 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ，and S-GOs possess much smaller size of hundreds of nanometers.In previous works,it has been reported that the aspect ratio of GO sheets is considered to be akey factor that determines the possible formation of GO liquid crystals (GOLCs).44,45 The individual GO sheets with larger aspect ratio have a stronger tendency to form GOLCs.Due to the remarkable difference of sheet size among three samples with similar thickness,their aspect ratio varies significantly. The corresponding average aspect ratio of L-GOs,M-GOs and SGOs are $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ 5 $2 \\times { 1 0 } ^ { 3 }$ and $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 }$ ，respectively.At a constant concentration of $4 \\mathrm { \\ m g { \\ m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ ,both L-GOs (Fig.S1at) and M-GOs (Fig.S1bt) aqueous dispersions in glass bottles display clear anisotropic textures,typical of GOLCs,whereas S-GOs aqueous dispersion (Fig. $\\mathbf { S 1 c \\dagger } .$ ）has no visual anisotropy，which is suggestive of the absence of anisotropic alignment of such small GO sheets in the solution.To further verify whether liquid crystal is formed in GO suspensions,polarized-light optical microscopy (POM) was employed to detect the characteristic birefringence of possible GOLCs.The POM images of L-GOs (Fig. $\\mathbf { S } 2 \\mathbf { a } \\dagger .$ ）and M-GOs (Fig. S2bt） aqueous dispersions in capillary show typical macroscopic colorful textures,indicating the formation of liquid crystals.In contrast, there is no evident emergence of microscopic birefringence in the POM image of SGOs (Fig. $^ { \\mathrm { S 2 c \\dagger } }$ )，suggesting that small GO sheets with a concentration of $4 { \\mathrm { ~ m g ~ m L } } ^ { - 1 }$ still does not reach the critical point to form liquid crystals.The above results further reflect the obvious difference of sheet size for three GO samples.

It is interesting to find that the volume of graphene foams decreases with the reduction of the sheet size of GO.The pore size of graphene foam also varies a lot along with the change of the sheet size of GObuilding blocks.SEM image (Fig.2a and d) of graphene foam prepared fromL-GOs (named L-GF) shows that it has slitlike pore structures made up of randomly stacked rGO sheets and has pore size of ${ \\sim } 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,similaras the sheet size ofL-GOs. However,at the same magnification,it is vague to see the pore structure of graphene foam derived from M-GOs (named M-GF) in Fig.2b,and we can barely distinguish individual pores of graphene foam obtained using S-GOs (named S-GF) in Fig. 2c.

The pore structures along horizontal and vertical directions are almost identical for asprepared L-,M- and S-GFs,suggesting that pores in all gra phene foams distribute uniformly at a large scale.The above results evidently demonstrate the strong dependence of pore size of graphene foam on the sheet size of GO.

As mentioned above,the large pores inL-GF have anisotropic flat slit-like pore structure.However, the nano-sized pores in S-GF possess isotropic cage-like morphology.The pore structure in M-GF with medium pore size can be regarded as a transition state between L-GF and S-GF. The aspect ratio of GO sheets may be the main reason for the transition of pore morphology. The larger the size of GO,the higher possibility to form anisotropic flat slit-like pore structure. ",

        "text": "Methylene blue (MB) adsorption experiments were carried out to demonstrate the adsorption capability of graphene foams with different pore sizes,and the results are shown in Fig.5.It canbe found that after 18 hours of thermostatic mechanical shaking, the deep blue color of $0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { g } \\ \\mathrm { L } ^ { - 1 }$ original MB solutions contained ${ \\sim } 2 4 . 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ of graphene foams with different pore sizes fadesobviously,which can be identified by eyes.This also can be verified by the UV-vis spectra (Fig.5a).The removal rate of MB was calculated to be $8 8 . 1 \\%$ ， $9 7 . 2 \\%$ and $9 8 . 5 \\%$ forL,M,and S-GF，respectively.There are no significant differencesin adsorption capacity among three samples,which might be the consequences that saturated adsorption capacity was higher than the original concentrations ofMB,so that they can remove almost all MB from solutions.In order to clearly manifest the effect of pore structure of graphene foams on their adsorption performances,the original concentrations of MB solutions were doubled and the weight of graphene foams was decreased to ${ \\sim } 1 4 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ 、Asis shown in Fig.5b,we can identify that the MB solution contained three graphene foams with difference pore sizes show apparently different color fading degrees. The corresponding adsorbed amounts of MB calculated from UV-vis spectra are $9 0 . 7 0 \\mathrm { ~ m g ~ g } ^ { - 1 }$ ， $1 7 5 . 1 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g \\ } \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ and $2 1 5 . 3 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } ~ \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 }$ for $\\mathbf { L } , \\ \\mathbf { M }$ ，and S-GF,respectively.Obviously，the outstanding adsorption abilityof S-GF mainly arises from its extremely high SSAs $( 4 0 1 . 1 8 \\ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \\ \\mathrm { g } ^ { - 1 } )$ ．As mentioned above,GO sheets with smaller size are more effective to avoid the fold and restacking problems,thereby largely preserves the high surface area, acquiring high adsorption capacity.Thus,the exposed surface of rGO sheets is crucial for MB adsorption,and SSA of graphene foam can be referred as an important parameter that determines its adsorption capacities.However,the MB adsorption amount based on unit surface area of graphene foams decreases along with the reduction of their pore sizes,and the corresponding values for L,M,and S-GF are calculated to be $0 . 9 3 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ $\\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ ， $0 . 6 7 ~ \\mathrm { m g } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ ,and $0 . 5 4 ~ \\mathrm { m g } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ , respectively. As all three graphene foams underwent identical reaction processes,which ensures that they possess the same surface properties,the pore sizes of the three graphene foams might be the critical reason that determines the MB adsorption amounts per unit surface area.Largerpores are expected to be favorable for faster mass transfer in respect of diffusion kinetics.Hence more MB molecules can be transferred to the interiorsurface ofL-GF than that of M-GF and S-GF within unit time,resulting in larger adsorption amount of MB per unit surface area before apparent equilibrium is reached.Apparently,the large pores facilitate mass transfer,while the small onesare beneficial for adsorption capacities.
