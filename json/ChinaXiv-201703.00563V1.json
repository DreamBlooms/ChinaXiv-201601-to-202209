The crystal structure of the $\\mathrm { M g O } { \\cdot } n \\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ consists of a cubic cell with $F d 3 m$ symmetry, containing a close-packed array of 32 oxygen atoms with cations in tetrahedral and octahedral interstices[4].Relatively complex structure comparing to those of its constituent oxides $\\mathbf { M g O }$ and $\\scriptstyle \\alpha - \\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ makes the study of defect more difficult. Formation of both anion (F-type center) and cation(V-type center) vacancies is possible by neutron irradiation in spinel single crystals. Studies of irradiation induced point defects such as $\\mathrm { F } \\mathrm { - }$ type centers in $\\mathbf { M g O \\cdot } n \\mathbf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathbf { O } _ { 3 }$ were reported for both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric spinel crystals[4,5,6,7,8]. F-center absorption band shifts towards higher energies in non-stoichiometric spinel crystals because oflattice constant. This shift in absorption band is consistent with Mollvo-Ivey relation[6]. Vibronic F type centers at low temperatures were reported for $\\mathbf { M g O [ 9 ] }$ and $\\alpha { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } [ 1 0 \\$ ，11].

This vibronic band Wasassigned to F center. Physical parameters such as Debye temperature and Huang-Rhys factor were estimated from the temperature dependence of the vibronic excitation band. ",
