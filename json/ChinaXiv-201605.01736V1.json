The resulting images were visually checked to ensure that there were no misclassifications; the modulated normalized GM images that represented gray matter volume (GMV） images were then smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a $6 \\mathrm { - m m }$ full width at half-maximum (FWHM) kernel.Finally, the group difference between the patients and controls of GMV were examined voxel-wise using the two-sample t-test model in SPM with sex and age of subjects added to the model as covariates. Areas of the brain that demonstrated significant differences between groups were thresholded at $P < 0 . 0 0 1$ (cluster size $\\geq$ 40)and visualized in SPM with pseudo-color.

Structural images were coregistered with the mean volume of functional images and subsequently smoothed using an $8 \\mathrm { - m m }$ FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel in SPM8.Cerebral blood flow images of the whole brain were then reconstructed from preprocessed perfusion images using Grocer toolbox (http:// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ext/ $\\#$ Grocer [in the public domain]).

Boucard et al.13 also reported a similar GM density decrease in the anterior part of the calcarine fissure in glaucoma patients,as well as in the occipital poles of those with age-related macular degeneration (AMD),who typically suffer from central visual field loss.In patients with dementia but without glaucoma,retinal neuronal damage as reflected by thinning of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer(GC-IPL) is associated with GM loss in the occipital and temporal lobes.28 The data consistently respect the topographical relationship between brain involvement and retinal neurodegeneration.29 ",

Neurodegeneration in the visual cortex either may represent a state of“dormancy” or may actively participate in the disease progress through deprivation of brain-derived neurotrophic factors.17 In recent years, a retinal prosthesis system (RPS) has been under development as a potentially valuable aid for restoring functional vision in those suffering from partial or total blindness.3² It provides retinal stimulation and transmits the signal via normal visual pathway to the visual cortex. Patients with late-stage glaucoma,as well as other retinal degenerative diseases,may benefit from the visual prosthesis; but whether the brain atrophy in glaucoma could compromise the effect of RPS needs further investigation.Findings in the central visual targets in glaucoma may change its concept as an eye disease into a whole visual pathway neurodegenerative condition and may affect our clinical practice in the future.

The cuneus isa small lobe in the occipital lobe that receives visual information from contralateral superior retina and projects fibers to the extrastriate cortex.AGMV increase in the cuneus may represent a compensation or replasticity of the visual cortex following early visual field loss in glaucoma.Cortical replasticity and cross-model plasticity have been widely observed in the brain of glaucoma patients.3o,33,34 Consistent with our present results,Williams et al.33 previously reported that patients with glaucoma may have volumetric gains in some structures early in disease,but that brain volumes decrease toward and in some cases below control volumes as the disease progresses.Li et al.3o reported significantly decreased GMV in the lingual gyrus,calcarine gyrus,postcentral gyrus,superior frontal gyrus,inferior frontal gyrus,and rolandic operculum of both sides,the right inferior occipital gyrus,left paracentral lobule,right supramarginal gyrus,and right cuneus in POAG patients.Increased GMV was detected in bilateral middle temporal gyrus,inferior parietal gyrus,angular gyrus,and left superior parietal gyrus,left precuneus,and the left middle occipital gyrus in these patients.3o In another study,GM density reduction was located bilaterally in the primary visual cortex (BA17 and BA18) and paracentral lobule (BA5),right precentral gyrus (BA6),right middle frontal gyrus (BA9),right inferior temporal gyrus (BA2O),right angular gyrus (BA39),left praecuneus (BA7),left middle temporal gyrus (BA21)，and superior temporal gyrus(BA22)while increased GM density was foundin BA39.Altered integrityofWM tracts andbrain atrophy was detected in both visual cortex and other distant nonvisual regions.34 Differences between studies could be due to heterogeneity of patient groups or the different image processing and averaging techniques employed. The data are, however, consistent with the occurrence of cortical replasticity in the brain of patients affected by glaucoma,a phenomenon that merits further investigation. ",

Despite the preserved central visual field in the stimulated region and normal GMV in bilateral occipital poles,patients with advanced POAG showed significantly compromised CBF changes in the occipital poles in response to central visual stimulation.This result is consistent with our previous publication of decreased vasoreactivity in bilateral PCAs to a reversing checkerboard stimulation presented to the central preserved “normal” visual field in patients with POAG.19 In an earlier functional MRI study,a $5 ^ { \\circ }$ hemifield reversing checkerboard was presented monocularly to the central apparently “normal”visual field of patients with asymmetric POAG.A significant decrease in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD）signal changes was observed in the occipital poles when evoked by the glaucomatous eyes as compared to the contralateral,less affected fellow eye.1o These and current findings suggest that disruption in cerebral vascular responses or cerebral blood perfusion may precede cortical structural changes,as well as detectable visual field defects in POAG. There may be a functional decrease in visual processing even in the visual field we defined as the“normal’central area in POAG.It has been reported that $2 5 \\%$ to $3 5 \\%$ ofRGCs are lost prior to detectable abnormality in automated visual field testing.48 A flow-on effect of early perceptual loss may be involved in thevisual evoked cerebrovascular or CBF perfusion insufficiency in glaucoma.A mechanism involving neurovascular coupling cannot be excluded,as cortical neurons in the occipital poles of advanced POAG patients may be functionally inhibited or impaired.Decreased neuronal activity in this region may disrupt the regulation of local arterioles and result in impaired visual evoked cerebrovascular responses.Future studies should examine the value of using CBF as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prediction of brain alterations in glaucoma.

This finding partly supports neurovascular coupling as a mechanism of brain involvement in glaucoma．More importantly, the occipital poles of advanced POAG patients that showed GMV and resting CBF perfusion comparable with that of earlymoderate glaucoma patients and controls,demonstrated significantly decreased CBF response to monocular visual stimulation presented to the central apparently“unaffected\" visual field. This raises the possibility of using CBF as an index for the evaluation of central visual function or for detection of brain changes in patients with glaucoma. Glaucoma provides a model for the study of“neurovascular coupling mechanism” in CNSneurodegenerative diseases.Whether patientswithPOAG may benefit from neuroprotective therapies directed at the entire visual pathway or at improving the regulation of cerebral vasoreactivity in addition to conventional strategies for lowering intraocular pressure is speculative.
