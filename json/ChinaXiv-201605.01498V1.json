        "text": "The use of pectin for colon-specific drug delivery has been extensively investigated; however, when used alone,pectin is often compromised due to its high solubility.This study explored the feasibility of using an in situ compression-coated crosslinking system,composed of pectin and calcium chloride,for colon-specific drug delivery.A pectin/calcium chloride (P/Ca) coating was compressed onto a core tablet.The colon specificity of the compression-coated tablet was verified by dissolution，pharmacokinetics and scintigraphy with ${ } ^ { 9 9 \\mathrm { m } } \\mathsf { T c }$ labeling.The in situ pectin and calcium chloride gel slowed the release of indomethacin.The lag time varied between $3 h$ and 7h depending on the amount of calcium chloride and the coating weight. Pectinase triggered the release of indomethacin from the compression-coated tablet,which was then accelerated by the calcium chloride in the coating layer.The compression-coated tablet had a prolonged $t _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ and apparent $t _ { 1 / 2 } ,$ as well as a decreased $C _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ and $A U C _ { 0 - \\mathrm { t } } ,$ compared with the core tablet counterpart.Evaluation with $\\gamma$ -scintigraphy verified colonspecific delivery of the compression-coated tablet. In conclusion,the $\\mathsf { P } / \\mathsf { C } \\mathsf { a }$ in situ crosslinking system worked well for colon-specific drug delivery. ",

        "text": "Colon-specific drug delivery systems (CSDDS） have been extensively investigated for use in the treatment of localized colon diseases.Among the different approaches that have been developed for the purpose of drug administration to the colon,polysaccharide-based CSDDShavedemonstrated better colon-specificity when compared with either pH- or time-dependent delivery systems，likely due to selective degradation by colonic microflora (Basit et al.,2Oo9；Shah et al.,2O11).Polysaccharides that have been well established for use in colon-specific drug delivery include pectin,guar gum,chitosan,amylose,inulin,dextran and alginate (Liu et al.,2OO7;Prabaharan,2011;Shah et al.,2011;Gulbake & Jain,2O12).Polysaccharide-based matrix and coated systems based on polysaccharide have been developed for colonspecific delivery of a variety of active ingredients (Basit, 2005；Prabaharan，2O11).Compression-coated systems have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their versatility and ability to deliver a wide range of drugs;however, preparation of these systems requires a special compression machine and highly skilled personnel (Shah et al., 2011).

        "text": "Pectin is one of the most extensively studied natural polysaccharides due to its suitability for colon-specific drug delivery (Liu et al.,2007；Sriamornsak,2011；Wong et al.，2011；Mamani Crispin et al.，2012)． However, pectin's colon-specificity is compromised by its high solubility.A previous study in which pectin alone was used as the compression coating layer required a minimum of $7 0 0 \\mathrm { { m g } }$ ofpectin to achieve reliable colon-specificity (Ashford et al.，1993).Therefore，methods that reduce pectin solubility and/or strengthen the pectin gel are often used to take full advantage of the selective degradation of pectin in the colon.Insoluble salt like calcium pectinate has been reported to provide a better shielding effect, via the formation of an‘‘egg-box\"’ configuration, leading to a more controlled drugrelease(Rubinstein et al.,1993;Hiorth et al., 2006;Jain et al.,2OO7). However,poor compressibility and difficulties with quality control,particularly with respect to the amount of calcium in the formulation,has impeded the use of calcium pectinate. Strongerpolymers, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,havebeen employed to strengthen pectin gels (Ugurlu et al.,2OO7;Hodges et al., 2009)；however，the presence of these polymers often compromises the sensitivity of the compression coat to colonic microflora.

        "text": "In previous study,we reported that fortification of pectin gels could be achieved via calcium cation-induced in situ crosslinking（Wei et al.,2006,2009；Wu et al.,2007a;Wu et al.,2Oo8).Consequently, significant slowing of the initial drug release and a sigmoid release pattern were observed with use of these pectin/calcium chloride (P/Ca) matrix systems. However,pre-colonic release is unavoidable when using these systems since drugs are dispersed in the matrix and will be released as the matrix erodes.Nevertheless,the insitu crosslinking P/Ca system might be suitable for use as a compression coating material in colon-specific drug delivery. In the previous study,complete erosion of a 75/75 $\\mathrm { ( m g / m g ) }$ （204号 P/Ca matrix occurred in $\\boldsymbol { 4 \\mathrm { h } }$ (Wei et al.,2006). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a P/Ca compression-coated tablet, with a heavier coating and the proper P/Ca ratio,may prevent premature release of a drug.In addition,adjusting the degree of gelation in the in situ crosslinking pectin system can be done by simply altering the amount of calcium salt and is much easierthan in calcium pectinate-based systems. Furthermore,calcium ions can activate or stimulate pectinase activity(Miller& Macmilla,197O).Asa result,the calcium in situ crosslinking not only slows the release of drug but the calcium chloride may also enhance the susceptibility of pectin to pectinase,thus achieving quick release at the proximal colon.

The effect of P/Ca ratioon indomethacin release is shown in Figure 1.The release pattern，which is initially slow and later accelerates,was observed in all preparations.Pectin alone had some retardant effect on indomethacin release with a lag time of about $\\boldsymbol { 4 \\mathrm { h } }$ and a release of approximately $9 0 \\%$ at $1 2 \\mathrm { h }$ .The release lag time was longer as the amount of calcium chloride in the pectin matrix increased,with the longest release lag time reaching approximately $6 \\mathrm { h }$ ，Interestingly，there was little difference in the release lag times of preparationswith different P/Ca ratios.However,the overall releaserate obviously decreased as the amount of calcium in the coating layer increased. The time it takes for $5 0 \\%$ of the drug to be released $( T _ { 5 0 } )$ for compression-coated tablets with P/Ca ratios of 200/0,200/50,200/100 and $2 0 0 / 2 0 0$ was 7.7, 9.0, 9.4 and $1 0 . 6 \\mathrm { h }$ ,respectively. Coating weight,at a fixed P/Ca ratio of 1/1,also had significant effects on release patterns (Figure 2). The lag time was prolonged,and the release rate was decreased as coating weight gain increased. The lag time was prolonged from $3 . 0 \\mathrm { h }$ to $7 . 0 \\mathrm { h }$ ,and the $T _ { 5 0 }$ increased from $5 . 2 \\mathrm { h }$ to $1 1 . 6 \\mathrm { h }$ when the P/Ca coating weight increased from 100/100 to 250/250 $\\mathrm { ( m g / m g ) }$ ： ",

A lag time over $^ { 3 \\mathrm { h } }$ can easily be attained using the compression-coated system,whereas a matrix system that is composed of the same amounts of pectin and calcium chloride cannot achieve this lag time due to the matrix erosion (Wei et al.,2O06). The lag time appeared to be related to gel thickness rather than calcium chloride content,since similar lag times were observed for tablets with different ratios of calcium chloride in the coating layer (Figure 1). Consequently， simply adjusting the coating weight can prolong the lag time. ",

This increased release Was mainly ascribed to the enzymolysis of pectinase to the pectin in the coating layer. Although it was thought that tablets with higher coating weights would have a longer degradation time, the increased amount of calcium in the coating layer increased the activity of pectinase and accelerated the degradation of pectin.

Plasma indomethacin could not be detected until $3 0 \\mathrm { h }$ .The main pharmacokinetic parameters for these two preparations are shown in Table 2.The lag time varied from $1 . 8 \\mathrm { h }$ to $5 . 8 \\mathrm { h }$ with an average value of $3 . 5 2 \\pm 1 . 7 3 \\mathrm { h }$ and was mainly attributed to individual differences among dogs.Nevertheless,the value was coincident with the average time it takes to reach the colon，which has been estimated by colon-specific delivery capsules to be $3 . 3 \\mathrm { h }$ (Niwa et al.,1995; Takaya et al.,1995). The quick disintegration of the core tablet in the stomach and subsequent dissolution resulted in a comparatively higher concentration of indomethacin in upper gastrointestinal tract. Since indomethacin can be absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract,a high $C _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ of $5 1 3 7 . 2 \\pm 6 1 4 . 0 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and a quick $t _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ of $1 . 4 \\pm 0 . 4 \\mathrm { h }$ were observed for the core tablet. However, for the compression-coated tablet,although the gel layer of pectin and calcium can be degraded by pectinase in the colon contents,the tablet remained integrated and the incorporated indomethacin was released slowly，and the release was sustained throughout the diffusion and erosion of the coating layer. The compression-coated tablet had a slow absorption phase with a $t _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ of $5 . 4 \\pm 1 . 8 \\mathrm { h }$ and a prolonged apparent $t _ { 1 / 2 }$ of $6 . 7 9 \\pm 2 . 1 4 \\mathrm { h }$ .Furthermore,since metabolism was concurrent with the absorption,the slow absorption of indomethacin from the compression-coated tablet led to a low $C _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ of $1 0 9 9 . 6 \\pm 3 0 9 . 3 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ 、The compression-coated tablet ultimately had an $A U C _ { \\mathrm { 0 - t } }$ of $5 6 1 5 . 6 \\pm 1 3 0 2 . 7 \\mathrm { n g h / m L }$ ，which was lower than the $A U C _ { \\mathrm { 0 - t } }$ of $8 0 9 1 . 1 \\pm 3 8 8 9 . 1 \\mathrm { n g } \\mathrm { h / m L }$ associatedwith thecore tablet.
