However,practical applications of the superhydrophobic surfaces are usually restricted by their poor mechanical stability.In nature,plants retain their superhydrophobicity by reconstructing their surfaces with micro-/nanohybrid structuresand releasing wax-like materials after destroyed [11-13].Yet it isalmost impossible for the superhydrophobic surfaces made artificially to follow nature's way when destroyed.

The superhydrophobic coatings can be constructed on a wide variety of substrate materials,metals,ceramics,or polymers, et al.(Fig. 4b-1).The inorganic matrix coatings with microporous topographical structures and micron-sized cone geometry are made by thermal spray approach (Fig.4b-2).Further modification by suspension thermal sprayed PTFE/nano-Cu facilitates accomplishment of superhydrophobicity of the coatings(Fig.4b-3). Obviously,sizes,spacing and shapes of the structures affect predominately wettability of the surfaces.The cone geometry in the size of tens of microns essentially performs the function as rough hydrophobic skeleton and supplies mechanical strength.Further decoration by PTFE/nano-Cu as the thin top layer provides nanostructures and low energy materials.It was realized that cone-like structure in nanoscale featuresalso produces superhydrophobicity[3O],even though if the superhydrophobic surfaces can hold up against surface damage is still a challenging question. It has been reported that conical surface textures exhibita spontaneous,partial reappearance of trapped gas phase upon liquid depressurization, yet the superhydrophobic state of the nanostructured conical textures vanishes above critical pressures which depend on texture shape and size [31].The mechanism as to how nanostructured geometry offers superhydrophobicityis believed to be attributed to partially trapped air inside the nanostructures,which in turn gives rise to incomplete liquid penetration [32]. Our technique route equips the inorganic matrix coatings with tunable surface textures in micron-sized scale and additional hydrophobic surface chemistry.The low energy PTFE layer with nanostructures inhibits possible infiltration of water droplets,facilitatinga longtermhydrophobicity.Itis noted,however,that the wettability of the constructed surfaces depends to a large extent on the spacing between adjacent cones (Table 1),which needs to be further elucidated.The most exciting advantage of the approach proposed in this research is the wide selection of substrate materials and inorganic coating materials,simplicity in fabrication and efficiency in cost.

With increase in abrasion length,CA of the normal titania coating covered by the PTFE/nano-Cu top layer drops markedly,showing a value of ${ \\sim } 1 3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ as the abrasion length is $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m }$ ï¼ŒSurprisingly,all the surfaces constructed on the patterned titania coatings retain the superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of ${ \\sim } 1 5 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . SA values of all the surfaces obviously increase with the increase in abrasion length (Fig.5a-2). Compared with CA,SA valuesare more sensitive to the abrasion.When the abrasion length is increased to $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m }$ ,SA of the normal titania coating increases significantly from ${ \\sim } 3 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ to ${ \\sim } 1 2 ^ { \\circ }$ .While SA values of all the surfaces constructed on the patterned titania coatings are lower than $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ as the abrasion length is $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m }$ It is noted that the micropatterned topographical features are remained well after the abrasion (Fig.5b-1,b-2), predominately due to the fact that as typical ceramic material, titaniaoffersremarkable capabilityof resistingwear.Afterlong time abrasion,only the sharp top end parts of the cones are worn off, majority of the cone geometry is retained. Consequently,most of the micro-/nano-scaled topographical morphologies and the surface chemistryare largely protected.The nanoscaled structure and surface chemistry of the low surface energy hydrophobic layer can befurther preserved by the microporous structure and microscaled titania in between the protrusions(see the enlarged surface view shown as inset in Fig.5b-1). It is therefore anticipated that as far asthe patterned structural features are still there,the superhydrophobicity of the surfaces persists.It is therefore clear that the durability of the superhydrophobicity of the constructed surfaces in harsh wear service environmentis mainly decided by mechanical strength of the matrix coating materials (titania in this case). Furthermore,it is interesting to note that the surfaces constructed on the titania coating with the inter-distance between adjacent cones of ${ \\sim } 2 2 7 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ show the best hydrophobic performances after severe abrasion(Fig.5a).This indicates the remarkable influence of the pattern size on wettability,which has also been realized by other researchers [33-36].
