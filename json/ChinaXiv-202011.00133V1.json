Snow is an important source of water for seed germination in the temperate deserts of Central Asia. Understanding how seed germination responds to variations in snow cover in relation to seed traits and plant ecological characteristics can help predict plant community sustainability and stability in Central Asia under a scenario climate change. This study investigated the seed germination of 35 plant species common to the Gurbantunggut Desert in Central Asia under the three snow treatments: (1) snow addition; (2) ambient snow; and (3) snow removal. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were performed to assess interactions among the impacts of snow treatments, seed traits and plant ecological characteristics on seed germination. Phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS) model was used to test the relationships between seed traits and seed germination. The results demonstrated that snow variations had no significant impacts on seed germination overall. Seed germination under the snow addition treatment was similar with that under the ambient snow treatment,irrespective of seed traits and plant ecological characteristics. Snow removal only had negative impacts on seed germination for certain groups of seed traits and plant ecological characteristics. Seed mass positively affected seed germination, showing a linear increase of arcsin square root-transformed seed germination with log-transformed seed mass. Seed shape also profoundly impacted seed germination, with a higher germination percentage for elongated and flat seeds. Seed germination differed under different plant life forms, with semi-shrub species showing a significantly higher germination percentage. Most importantly,although snow treatments,seed traits and plant ecological characteristics had no interactive effects on seed germination overall,some negative impacts from the snow removal treatment were detected when seeds were categorized on the basis of seed massand shape. This result suggests that variations of snow cover may change plant community composition in this temperate desert due to their impacts on seed germination. ",

        "text": "Year-round or seasonal snow cover shows inter-annual variation at high and middle latitudes and at high altitudes,and the degree of inter-annual variation is increasing, especially under climate change. This change in inter-annual snowfall variation generally leads to changes in soil physical variables, including temperature and water availability， thus affecting the evolution of local ecosystems (Houle, 2002； Decker et al.， 2003; Keller et al.， 2005). For example, snowfall significantly changes nitrogen uptake by vegetation (Bilbrough， 2OOO)， photosynthesis and respiration rates (Li et al., 2006a), biomass accumulation (Dorrepaal et al., 2004) and biomass allocation (Kreyling et al., 2O12; Chen et al., 2013). Earlier germination and completion of the life cycle of spring ephemerals under increasing snow enhance their competitive advantage in a plant community in North America (Houle, 2OO2). Early spring ephemerals in Central Asia have adapted to arid deserts by evolving a short-term growth rhythm and specific biological traits (Lapointe et al., 2OO6; Constable et al., 2OO7). Therefore, changes in snowfal may afect seed germination and seedling survival of plant species in this region (Chao and Sun, 2O16; Jia et al., 2017). Similarly, the responses of seed germination to snow vary according to plant functional group in the Great Lakes region of North America (Drescher and Thomas, 2013). ",

        "text": "Seed germination is a critical stage of the plant life cycle and determines subsequent plant performance and survival, ultimately affecting plant community composition. Seed germination has been associated with various seed biological traits, including seed size, mass and shape. In addition, plant ecological characteristics have been recognized as a key factor influencing seed germination. Seed size is an important ecological feature of plant life history, which can affect the life history characteristics of plant seedling survival, seed spread and seed numbers (Westoby et al., 1992; Frenner, 20o0). Lorenzi et al. (2002) studied 169 tree species in a tropical rainforest of Brazil and found a significant positive correlation between seed size and average germination time. Studies of 558 plant species in the alpine region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and 69 species of mesophytes in the Hexi Corridor of China showed that seed size was an important determinant of plant life history characteristics (Liu et al.,2003, 2004; Li et al.,2006b; Bu et al., 2008; Wang, 2009). The relationship between seed size and seed germination remains contentious, with some studies showing a significant negative correlation and others showing no significant relationship (Liu et al., 2007).

        "text": "Seed mass is one of the most important seed biological traits and contributes to different levels of seed germination as the amounts of starch and endosperm nutrients contained in a seed may determine the energy and nutrients available for seed germination (Chen et al., 2OO2; Soriano et al., 2011). Studies have shown that seed mass may affect seed germination (Reich,1994; Paz et al., 1999; Bu et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2014). Direct positive experimental evidences of the impacts of seed mass on seed germination remain scarce, and mostly relate to positive impacts on seed germination (Catoni et al.， 2015； Wang et al.， 2016) and seedling survival (Wang, 2009). However, indirect evidence has shown that seed size is positively related to seed germination (Bu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 20O9). Whether seed mass is also positively related to seed germination remains unclear. Seed shape is another important trait that influences seed germination (Weiher et al.,1999; Tekrony et al., 2OO5). Although theoretical studies have predicted that elongated and flat seeds should exhibit a higher germination percentage (GP) compared to round seeds (Gremer et al.,2O14), experimental evidence is needed to understand the role of seed shape in seed germination (Liu et al., 2014).

Increased precipitation has been shown to significantly increase (Zheng et al., 2005; Arfin-Khan et al., 2018), decrease (Zhao et al.， 2012) or have no impact on (Weltzin and Mcpherson, 20o0) seedling emergence percentage (i.e.， GP). Snow is an important source of water for seed germination and seedling survival in most parts of the temperate deserts in Central Asia. Snow melt provides the moisture necessary for seed germination and plant growth during early spring (Gutterman, 2000; Sun et al., 2009; Yuan and Tang,2010; Fan et al.,2013). Previous studies have shown that variations in snow cover have profound impacts on herbaceous plant community composition at the peak of plant growth. While studies on invasive and indigenous plants have shown that an increase or decrease in snow cover has no significant impact on seed germination, but an increase in snow cover is beneficial to the establishment of indigenous plant populations (Gornish et al., 2015).

For example, the number of snowfall days has been shown to affect the wintering safety of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica seedlings (Yan et al., 2012).Decreased snow may result in the loss of the snow-cover temperature barrier, thereby decreasing the probability of survival over winter for many plant species (Simons et al., 2010). Snow cover is essential to seed germination because of its direct impacts on water availability and indirect impacts on soil temperature and nutrient availability. For instance, the replenishment of soil moisture during early spring in a desert ecosystem could increase soil water content (SWC) (Fan et al.， 2O12). Changes in soil physical properties may have different impacts on seed germination in terms of plant ecotype and seed traits， thus changing plant community composition and succession (Drescher and Thomas, 2013).

The 35 plant species show a wide range of variation in terms of seed mass, shape and color, and also have different plant ecological traits. A previous study conducted $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { k m }$ away from the study site of the present study demonstrated that a $50 \\%$ increase in snow cover profoundly decreased spring ephemeral density in one year out of three consecutive years studied, whereas a $100 \\%$ increase in snow cover exerted no impacts on spring ephemeral density (Fan et al., 2O14). The seeds of spring ephemerals are characterized by a small size and a low mass; therefore, they may require less water to promote germination compared with large seeds. The change of snow cover has a profound effect on the composition of the herbaceous plant community during the period of vigorous growth. Seed germination is one of the important factors that affect the composition of plant communities. Therefore, under a scenario of climate change, studying how snow cover affects seed germination is helpful to understand the composition and stability of desert plant communities in the temperate deserts of Central Asia.

This temperate desert exhibits an annual precipitation varying from 70 to $1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ , with most precipitation occurring during spring. There is snow cover from early November to late March, ranging from 10 to $5 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ in thickness, with a mean annual of $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ ， The mean annual potential evaporation is $2 6 0 6 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ .The annual mean temperature is $7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ， with the minimum of $- 4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and a mean of $- 1 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ in January. Plant community in the desert is composed of semi-shrubs, spring ephemerals, spring-summer annuals and perennial herbs (Huang et al.， 2O15). Semi-shrubs in the region, such as Haloxylon ammodendron, Haloxylon persicum and Tamarix ramosissima, depend primarily on groundwater to survive. Although these plants fall their leaves in October, their above-ground woody parts persist through the winter. Spring ephemerals, such as Erodium oxyrrhynchum, Alyssum linifolium, Schismus arabicus and Lactuca undulate, generally depend on snowmelt water and spring precipitation for growth (Fan et al., 2014; Huang and Li, 2O15). In contrast, spring-summer annuals and perennial herbs, such as Salsola subcrassa, Ceratocarpus arenarius, Seriphidium santolinum and Agriophyllum squarrosum, depend on summer precipitation as their main source of water (Huang et al., 2O15). Spring-summer annuals often show low growth rates during the growing season of ephemerals, with their growth rates accelerating after ephemerals die (Huang et al., 2018). A new non-woody shoot emerges from perennial herbs every April that persists until the onset of autumn (i.e., October). Soils of the region are desert solonetz, with aeolian sandy soil on the top layer $( 0 { - } 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } )$ . Up to 2O6 plant species are found in this desert (Zhang and Chen, 2002),and plant community composition changes noticeably from the edge to the center of the desert due to varying soil moisture and soil texture.

After each snowfall event, we increased or decreased the snow cover of each treatment according to the extent of the last snowfall event. For the snow removal plots， snow was removed from the transparent polycarbonate coverings on each plot after each snowfall event. Ambient snow plots were left to receive natural snowfall. The snow removed from the snow removal plots was evenly sprinkled to the snow addition plots. Shade netting was wrapped around the frame since mid-October to prevent wind-blown snow from entering the plots, and was removed after snowmelt in late March. In addition, the plants in the plots were relatively uniformly distributed. ",

For instance, although snow removal decreased seed germination of both native Pseudoroegnaria spicata and invasive Bromus tectorum grass species in a cold desert in North America, snow addition had no associated impacts (Gornish et al., 2O15). Consistent with these studies, the present study exhibited no impacts of snow addition on seed germination for the 35 plant species examined, and snow removal impacts on seed germination were only observed for plants with certain seed traits or plant life forms.

Moreover, SWC at the depth of $2 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ showed no differences from snow melting to the time of seed germination. These results suggest that the similar seed germination observed between the ambient snow and snow addition treatments may be due to there being no significant differences in soil temperature and moisture between the two snow treatments. Snow removal treatment dramatically decreased the soil surface temperature and reduced the frequency of the soil freze-thaw cycles. Moreover, since SWC at snow melt was significantly lower than that ambient snow, the similarity in seed germination between the ambient snow and snow removal treatments may be due to the sufficient spring precipitation experienced during the study period.

        "text": "Several studies have indicated that seed germination is correlated with seed traits such as seed shape and mass (Wang et al., 2O16). The results of the present study clearly showed that seed traits such as seed mass and shape significantly affected seed germination. In the present study, seed mass positively affected seed germination, which is consistent with the results of many previous studies, which showed that large and heavy seeds have a higher percentage of germination because of their larger reserves of energy and nutrients (van Molken et al., 2005; Wu and Du, 2007； Galindez et al.， 2O09). However， some studies have identified negative relationships between seed mass and seed germination in some semi-arid ecosystems. There are several possible interpretations for this contradiction among studies. The different relationships between seed germination and seed mass are primarily related to the ranges of seed mass investigated among different studies (Grime et al., 1981; van Molken et al., 2O05; Galindez et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2O16). For instance, for Tragopogon pratensis species in variable habitats, a study of seed mass ranging from 0.011 to $1 3 0 . 7 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ showed a negative relationship between seed germination and seed mass (Wang et al., 2O16), while another study of seed mass ranging from 4.000 to $1 7 . 0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m g } }$ exhibited positive impacts of seed mass on seed germination (van Molken et al., 2OO5). Similarly, a higher seed germination was observed for seven Asteraceae species from Argentina with larger seeds $( \\mathrm { m a s s } { > } 0 . 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g } )$ (Galindez et al., 2009). In the present study, the mass of seeds ranged from O.076 to $1 3 . 8 9 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ ，which is comparable to that of seeds investigated by van Molken (2Oo5). In particular, the present study found that the impacts of seed mass on seed germination varied among different snow treatments. Under the snow addition treatment, seed mass had a significant influence on seed germination, with heavy seeds showing a higher seed germination compared to light seeds. This observation may be due to seedlings of heavy seeds having access to greater amounts of food reserves, thereby resulting in a considerable competitive advantage during drought conditions by allowing a delay in germination or dormancy under unfavorable environment conditions that maximizes plant fitness. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that seed germination of the 35 species investigated under a scenario of climate change in the temperate desert was largely dependent on seed mass.

        "text": "In the present study, elongated and flat seeds showed a higher GP than round seeds. Although there have been few studies relating sed germination with seed shape (Grime et al., 1981; Liu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2O16), the available results consistently showed that elongated and flat seeds exhibit a higher GP. Many previous studies have shown that seed shape is linked to plant phylogeny, indicating that elongated and flat seeds usually promote fast germination to avoid predation and risks of mortality during dispersal (Thompson et al., 1993; Thompson et al., 1998; Funes et al., 1999).

        "text": "In the Gurbantunggut Desert, plant ecological characteristics had different impacts on seed germination, with plant life form significantly affecting seed germination and plant ecotype having no impacts. The impacts of plant life form on seed germination may be related to plant habitat or flora, and the impacts vary among different studies. For instance, plant life form, including woody plants, graminoid plants and forbs, had no impacts on seed germination in 109 species in a temperate sandy desert in northeastern China (Wang et al., 2O16). Similarly, results from an alpine grassland in Tibet of China showed no differences in seed germination between annuals and perennials for 134 species (Xu et al., 2O14). In contrast, significant plant life form impacts on seed germination have been reported in grassands (Rees, 1994) and alpine meadows (Bu et al., 2008). ",

        "text": "Snow variations had no significant impacts on seed germination of the 35 plant species common to the Gurbantunggut Desert in Central Asia. The similar seed germination observed between the snow addition and ambient snow treatments suggests that slight changes in soil water content and temperature under the snow addition treatment exerted no impacts on seed germination. However, the observation of no significant impacts of the snow removal treatment on seed germination was due to the enough spring precipitation having occurred, which countered the impacts of different water availability under the different snow treatments in the present study. In general, snow treatments， seed traits and plant ecotype had no interactive effects on seed germination. Nevertheless, when comparing the relationships between seed germination and seed mass among the three snow treatments， the repression slope under the snow addition treatment was significantly higher, whereas it was significantly lower under the snow removal treatment, compared with that under the ambient snow treatment. The results suggest that snow treatment impacts on seed germination were obvious for heavy seeds in the desert ecosystem. The results of the present study indicate that under a scenario of climate change, variations in snow cover would change plant community structure by changing seed germination of heavy seeds, while the influence on seed germination of light seeds was not significant.
