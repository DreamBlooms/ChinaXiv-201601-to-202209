        "text": "Floating zone technique is a crucible-free processfor growth of high quality single crystals. Unstable thermocapillary convection is a typical phenomenon during the process under microgravity.Therefore,it is very important to investigate the instabilityof thermocapillary convection in liquid bridges with deformable free-surface under microgravity. In this works,the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to track the free-surface movement. The results are presented as the behavior of flow structure and temperature distribution of the molten zone.The impact of Marangoni number $( M a )$ is also investigated on free-surface deformation as well as the instability of thermocapillary convection.The free-surface exhibits a noticeable axisymmetric (but it is non-centrosymmetric) and eliptical shape along the circumferential direction.This specific surface shape presents a typical narrow ‚Äòneck-shaped'structure with convex at two ends of the zone and concave at the mid-plane along the axial direction. At both $\\theta = 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $\\theta = 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ,the deformation ratio $\\xi$ increases rapidly with Ma at first,and then increases slowly. Moreover, the hydrothermal wave number $m$ and the instability of thermocapillary convection increase with $M a$ ",

        "text": "The free-surface deformation was a necessary condition for the onset of oscillatory thermocapillary convection[13]. It's of great importance to investigate the freesurface deformation behavior of the liquid bridge in fabricating single crystals with high purity. To date, only a few investigations concerned the effect of free-surface deformation.Kuhlmann and Nienhuiser[14] investigated the flow-induced dynamic free-surface deformations in liquid bridges. They found that the total dynamic deformation could be decomposed to elucidate the relative importance of the hydrodynamic pressure, viscous stress, change of volume,surface tension and hydrostatic pressure.Sim et al.[15] investigated the dynamic free-surface deformations in two-dimensional (2D) liquid bridges, and their numerical results indicated that the free-surfaces were convex at the cold wall and concave at the hot wall. Shevtsova et al.[16] investigated the dynamic freesurface in non-cylindrical liquid bridges of $5 \\ : c S t$ silicone oil,and found the magnitude of deformation increased with the temperature difference of the cold and hot walls. Liang and Kawaji [17] developed a three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation to investigate the vibration-induced oscillation of liquid bridge by level set method.The results showed that the external vibration in $x$ direction at resonance frequency controlled the surface oscillation in $x$ direction while the influence of external vibrations in $y$ and $z$ directions on the surface vibration was small.Ahmed et al.[18] found the flexible freesurface capable of influencing the thermocapillary convection of small scale liquid bridges. Zhou and Huang [19] numerically studied the steady thermocapillary convection in 3D rectangular cavities using level set method. The interface was discovered to bulge out near the hot wall and bulge in near the cold wall and the deformability increased with an increasing Ma. Zhou and Huai [20] investigated the thermo-solutocapillary convection in axisymmetric liquid bridge with a dynamic free surface. The free surface bulged out at the two ends of zone and bulged in at the central zone when the thermal Marango ni number was identical to the solutal Marangoni number. ",

Consequently this paper aims to numerically investigate the thermocapillary convection in a 3D liquid bridge with considering the free-surface deformation.With a fixed aspect ratio,the effect of Ma on deformable free-surface shape is explored as well as the instability of thermocapillary convection.

(5). The normal viscous stress now promotes a bulging near both the hot and the cold corners.And this bulge is accelerated by the positive radial flow near the hot corner and suppressed by the negative radial flow near the cold corner (see Fig.5(a)). Thus,the extent of bulging out near the hot wall is much larger than near the cold wall.At the same time, due to the constant volume of the liquid bridge,the interface is constricted at the mid-plane of the liquid bridge.As a result, the free-surface presents a typical narrow‚Äòneck-shaped‚Äô structure with convex near the cold and hot walls and concave at the middle section of the liquid bridge,as shown in Fig. 3(a).For a better understanding of the characteristics, the free-surface deformation at different circumferential positions is also conducted,as shown in Fig.3(b).It is evident that the free-surfaces show a noticeable oscillation and axisymmetric,but non-centrosymmetry distribution.

And the area of narrow and sharp low temperature area in deformable free-surface case is also bigger than that in the fixed surface case.In conclusion,the free-surface deformation has a significant effect on the flow structure and temperature distribution of the liquid bridge.It is necessary to consider the effect of free-surface deformation when investigating the thermocapillary convection in the floating-zone crystal growth.
