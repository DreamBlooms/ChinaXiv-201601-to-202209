Thermal spot and thermal ratcheting appear near the concentrated void cavity easily. Stress and creep deformation will appear with the effect of the thermal-structural coupling of void cavity and high temperature heat load. Thus the usage life of high temperature phase change thermal storage canister will decrease and even destroy. The thermodynamic performance of high temperature phase change material canister and compound phase change material canister need to be deeply studied. The influence of void cavity on thermal performance of PCM canister for heat pipe receiver undermicrogravity needs to be analyzed in detail. ",

        "text": "By the above comparative analysis,it can be found that different void cavity distribution model has a great influence on simulation results for the process of phase change thermal storage.Therefore,the establishment of a reasonable void cavity model is a precondition to improve the accuracy of simulation results.In the process of simulation,a simple void cavity model is used to assume that void cavity distributes in a uniform annular region close to the outer wall of thermal storage container, which simplifies the determination of void cavity region and mesh generation of geometric model, but this kind of void cavity distribution model is too simple,and will affect the accuracy of simulation results.The assumption of ignoring void cavity simplifies the calculation process greatly,but which is obviously inconsistent with the actual situation and makes the simulation results have great difference with the actual process of phase change thermal storage. The improved void cavity model is established on the basis of the theoretical analysis.The improved model tending to high temperature region is based on the actual solidification process.The model of improved void cavity distribution is more reasonable and reliable than that of ignoring void cavity and simple void cavity distribution. According to the main characteristics of phase change thermal storage during the above process. the improvement for the designing of PCM canister is necessary. The concentrated distribution of void cavity not only reduces thermal performance of PCM canister due to local heat resistance,but also generates thermal stress and influences structural reliability of thermal storage container due to large temperature gradient. Therefore, the main goal of the improved designing for thermal storage container is to take measures in reducing the concentration distribution of void cavity by adding some foam metal into phase change material. In addition, heat transfer in the container can be effectively enhanced by side wall,which needs to be fully considered in the structural designing of thermal storage container. ",

Since the temperature of PCM close to canister inner wall decreases more quicklythan that ofPCM closeto canister outer wall,PCM close to canister inner wall freezes earlier.PCM in canister freezes gradually along the radial from inner wall to outer wall. Most of void cavities appearnear the outer wall in canister. ",
