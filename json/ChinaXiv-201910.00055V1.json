        "text": "Abstract: Water resources are critical for the existence and development of oases in endorheic basins. Thus, to enable sustainable development, it is fundamentally important to understand how to allocate and use these resources in a reasonable way. We therefore simulated and analyzed changes in water consumption pattern within the Dunhuang Oasis of China under three scenarios using a system dynamic model that corresponds to different water consumption pattern.This was done to assessthe impacts of regional water resource planning (comprehensive planning of the rational use of water resource and protection of ecosystem services in the Dunhuang Basin) on water consumption pattern within the Dunhuang Oasis. The first of these,Scenario 1,is a baseline in which the status quo is maintained, while Scenario 2 incorporates the comprehensive effects of agricultural water-saving irrigation measures with an inter-basin water diversion project,and Scenario 3 focuses on ecological rehabilitation.In the baseline Scenario 1,the total water consumption within the Dunhuang Oasis increased progresively while agricultural water consumption remained extremely high and threatened overall ecological security. In contrast, Scenario 2 would decrease agricultural water consumption by almost $5 . 3 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 7 } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ following the implementation of water-saving practices. The additional water allocated from an inter-basin water diversion project would play an important role in alleviating ecological strain on the oasis.Finaly,in Scenario 3,the total irrigated land must be decreased to $2 0 . 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ by 2025 assuming that water supply for ecosystem restoration would be at least $50 \\%$ of the total consumption. Although water resource planning plays a very important role in alleviating the ecological water crisis within the oasis,it is necessary to consider the suitable scale of oasis with regard to current water consumption pattern.

An oasis is defined as a specific landscape that exists within deserts in arid and semi-arid regions and that enables flourishing vegetation and human settlement because of a stable water supply (Ling et al., 2O13). Without water, an oasis cannot survive and will become desertified; this coupled relationship between an oasis and water is determined by basic water resource patterns. For a catchment in arid region, the upper reaches is the water production area with snow and glacier melting from mountains; and the middle and lower reaches are the water consumption area with scarce precipitation. Enhanced water consumption in the upper and middle reaches caused by the booming population and rapid economic development results in more serious ecological problems in the corresponding lower reaches (Cheng et al.,2014). These efects include the desiccation of terminal lakes, increased sandstorms and the death of Populus euphratica forests leading to a series of severe ecological disasters (Department of Geoscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences,1996). The world heritage sites of Mogao Grottoes, Mingsha Mountain (sounding dunes), and Crescent Spring all are located within the Dunhuang Oasis of China (Zhang et al., 2O14). The water resource crisis in this region is therefore a threat to this natural oasis as well as the precious cultural heritage. ",

Therefore,the main problem is the competition in water demands between the developments of socio-economy and sustainable ecosystem within inland river basins (Micklin, 1988; Feng et al., 2O01). A huge range of water resource planning strategies have therefore been implemented to address this issue within inland river basins around the world,including the Tarim River Basin (Sun et al.,2011), Heihe River Basin (Cheng et al., 2014; Hu et al.,2015a), and Shiyang River Basin in China (Zhu and Li, 2014), the Murray-Darling River Basin (MDB) in Australia (Wheeler et al., 2O14) and the Guadalquivir River Basin in Spain (Berbel et al., 2015).

The MDB Plan was finally signed into law in December 2012 (Zhao et al., 2015) and has since had a marked effect on recovering ecosystem functions and balancing the multiple needs within this basin (Bark et al., 2O13). The most advanced water resource planning strategy currently in place in Europe is the case of the Guadalquivir River in Spain; this waterway is the largest river in southern Spain and crosses $2 5 \\%$ of the nation's irrigated area.The Guadalquivir River Basin has reached its extraction limit, however, and has no additional water sources available in this region.A consequent reduction in water use is therefore planned across this basin, including water-saving measures to be applied in both agricultural and urban sectors. This plan represents a useful strategy to achieve sustainable water management because it details economic and technical measures to control demand while fulfilling wastewater treatment objectives including non-point source pollution from agriculture as well as urban point source pollution (Gutierrez-Martin et al.,2017). The first successful water resource planning case within China has been the Heihe River Basin Plan (Cheng et al., 2014). The Heihe River Basin is the second largest inland river basin within the northwestern China. Excessive water consumption due to agriculture production has impacted artificial oases in the middle reaches,and the Ejin Oasis in the lower reaches has experienced increasingly serious ecological problems. An ecological water diversion project was therefore implemented at the end of the $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century and severe ecosystem deterioration in the lower reaches has been dramatically mitigated (Cheng et al., 2O14). The middle reaches of this basin are required to transfer $9 . 5 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ of water to the lower reaches in \"normal\" years (defined as a year in which the upper reaches of the basin discharge $1 5 . 8 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ of water) (Hu et al.,2015b). This increased water volume is then allowed to flow into the lower reaches of the basin restoring lakes and supporting the recovery of vegetation within the Ejin Oasis (Hu et al., 2015a). ",

The Danghe River has a total volume of $4 . 6 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ and is the largest watercourse within the Dunhuang Oasis. The water resource exploitation and utilization rates are close to $100 \\%$ in the oasis and the agricultural water consumption accounts for nearly $90 \\%$ （204号 of total resource available.Ecological water use over recent decades has been impacted by the rapid development of the local economy. This has led to an ecological crisis mainly manifest in a shrunken terminal lake,a decline in the groundwater level and accelerated desertification. Water has become both the primary restrictive factor and bottleneck for socioeconomic development within the Dunhuang Oasis. Thus, in order to protect precious local heritage and improve the ecological environment, Dunhuang City has proposed a program of \"Comprehensive Planning of the Rational Use of Water Resource and Protection of Ecosystem Services in the Dunhuang Basin\" (DBP) (Water Resource Department of Gansu Province, 2011). Programs proposed within the DBP include agricultural water-saving measures, patterns of crop and industrial structural adjustments, as well as a water transfer project from the Sugan Lake Basin to the Danghe River Basin. The 2020 goals of the DBP are to: (1) maintain groundwater in an equilibrium state; (2) raise the water level of Crescent Lake to $2 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ to recover its original shape;(3） stop the expansion of desertification within the basin and grassland degeneration around the oasis fringes; and (4) maintain the West Lake Nature Reserve in a stable state. Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 in this study are based on the DBP. We also extended the simulation period assessed here from 2020 to 2025 to encompass the extra time necessary to implement this plan. ",

The SD model can also be used to predict changes in complex systems under \"what-if\" scenarios and can therefore be very useful for examining and recommending policy decisions in management and social contexts (Mohapatra et al., 1994). The SD methodology has been applied across numerous research fields including urban and ecoenvironmental planning as wellas for the evaluation of land carrying capacity (Higgins et al.,1997; Gertseva et al.,20o4; Huang et al.,2009).

This means that a volume of $0 . 4 1 5 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ must be removed from surface water to recharge the ecological system in the lower reaches, which would result in an ultimate usable surface water supply of $2 . 6 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ . The data presented in Table 8summarize our SD simulation results.It is clear that total water consumption will increase from $3 . 4 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ in 2010 to $3 . 5 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ in 2025.These results suggest that if this oasis is to be maintained at its current developmental state,high groundwater exploitation intensity is essential even though the problem of groundwater depletion has already become increasingly serious. The world-famous natural landscape of the Crescent Spring, for example, has experienced a water level decline of $9 { - } 1 1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ over the last 40 years such that part of the lake bottom is now exposed during the low-water season (Zhou et al.,2Oo7). We conclude that Scenario 1 is therefore inconsistent with sustainable development. ",

        "text": "We analyzed WCP within the Dunhuang Oasis under three scenarios using a system dynamics model.The results of this study reveal that agriculture is the primary consumer of water within the Dunhuang Oasis $( > 9 0 \\% )$ while domestic,industrial and service industrial water consumption all together play a small role in Dunhuang Oasis WCP.As the total water consumption of these three accounted for $6 . 7 \\%$ ， $7 . 4 \\%$ ， $8 . 5 \\%$ and $9 . 7 \\%$ in 2010,2015,2020 and 2025,respectively, limited savings are likely to be found from these sections. Data show that under Scenario 1, the presentday baseline, total water consumption within the Dunhuang Oasis is likely to progressvely increase as agricultural uses remain quite high. Depletion at this level wil lead to worsening groundwater losses and will threaten the ecological security of the oasis. Modeling results suggest that implementing water-saving measures will lead to savings of almost $5 . 3 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 7 } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ . A substantial agricultural base wil lead to large total water consumption; thus, by 2O25,the proportion of water consumed by agriculture will decrease by only $2 . 7 \\%$ from $8 9 . 0 \\%$ under Scenario 1 to $8 6 . 3 \\%$ under Scenario 2. The implementation of water-saving measures cannot be ignored; agricultural water saved in this way can be re-assigned to the domestic and industrial subsystems and can also contribute to mitigating groundwater depletion. The additional water supply available from the inter-basin diversion project will increase ecological water demand from $2 . 5 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ to $1 0 . 9 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 7 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ （20 while the water supply in this regard will also increase significantly. Additional water allocated from the inter-basin water diversion project will also play a very important role in alleviating the oasis ecological water crisis. Thus, if regional ecological construction is regarded as the most important development strategy within the Dunhuang Oasis, total irrigated area should be decreased to $2 . 0 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ by 2025.
