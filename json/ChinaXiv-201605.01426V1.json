In contrast, ${ \\mathsf { N a } } ^ { + }$ is only essential for a number of $\\mathsf { C } _ { 4 }$ or crassulacean acid metabolism(CAM) photosynthesis species,where it functions as a micronutrient.In all other species ${ \\mathsf { N a } } ^ { + }$ does not act as a nutrient because it is not required for normal plant growth [7-9].

        "text": "According to their salinity resistance,plants can be divided into halophytesand glycophytes.Halophytes,plants that can survive to reproduce in an environment where the salt (NaCl) concentration is around $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m M }$ ormore,are further divided into recretohalophytes,euhalophytes,and pseudo-halophytes based on their physiological mechanism of salinity tolerance,morphologic structures,and ecological characteristics [1O,11].The most remarkable features of recretohalophytes are the specialized salt-secreting structures including salt glands and salt bladders that can secrete or sequestrate excess salts out of cells of the main body of the leaf. A salt gland is an excretory organ that plays a prominent role in regulating ion balance,maintaining the stability of osmotic pressure,and enhancing the salinity tolerance of plants under salinity [12].With the spread of soil salinization worldwide,it has become increasingly important to understand the salt-tolerance mechanisms of halophytes.Transmission electron microscope (TEM) provides the resolution necessary to show precise details of such glands and has contributed significantly to our understanding of theirultrastructure in recretohalophytes[13,14].In the last century,TEMcombined withX-ray microanalysis has been widely used to elucidate the ultrastructure and localize the ions in the salt gland cells[15],and three hypotheses for the secretory mechanism of salt glands have been proposed.Arisz et al.[16] argued that salt secretion was a consequence of pressure generated in the gland cells; Ziegler and Lüttge [17] and Shimony and Fahn [18] proposed that salt secretion involved exocytosis; Levering and Thomson [14] suggested that salt secretion was similar to animal transport systems, but up to now,none of these hypotheses has been verified [12]. The main experimental obstacle to elucidating the mechanism of secretion is ion movement between cytoplasmand organelles during TEM sample preparation [19].Another restriction is that X-ray microanalysis lacks the sensitivity to detect most mineral nutrients at physiological concentrations in plant tissues and needs further improvement on the collection efficiency of the X-ray detectors [20].Consequently,the function of $\\mathrm { \\cdot } \\mathrm { \\ K ^ { + } }$ in salt gland cells in determining the salt tolerance of recretohalophytesis poorly understood. Most previous work has only considered the whole tissue $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ concentration and our understanding of the importance of $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ within thesalt gland cells is limited.To evaluate this,more direct evidence is required using new methods of both sample preparation and elemental localization at the subcellular level.

        "text": "Secondary ion mass spectrometry(SIMS) microscopy is a secondary ion imaging technique that uses an energetic primary ion beam to remove particles from the uppermost few atomic layers of the biological specimen surface. The ions emitted during this bombardment known as secondary ions,are analyzed in a mass spectrometer to provide chemical information about the elemental distribution of the sample [28-3O]. Technically speaking, the NanoSIMS is a dynamic,double-focussing,magnetic-sector, multi-collection capability scanning ion microprobe [31,32].The NanoSiMS secondary ions are produced by bombardment of the sample with either $0 ^ { - }$ for electropositive ions or $C s ^ { + }$ to generate negative ions.Use of the $C s ^ { + }$ source hasan added advantage that the secondary electron(SE) image can also be detected,allowing the sample surface topography and morphology to be imaged [33,34]. NanoSIMS is characterized by three fundamental characteristics:(i) high spatial resolution down to $5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ for $C s ^ { + }$ primary ions and $1 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ for $0 ^ { - }$ primary ions,so elemental imaging is at the nanoscale;(ii) high sensitivity and specificity for the secondary ion,detecting very low elemental concentration;and(i) high mass resolution,which can be 22 times between minimum mass and maximum mass,so the instrument is able to detect most elements in the periodic table,from hydrogen to uranium,as well as their different isotopes [35,36].These characteristics offer many advantages for the analysis of elemental distributions in plant cells at the cellular and,crucially,subcellular level.NanoSIMS has been applied to plantsina numberof studies particularly those trying to resolve the distribution of chemical elements in the centralvacuole, cytoplasm,and cell wall,forwhich the high resolution is required [37-40].

Surprisingly,results in the present paperclearly indicate that salt-treated $( 2 0 0 \\mathrm { m M N a C l } )$ L. bicolorsalt gland cellsaccumulated higheramountsof $\\operatorname { K } ^ { + }$ than in those of control $( 0 \\mathrm { m M N a C l } ) ,$ plants;in particular, $\\operatorname { K } ^ { + }$ in the nuclei was much higher than that in the cytoplasm both in salt-treated and control salt gland cells (Fig.3E,F). Relative signal strength of $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ in the cytoplasm and nucleus ofNaCl-treated salt gland cellswas 16.5 and 21.9 times of control, respectively (Fig. 4A). The accumulation of $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ in the cytoplasm and nucleus may be a contributory factor to salinity tolerance although the exact mechanism between higher $\\operatorname { K } ^ { + }$ concentration and salinity tolerance is not known.The cytoplasm and nucleus are the centre of metabolic activities such as protein biosynthesis,gene selective expression and regulation [61]. $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ plays an important role in the activation of the function of enzymes and balances the negative charges on proteins and nucleic acids[62]. Salt secretion of the salt gland is an active physiological process depending on gene expression,protein synthesis,and ATP formation in response to salinity stress [12].Taken together, we suppose that $\\mathrm { K } ^ { + }$ accumulation in the cytoplasm and nucleus of NaCl-treated salt gland cells may enhance or stabilize macromolecule synthesis such as proteins and nucleic acids in order to secrete excess salts out of plant cells under salt stress,which is essential for salt secretion,because salt secretion is an energydependent process.When grown under salinity,these plants are ‘stressed'and K appears to substitute for Na in the salt-secretion mechanism.

        "text": "The ${ \\mathsf { N a } } ^ { + }$ signal was specifically high in the intercellular space of both control (Fig.3G) and NaCl-treated salt gland cells (Fig. 3H) compared to the symplast.The salt gland is encapsulated bya thick cuticular layer(c) except along the region of the walls between the collecting cells (co) and the outer cup cells (Fig.1A). This noncuticularized wall region is termed the transfusion area,where ions move from mesophyll cells to the salt gland cells.The major portion of the transpiration water moves from the apoplast to the symplast at the vein endings,so it isprobable that the salts,like the water,enter the symplast at the vein endings,then are transported through plasmodesmata(Fig.1D).The thick cuticle extended over thesecretorycells creatinga cavity between the cuticularlayerand the cell wall of the secretory cells.If salts are transported into the collecting chamber,resulting in the osmotic flow of water into the chamber,osmotic equilibrium within the tissue could be reached before a sufficient hydrostatic pressure develops to force the salty fluid to be secreted through the secretory pores of the salt gland within the cuticle.This indicates that there may be both an apoplastic and a symplastic pathway in the secretion of ${ \\mathsf { N a } } ^ { + }$ to the outer surface of the leaf of L.bicolor[12,13,64,65]. ${ \\mathsf { N a } } ^ { + }$ accumulation in the apoplast of salt gland cells resulted from enhanced ${ \\mathsf { N a } } ^ { + }$ secretion (Figs. 6 and 7B).

        "text": "Although the NanoSIMS has many clear advantages such as sufficient analytical sensitivity and high spatial resolution to allow the distribution of elements in these HPF/FS specimens to be visually mapped at the subcellular level, the technique does suffer from a number of shortcomings,which can limit its use.One of the main problems is that quantification is very difficult because the yield of secondary ions from each element is different depending on the electron affinity for negative ions and the ionisation potential for positive ions.Topography can also have a distinct effect on the yield of ions from the sample,restriction of NanoSIMS is that so sensitive to topography of the sample that flat microtome specimens arerequired.Only flat samples are introduced into the instrument so that real compositional variations are observed rather than just topographical variations.SIMS subjects to the strong matrix effects, and hence signals from the matrix as heterogeneous as plant materialswill be detected simultaneously.Biological materials suffer from matrix effects because there can be large variations in the chemistry and structure of the sample in different cells.In general, it has been found that the matrix effects in resin-embedded sample are minimal [67].Furthermore,TEManalysis determines the correct interpretation of the histological features for the NanoSIMS chemical maps,so the structural preservation of the sample is very crucial.Another concern is the methods used to preserve the specimens prior to analysis.The HPF/FS technique applied here (quick freezing and slow substitution of vitreous ice with chemical fixative)helps to minimize the redistribution of soluble cellular components,but the extent of possible elemental redistribution during sample preparation isan important factor in the preparation of biological specimens for chemical analysis,so the preservation in situ testifies to the effectiveness of the HPF/FS protocol in preserving the distribution of soluble elements.
