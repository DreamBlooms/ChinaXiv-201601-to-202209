        "text": "Top quark measurements provide important tests of QCD.Beter understanding of perturbative and non-perturbative effects is required to obtain the highest possible precision in top quark mass, its interpretation and in other properties. Top quark measurements are also important to improve the accuracy of predictions in diferent phase space regions in searches for beyond the Standard Model (SM) effects. Precise top quark measurements are also be used in direct searches for new physics as wel, e.g. with efective field theories expanding the SMLagrangian. For these purposes, the uncertainties in the measurements and the predictions need to be at a level where deviations of the predictions of the Monte Carlo (MC) codes or deviations due to new physics effects be visible. State-of-the-art next-to-leading order (NLO) matrix element (ME) event generators interfaced to new parton shower (PS) codes used in LHC Run II may provide better modelling and eventually reduce the major theoretical uncertainties. The theory uncertainties can partially be tested and improved with datasets that allow differential measurements with well-defined top-quark objects. In this note, a selection of recent top quark event modelling studies from CMS[1] are discussed. ",

In these calculations the concept of top quark as a particle is not well-defined and MC dependent. One can only use the kinematics of the final-state particles unambiguously. A particle-level top quark (also called pseudo-top quark) can be constructed from the final-state objects after hadronisation. Using particle-level top quarks would yield smaller uncertainties from non-perturbative effects and from acceptance corrections because of the similar phase definitions at the particle and detector levels minimising MC dependence.The details of particle-level top quark definitions and their adoption in the RIVET[2] framework in the official CMS reconstruction code are discussed in [3] as a fundamental aspect for current and future measurements of differential production cross sections in both $t \\hat { t }$ and single-top quark production. The results reported in [3] indicate that the particle-level top quark definition needs to be optimised depending on the production mode, the final state or the variable and the phase space being investigated.

Therefore,to improve top quark mass measurements,dedicated measurements and theory studies are required.The the b quark from the top quark decay carries the colour flow. To become colourless,the b quark \"connects\" with the beam remnants or other coloured final particles produced in the event.Ab jet in the final state can be constructed however the uncertainty in the origin of allthe final states in the jet results in \"odd clusters\" (e.g. see [5]).

The transverse region is particularly sensitive to the modelling of the UE. The PYTHIA8 tune CUETP8M1 and the HERWIG $^ { + + }$ tune EE5c [6] are reconstructed by fitting the UE data at several centre-of-mass energies,where the leading object is the highest $p _ { T }$ charged particle or the charged-particle jet in the event. These tunes describe well the UE as measured in Z-boson production. However,very litle is known about UE in heavy quark production. Ref.[7] compared detector-level top-quark production data at $1 3 \\mathrm { T e V }$ with the PYTHIA8 CUETP8M1 tune and the HERWIG $^ { + + }$ EE5C tune after detector simulation in $t \\hat { t }$ enriched events in the lepton+jets channel. Both of the parton shower models are interfaced with POWHEG V2.Fair agreement is observed between POWHEG V2+PYTHIA8 CUETP8M1 tune predictions.It is also observed that UE is sensitive to QCD scales. Fig.1a displays the charged-particle multiplicity when the PS scale is increased from its default value.A complete measurement of UE in $t \\hat { t }$ events at particle-level may lead to more precise top quark mass with better understood systematic uncertainties.

Accurate predictions of this observable is particularly important in measurements of the Higgs boson and many new physics search analysis. To improve the description of high jet multiplicities in $t \\overline { { t } }$ events,a number of parameters have been studied and the most sensitive ones to jet kinematics in $t \\hat { t }$ events are selected and optimised. The strong coupling parameter at $m _ { Z }$ fornitilsaeaoe $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R }$ , and the $h _ { d a m p }$ parameter that controls the jet matching in the POWHEG $^ { \\mathrm { v } 2 + }$ PYTHIA8 [13,14, 15] setup are tuned using Run 1 data on jet activity in $t \\hat { t }$ events. The Monash tune for $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R }$ adopts the $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { F S R }$ value tuned to LEP event shapes. This is found to be the main cause of overproduction of jets in the MC. We tuned the values of $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R }$ and $h _ { d a m p }$ usingthe jetmutiplicityandleadingadiioaljet $p _ { T }$ （20 distributions in the dilepton final state measured at $\\sqrt { s } = 8 \\mathrm { T e V }$ using the PROFESSOR tool [16]. In this procedure,allother PYTHIA8 parameters are kept fixed to the ones in CUETP8M1 tune. It is observed that $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R }$ impacts mostly $N _ { j e t s } > 3$ ，while $h _ { d a m p }$ affects the ratio of 2-to-3-jet events and the leading additional jet $p _ { T }$ . This is in agreement with the fact that the leading additional jet, in the POWHEG V2+PYTHIA8 configuration, stems from the real radiation calculated by the POWHEG V2generatoeuingprocedueyes $h _ { d a m p } = 1 . 5 8 1 _ { - 0 . 5 8 5 } ^ { + 0 . 6 5 8 } \\times m _ { t }$ and $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R } = 0 . 1 1 0 8 _ { - 0 . 0 1 4 2 } ^ { + 0 . 0 1 4 5 }$ The tuned $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R }$ value agrees with the PDG value of $\\alpha _ { s } ( M _ { Z } ) = 0 . 1 1 8 1 \\pm 0 . 0 0 1 1$ [17] well within uncertainties.Fixing $h _ { d a m p }$ to its default value of $m _ { t }$ , a re-tuning of $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R }$ alone to the same data yields $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R } = 0 . 1 1 5 _ { - 0 . 0 1 9 } ^ { + 0 . 0 2 1 }$ [18]gintieO8i these optimised parameters cures the overshoot of the CUETP8M1 at high jet multiplicities.

[1O] for the details of the CUETP8M2T4 tune derived fixing $\\alpha _ { s } ^ { I S R }$ to 0.1108. The performance of the CUETP8M2T4 PYTHIA8 tune is evaluated in different configurations.
