In this study, we investigated the composition of plant community, plant-soil C:N:P stoichiometry and their relationships during secondary successon after the abandonmentof farmlands forO,10,20,30,40 and 50 a in China,2016.Results showed that the composition of plant communities was most diverse in the farmlands after secondary succession for 2O and $5 0 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ，Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents slightly decreased after secondary succession for $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ，but both were significantly higher than those of control farmland ( $3 1 . 2 1 \\% - 1 3 9 . 1 0 \\%$ and $2 4 . 2 4 \\% - 1 2 1 . 2 1 \\%$ ,respectively). Moreover, C:N ratios of soil and microbe greatly contributed to the changes in plant community composition during secondary succession of abandoned farmlands,explaining $3 5 . 7 0 \\%$ of the total variation. Particularly, soil C:N ratio was significantly and positively related with the Shannon-Wiener index.This study provides the evidence of synchronous evolution between plant community and soil during secondary successon and C:N ratio is an important linkage between them.

Correspondingly， the biomassand nutrient composition of plants,through the return of liter, affect the physical characteristics,nutrient content and microbial composition in soil (Chen and Chen, 2O18).This change provides a good template for us to study the process of natural coordinated plant-soil recovery under temporal changes (Zhao et al.,2O13).Especially, the ecological stoichiometry that is an important indicator reflecting the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) cycles inside the soil (Zechmeister-Boltenstern et al.,2Ol5) integrates the variability of ecosystem function and is widely used in the study of limitative nutrient element determination (Zhou et al., 2018), biogeochemical cycles and population dynamics (Martiny et al., 2016; Busch et al., 2O18; Couic et al.，2O18). During the process of secondary succession of abandoned farmlands，the relationship between the changes in ecological stoichiometric ratio and the aboveground plant community succession is unknown. Studying this issue will help us to understand the nutrient cycle in the succession of ecosystems and also improve our understanding of the direction and drivers of community restoration. ",

        "text": "During natural restoration, plant coverage and community composition significantly change (Zhao et al.,2O19). However, there is still debate about how plant community diversity changes. One argument is the classical theory, indicating that the richness continues to increase along the plant succession (Clements,1936; Margalef,1963); the other is the intermediate species-richness hypothesis,indicating that the species richness firstly increases,and then decreases during the succession (Bazzaz, 1975). Changes in species diversity are determined by the differences in the community habitats and interspecific relationships (Odum,1969; Hessen et al., 2OO4; Hu et al., 2009). Climatic conditions of the loess plateau are the most important factors affecting secondary succession (Ma et al.， 2O18). For example,nutrient poverty and water limitation on the loess plateau limit the development of plant community. However, the pattern of soil nutrients' accumulation and its mechanisms are not well understood during secondary succession (Thuille and Schulze, 2OO6), which poses an obstacle to our study on the synergistic recovery of plant and soil. Therefore,we hypothesized that changes in soil and plant may be unified with more intrinsic factors,such as the C:N:P stoichiometric ratio and microbial regulation (Bonanomi et al.,2005). Plants fix carbon through photosynthesis,absorb nitrogen from soil through the rhizosphere and mycorrhiza, adapt to their nutrient needs and maintain a certain C:N ratio. In turn, soil and microorganisms are fed back through liter. C:N ratio reflects plant growth capacity, embodies the key process of soil and plant nutrient exchange and return,and affects the accumulation and stoichiometric ratio of nutrients in plant and soil (Luo et al.,2004).

        "text": "The growth of plants is often limited by soil nutrients, especially N and P contents (Elser et al., 2003).Limited nutrients significantly influence the composition and development of plant community. For example, Ning et al. (2O17) found that legumes in N-deficient soils had a growth advantage.Therefore,the balance of soil nutrients affects the interspecific competition of plants, and then afects the succession of community. Microbe plays a subtle role between soil and plant (Wall and Moore,1999). The leguminous rhizobium that is symbiotic with leguminous plants, converts nitrogen from air to feed the plants,but microbe and plant also compete for nutrients in barren soil (Ning et al., 2O17).As the most active factor in soil, microorganisms are the main factor of soil nutrient transformation (Liang et al.,2O17).They absorb nutrients from the soil and return to the soil after synthesis and transformation.Microbe determines the effectiveness of nutrients in the soil and is linked to the use of nutrients by aboveground plants. Hence, microorganisms regulate the relationship between soil and plant. Thus,we can speculate that C:N:P stoichiometric ratios of soil and plant are closely related to the characteristics of plant community, and different plants have diverse adaptations to nutrient ratios.

Coupled with climate drought, the ecological environment is very fragile (Yao et al.,2013). In order to restore the ecology and prevent soil erosion, there is a series of projects implemented,such as the \"Grain for Green\" project， which has greatly improved the local ecological environment (Liu and Fu, 2O13). More than $9 . 2 6 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 6 } \\ \\mathrm { h m } ^ { 2 }$ farmlands had been converted into forests or grassands from 1999 to 2010 (Zhang et al.,2013). This conversion provides a good template to understand the fundamental ecological patterns and processes of biotic communities during secondary succession. Previous studies have shown that soil nutrients and plant characteristics significantly changed during secondary succession. However, there are still controversies about the changing characteristics and complex relationships between soil and plant, which is an obstacle to our understanding of the coordinated restoration of soil-plant during secondary succession.Therefore， this study focused on（1） the synergetic restoration of plant-soil-microbe nutrients,and (2） the relationship between plant community and C:N:P stoichiometric ratio during secondary succession. The results would give us a new perspective on the relationship between plant and soil. The aims of this study are to explore: (1) the synergistic changes in plant-soil-microbe nutrient and C:N:P stoichiometric ratio during secondary succession after abandonment,(2） the changes in composition and characteristics of plant community,and (3) the effect of C:N:P stoichiometric ratio on plant community.

The speciesnumber and individual number comprehensively represent the characteristics of the plant community, which is linked to the developmental stage and stability of the plant community. The relative frequencies of the plant species within the quadrat were ranked in diminishing order, and a smooth curve was established using the cumulative values. This curve intersects the line $x + y = 1 0 0$ at one point. The Euclidean distance between this intersection and point 20/80 indicates the proximity degree of the actual community to the stable community.

This difference was reflected in the stoichiometric ratio of each component (Zhang et al.,2O18b).The secondary succession of abandoned farmland resulted in significant increases in the C,N and $\\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ P ~ }$ contents of various parts of the ecosystem, indicating that nutrients were accumulated as the succession proceeded. However, nutrient (C and N) contents of soil and plant peaked after 3O a of recovery and slightly decreased in the later stage, which may be related to the absolute superiority of the later stage of succession. In addition, trend of soil moisture firstly increased and then decreased, just like that of nutrients, indicating that the changes of soil moisture and nutrients were synergistic. For example, some studies have mentioned that the increase of soil moisture can significantly improve the activity of microorganisms,thereby promoting the transfer of soil nutrients by microorganisms and improving the accumulation of soil nutrients (Cruz-Martinez et al.,2012; Liang et al.,2O17). The changes of soil moisture and nutrients afect the developmental direction of plant community.During the transition period from grass to shrub community,annual plants were gradually replaced by perennials, nutrients in the ecosystem were transferred to plants, and nutrient contents in soil were slightly reduced.

Therefore,variation in $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ content is not significant. C and N contents significantly contributed to the variation in ecological stoichiometry. During secondary succession process, C:N ratio is more reflective of the relationship between soil and biological groups (plant and microbe). In this study, soil C:N ratio showed a decreasing trend with the restored ages, which is due to the higher accumulation rate of N than that of C.Furthermore, C:N ratio is lower than the average level in China (10.1-12.1) (Wang,2008). The lower C:N ratio indicates a faster decomposition rate of minerals into the soil and a shorter cycle of nutrients, which may be related to the superior adaptability of grass in the ecosystem (Erktan et al., 2016). However, it also indicates a poor soil C sequestration capacity (Sterner and Elser, 2OO2). This may be due to the previous soil erosion and degradation, which had seriously damaged C and N cycles. Plant and microbe had parallel correlations with the soil C:N:P stoichiometric ratio, implying that biological groups in the ecosystem had underlying relationships with active nutrient acquisition (Jaeger et al.,1999; Grigulis et al.，2O13). For example, C sequestration capacity of plant and microbe gradually increased with the age of abandonment, i.e.,the amount of carbon fixed per unit of nitrogen increased (Ratnam et al.， 2Oo8). Therefore, during secondary succession of abandoned farmlands, nutrient use efficiency of plant communities continuously improved. ",

The overall increase trend was observed in terms of the diversity (Shannon-Wiener index), stability (Euclidean distance),and richness (Margalef index) of plant communities on abandoned farmlands. Climax plant community appeared after the farmland was abandonment for $4 0 \\textrm { a }$ ,and was dominated by Artemisia gmelinii. However, Godron et al. (1971) found that stability index of abandoned farmlands is unstable.This implies that the climate in the loess hilly region is a constraint on the succession of grass community (Wang et al.,2OO9; Han et al., 2010),which might be further replaced by the shrub community. Especially in the Chinese Loess Plateau, soil moisture is the most critical factor in the development of grassland ecosystem (Zhao and Hu,2Oo8). Studies have shown that secondary succession of plant community in the abandoned farmlands underwent the following process,i.e., annual herbaceous was the absolute dominant species,then annual and perennial herbaceous competitively existed,and gradually, shrubs began to appear and became the dominant species. Meanwhile, diversity and richness indices of plant community were significantly affected by soil moisture (Tables 1 and 4), which is consistent with the result of Haripal and Sahoo (2O11).In addition, the coverage, richness index, diversity and stability were higher after secondary succession for 2O a, indicating that plant community reached a relatively balanced point. Traces of truth can be found from the species composition. After abandonment for 2O a, Compositae and Leguminosae had the highest IV and species richness than those of the other stages; especially Compositae, whose heterogeneity was greater vertically and horizontally and led to the highest diversity. At the later stage of succession, increasing competition among plant species gradually decreased dominant species and community diversity，which is consistent with the hypothesis of Bazzaz (1975） and Rundel (1997).

The improvement and recovery of the soil matrix willinevitably promote the development of biomes (Ren et al.,2016; Ren et al., 2018). Corresponding to the change of plant diversity, the soil and microbial nutrients also showed an increasing trend (Zhang et al.，2O16).After abandonment for 20 to $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ，the contents of C and $\\mathbf { N }$ in plants,soil and microorganisms reached their maximums,while that of $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ was modestly improved. This shows that there is a potential synchronous relationship between soil and vegetation restoration. Studies have shown that during secondary succession of abandoned farmlands，there is a relationship between vegetation restoration and soil nutrients that both affect and depend on each other and the dominant driving force gradually changes from soil nutrients to vegetation.This phenomenon also results in that the development of soil often lags behind the change of vegetation characteristics (Jiao et al., 2006). This is consistent with our results (Tables 1 and 3).When we try to find the coupling point through the relationships among C:N:P ratios of soil, microbes and plants, we find that the C:N ratio is the decisive factor for the change in plant community and its cumulative contribution percentage reaches $5 0 . 6 \\%$ . Due to the substantial stable source of P,C:N determines the availability and balance of nutrients to microbe in the soil and promotes the nutrient efficiency for plant driven by microbe turnover in the soil. Different plant functional groups have different utilization preferences and efciency to soil nutrients,and the change in C:N in turn drives the changes in plant superiority and diversity. RDA analysis showed that Compositae had positive relationships with microbe C:N ratio and biomass C:N ratio, and a negative relationship with soil C:N ratio (Fig. 6). The accumulation of soil nutrients allows the establishment of the Compositae groups that have a strong allelopathic efect to inhibit the growth of other plants through root exudates (Zhou et al., 2OO4). Its short and flexible growing cycle and numerous small seeds both establish its advantage over the interspecific competition (Sutherland,2OO4; Hao et al.,2009). Thus, during the succession of abandoned farmlands, C:N ratio mainly drives the development of Compositae community. ",
