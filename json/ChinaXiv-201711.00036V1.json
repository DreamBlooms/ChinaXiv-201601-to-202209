By decoupling the evaporator and heat source,the capillary force is generated by loading heat directly on the evaporator,which force drives the fluid to absorb the heat produced by CCD components and release it through condensers.

However, compared with the experimental investigations, only a few studies on the theoretical analyses and mathematical modeling of LHP have been conducted so far. Accurate LHP model is needed to study the thermal performance,particularly in the orbital transients.The LHP system involves complex heat and mass transfer processes, rendering the mathematical modeling highly challenging. A number of steady-state models with varying levels of complexity have been proposed,which prove to be useful in predicating steady-state performance characteristics.Kaya et al. [9] developed a one dimensional （1D） mathematical model of LHP,which could reflect the variable conductance characteristics,but the oversimplification in the model brought large difference between the modeling and experimental results.A 1D steady-state model based on the energy balance equation,thermodynamic relationships and heat transfer and pressure drop calculations was developed by Chuang [10]. Improvement included the pressure drop induced by the bends,the convective heat transfer in the vapor grooves and heat fluxes in the wick.Adoni et al.[11] established a model to study the thermal and hydraulic performance of LHP, by using the mass and energy equations in the system.Additionally, the pressure drop across the capillary wick is calculated by the Darcy's law.Bai et al.[12] developed a model to study the effect of a two-layer compound wick, based on the energy conservation equations and empirical correlations.Riviere et al. [13] modeled a LHP based on the classic nodal network to study the fluid distribution in a loop. ",

This model is used by several researchers,such as in Refs.[18] and[19].Compared with the test results, the predicted temperature showed litle differences (less than $1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ).For the aspect of orbital simulation,Ferrandi et al.[2O] established a transient model to design and simulate the thermal control system of LHP by Sinda/Fluint analyzer,which is used for the cooling of the cryomagnet avionics box on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02).Xin et al.
