Studies have shown that flavonoids have good antioxidant activity, cardiovascular disease prevention, anti-cancer activity, anti-inflammatory， antibacterial activity， antiviral activity， free anticoagulant， antithrombotic, etc.[42l.Li et al.[43-45] reported that flavonoids from $F .$ margarita had significant antioxidant effects and promoted the immune function of mice,as well as significantly relieved symptom of diabetes in mice. Chen et al.l46] reported that the total flavonoids could protect the liver of acute alcoholism of mice.Antioxidant tests of flavonoids from kumquat showed that the inhibition rates of flavonoids against DPPH· and ABTS· were up to $79 \\%$ and $93 \\%$ , respectively[40].

It is an important secondary metabolite in the plant, which is the second major metabolite of the plant followed by the flavonoids. Most of the phenolic acids in $F .$ margarita are the hydroxylated derivatives of cinnamic and benzoic acids[47l. The coumaric, chlorogenic,caffeic,erucic and ferulic acids from $F .$ margarita in Taiwan were determined using HPLC by Wang et al.l48l. They found the ferulic and erucic acids were the most important soluble phenolic acids in $F .$ margarita peel. Some studies had shown that $F .$ margarita phenolic acids had various biological activities, such as anti-virus,anti-inflammatory,anti-alergy, immune function antibacterial activity,pest control effect, etc. $F .$ margarita peels contained the high total amounts of lutein, zeaxanthin, $\\beta$ -cryptoxanthin and $\\beta$ carotene,which exhibited antioxidant activity， anti-cancer activity, enhancing immune function， preventing osteoporosis， preventing night blindness， preventing cardiovascular disease，anti-aging activity， inhibiting tumor cells growth， and so on[48].F. margarita also contained a certain amount of dietary fiber, which could increase the activity of metabolic granules in order to prevent constipation[16].

The limonoids and flavonoids can be utilized as natural antibacterial and antioxidant agents in functional food and pharmaceutical industry， respectively. The essential oils have been developed as raw materials in Chinese daily chemical industry,such as sunscreen, skin cream, hand cream and soap. ",

        "text": "In this review,when going through the literatures, it was observed that there are sufficient amount of bioactive compounds in $F .$ margarita. The structural features of bioactive compounds contributed to their biological activities. The polysaccharide wasa macromolecular heteropolysaccharide,containing four kinds of polysaccharide fractions with different molecular weight. Different polysaccharide fractions displayed antibacterial,antioxidant activities and hypolipidemic effect. The limonoids were composed of limonin and nomilin, which had anti-cancer activity,anti-inflammatory activity,anti-anxiety activity,sedation effect, cholesterol regulation and prevention atherosclerosis.Essential oils from $F .$ margarita peel were mainly composed of D-limonene,myrcene and $\\beta$ -pinene while linoleic acid,methyl palmitate and oleinic acid were the major components of $F .$ margarita seed oils.Essential oils displayed the antimicrobial,antioxidant activities and drosophila lure effect. The flavonoids were mainly composed of vicenin-2,narirutin $4 ^ { \\prime }$ -O-glucoside，phloretin $_ { 3 } , _ { , 5 } ,$ -di-C-glucoside, rhoifolin， acacetin 8-C-neohesperidoside,didymin， which had a strong capacity to eliminate free radicals. Therefore,evidence suggests that bioactive compounds from $F .$ margarita have potentials as active ingredients for preparing various functional foods, pharmaceutical and daily chemical products due to their valuable biological functions and beneficial health effects.

The polysaccharideswere a macromolecular heteropolysaccharide, containing four kinds of polysaccharide fractions with different molecular weights. Different polysaccharide fractions displayed antibacterial,antioxidant activities and hypolipidemic effect. This functionality was affected by the monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage, molecular weight and chain conformation in aqueous. ",
