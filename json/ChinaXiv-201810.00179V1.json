        "text": "Abstract: Salt-affected soils are mostly found in irrigated areas within arid and semi-arid regions where the groundwater table is shallw. Soils of this type have become an increasingly severe problem because they threaten both the environment and the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture. A tool to estimate phreatic evaporation is therefore urgently required to minimize the salinization potential of salt-affected areas. In this context, phreatic evaporation at zero water table depth $( E _ { 0 } )$ is a key parameter for establishing a model for calculating phreatic evaporation. The aim of this study was to explore the law of phreatic evaporation and to develop structurally rational empirical models for calculating phreatic evaporation, based on $E _ { 0 }$ data of six types of soil (i.e., gravel, fine sand, sandy loam, light loam, medium loam, and heavy loam) observed using the non-weighing lysimeter and water surface evaporation $( E _ { 6 0 1 } )$ data observed using a E601 evaporator of same evaporation area with a lysimeter-tube at the groundwater balance station of the Weigan River Management Office in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, during the non-freezing period (April to October) between 1990 and 1994. The relationship between $E _ { 0 }$ and $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ was analyzed, the relationship between the ratio of $E _ { 0 }$ to $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ and the mechanical compositions of different soils was presented, and the factors influencing $E _ { 0 }$ were discussed. The results of this study reveal that $E _ { 0 }$ is not equal to $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ . In fact, only values of the former for fine sand are close to those of the latter. Data also show that $E _ { 0 }$ values are related to soil texture as well as to potential atmospheric evaporation, the ratio of $E _ { 0 }$ to $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ and the silt-clay particle content (grain diameter less than $0 . 0 2 { \\mathrm { ~ m m } } ^ { \\cdot }$ is negatively exponentiall correlated,and that soil thermal capacity plays a key role in phreatic evaporation at $E _ { 0 }$ . The results of this analysis therefore imply that the treatment of zero phreatic depth is an essential requirement when constructing groundwater balance stations to study the law of phreatic evaporation.

        "text": "Phreatic evaporation from bare soil is a process that transfers water from phreatic zone to unsaturated zone before it passes into the air via soil evaporation. Understanding this process is of great importance to a range of research fields, including hydrology, hydrogeology, soil physics, and agriculture, especially in the context of evaluating water resource and calculating farmland drainage (Jin, 1982; Qu et al., 1983; Zhang, 1986, 1996, 2013; Huo and Wang, 1988; Lei et al., 1988; Shen, 1992; Wang,1993; Wang et al., 1994; Zhang and Shen, 1998; Ma et al., 2006; Su and Tao, 2Oo9). In arid and semi-arid regions where areas with a shallow groundwater table, this process is a particular issue because considerable amounts of water are lost to the atmosphere and salts are accumulated within upper parts of the soil profile. In places where the groundwater table is shallow, evaporation can also lead to increasingly severe soil salinization problems which result in a surface salt crust that hampers agricultural activities (Zarei et al., 2OO2, 2OO9); such crusts also threaten the environment and sustainable agricultural development in these regions (Williams, 1987) and are therefore critical factors affecting the stability of oasis agro-ecosystems. Soil secondary salinization is particularly serious within the Xinjiang region of northwestern China because of the evaporation of groundwater with less rainfall, a larger evaporation rate overall,and a shallow water table (Shi et al.,2Ol3).At the same time, however, direct evaporation measurements over large scales are problematic, costly, time consuming, and often impractical (Zarei et al., 2O1O). It is therefore essential to establish a tool to estimate phreatic evaporation (capillary rise) to minimize the salinization potential within salt-affected areas. In this context, Averianov (1956) proposed an empirical equation to estimate phreatic evaporation (Eq. 1). ",

        "text": "Even though the relationship between $E _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ and $H$ is limited in expression,it has nevertheless been widely applied because it is a simple expresson and requires fewer parameters (Zhang, 1986; Zammouri, 2001; Yang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013). At the same time, although the intensity of phreatic evaporation when the water table reaches the ground surface is an important parameter within the Averianov equation, limited research has been carried out regarding $E _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ when $H$ is zero. There are currently four main views regarding the relationship between phreatic evaporation and water table depth. The first view is that the phreatic evaporation at zero water table depth $( E _ { 0 } )$ is equal to, or approximate to, water surface evaporation $( E _ { 6 0 1 } )$ (Huo and Wang, 1988; Tang et al., 1989; Zhang, 1996; Guan, 2010; Xu, 2011; Shen and Huang, 2015). The second view is that phreatic evaporation at $E _ { 0 }$ is more than $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ (Shi and Liang, 1964; Liang, 1992; Tindall et al., 1999; Fang, 2009; Han et al., 2009; Rui, 2014)， while the third argument holds that phreatic evaporation at $E _ { 0 }$ is not equal to $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ (Zheng, 1951; Don and William, 1958). The final view in this context suggests that phreatic evaporation is the same as $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ when the depth of the water table is less than decoupling depth or that of the evapotranspiration (ET) surface (Wang,1993; Cook and Rassam, 2002; Shah et al., 2007; Ridolfi et al.,2008; Johnson et al., 2010). In an earlier study, Saxena et al. (1971) noted that water is lost readily from most soils at rates comparable to those from a free water surface when the water table is shallower than $6 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ ,while Hillel (1998) considered $E _ { 0 }$ to be equivalent to potential evaporation. In a later study carried out in Tunisia, Zammouri (2OO1) noted that the Averianov equation provides more accurate estimates of $E _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ than either the Gardner or MODFLOW approaches， while Blight (20O2） concluded that more evaporation may occur from the bare soil surface than from the water surface. In a series of studies carried out within the Tarim River Basin, Yu (1993), Mao et al. (1998), Shang et al.(1999), and Hu et al. (2Oo9) established a series of empirical equations for estimating $E _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ based on experimental data collected at the Qongkol, Shache, and Aksu water balance experimental stations in South Xinjiang，but in the absence of $E _ { 0 }$ measurements. Additional information regarding phreatic evaporation intensity when the water table depth is zero should therefore be obtained to enable further studies regarding whether, or not, the phreatic evaporation at $E _ { 0 }$ approximates $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ ",

Cylinders used to control water table depths less than $1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { m }$ were installed on both sides of the observation gallery, while those used to control water table depths more than $1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ were installed around the underground observation room (Fig. 2).

Gravity drainage was recorded by the collector, while the water supplied to each lysimeter from the Marriotte bottle was measured three times a day at 08:00, 14:00, and 2O:0O (LST).

This corroborates the earlier findings of Don and Willian (1958), but conflicts with some other previous researches. It is generally recognized that when soils are very wet, the evaporation of water is governed by external atmospheric conditions rather than by their inherent properties; evaporation rate is therefore equivalent to potential rate, referred to as \"potential evaporation\", i.e., $E _ { 6 0 1 }$ ( Hanks and Ashcroft, 1984; Jury et al., 1991; Hanks, 1992; Hillel, 1998, 2004; Lal and Shukla, 2004).
