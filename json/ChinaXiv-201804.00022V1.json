The surface activity of $H .$ reaumuri at the population scale was observed by collcting the hourly active individuals from the sunrise to the sunset of the studied day in each month of 2O13 in the Bchachma locality,Tunisia.The collected active individuals were put in perspex boxes (on which we labeled the hourly time interval in which the individuals were collcted) in the field and then transported to the laboratory for analysis. Individuals were counted,sexed and measured in the laboratory. Despite desert conditions in the studied site, $H .$ reaumurii was characterized by a diurnal surface activity, showing a bimodal pattern during the warm months (i.e., May to October). However, it exhibited a unimodal surface activity pattern in the cold months (i.e.， February, March and November). The surface activity was significantly correlated with sunrise and sunset. Moreover, a significant quadratic effect of temperature on the surface activity of $H .$ reaumurii was observed.Furthermore, the study showed that the most important surface activity was recorded in March. The daily exploitation of the temporal niches was significantly different as a function of months. The body size of males were larger than that of females,and the body size of active individuals would change with months. All these behavioural changes in the surface activity represent an adaptive strategy of life in the arid environment. ",

In fact, temperature appears to be an important determinant of temporal activity patterns for arthropods. Unlike terrestrial isopods,the burrowing isopod Hemilepistus reaumurii(Crustacea), which is commonly distributed in the arid regions of North Africa,Middle East and Central Asia, exhibits a daily activity pattern (Nasri-Ammar and Morgan,2005; Nasri-Ammar et al., 2016; Ayari et al.,2017).

This can explain that during December and January, in which temperature fell below a certain threshold $( 6 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } - 1 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\mathrm { - } 1 8 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ，respectively),individuals of $H .$ ，reaumurii completely stop their surface activity to avoid desiccation and remain into their burrows. The start of quiescence observed during these two months would be considered as an adaptation to avoid the cold winter temperatures. Furthermore， the highest number of active $H .$ reaumurii individuals over the year was concentrated at temperatures of $1 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\mathrm { - } 2 9 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ，which suggests that these temperature values represent the optimal limits of air temperature for the surface activity of $H .$ reaumurii individuals. Our findings are in agreement with those of Nasri et al. (1996), who demonstrated experimentally that individuals of $H .$ .reaumurii exposed to a long photoperiod (15-h light/9-h dark) could stop their growth and reproduction at $1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .The present results of the photophase exploitation over the year may confirm the effect of temperature on the surface activity of $H .$ reaumurii individuals. Our results show that photophase is more exploited in March,April and November than in the other months. During these three months (March，April and November)， the recorded temperatures ranged between $1 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $2 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ，which represent the favourable temperatures for the maximum exploitation of photophase.Furthermore, the photophase is less exploited during June and July in which the recorded temperatures were the highest. Thus,our first hypothesis that $H .$ （204号 reaumurii would reduce its surface locomotor activity during the warmest months while increase its daily period of surface activity during the months with suitable temperatures is verified.

This crucial period of life cycle could explain the high intensity of surface activity during this month. In June (the specific month for the activity of females,coinciding with the end of the reproductive period), we noticed a larger number of females on the surface compared to males，probably because females had to compensate for metabolism losses during reproduction by increasing their foraging activity. During this period, most of the males remained in their burrows and took care of their offspring (Shachak,1980; Linsenmair,1984; Baker, 2005). Males were specifically more active in ",

The restriction of surface activity around sunrise and sunset during hot months was observed in the dune beetle Erodius sauditus (Robinson and Clayton, 2001) and in the Sahara scorpion Androctonus australis when the daily temperature differences on the sand surface might exceed $6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (Fleissner and Fleissner,1998).

Ashoff (1986) highlighted that for day-active animals,the beginning of surface activity was phased with the dawn. According to Fleissner and Fleissner (2Oo2), various organisms may recognize a certain moment during dawn and follow this signal as an individually defined set point throughout changing seasonal conditions. Cloudsley-Thompson （1991） indicated that the decision to be active or not results from various cues available to the organisms after they are aroused by their circadian clock. Unlike other various desert arthropods (Cloudsley-Thompson,1991; Alpato et al, 1994)，the locomotor behaviour of $H .$ reaumurii under controlled environmental conditions received litte attention (Nasri-Ammar and Morgan,2O05; Ayari et al.,2O17). Nasri-Ammar and Morgan (2005) and Ayari et al. (2O17) studied the locomotor rhythm of pairs of $H .$ reaumurii in the laboratory，and showed that this species exhibited a diurnal locomotor activity with two activity peaks,which occurred respectively around sunrise and sunset. They also demonstrated that the locomotor rhythm of $H .$ reaumurii was controlled by an endogenous circadian clock with period approximately closing to $2 4 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ ，Similar to other desert species such as the tenebrionid beetles Trigonoscelis gigas (Alpato et al.,1994; Alpatov et al.,1999; Zotov and Alpatov, 2004) and other insect species (Lewis et al.，1991)，the circadian clock of $H .$ reaumurii probably involved two oscillators.Exactly,one oscillator is synchronized with sunrise and the other one is synchronized with sunset. The crepuscular locomotor activity rhythm of $H .$ ，reaumurii clearly had an adaptive value in restricting its surface activity to coincide with optimal environmental conditions of light, temperature and relative humidity (Nasri-Ammar and Morgan, 2005).

        "text": "The monthly variation in the body size of active individuals could be explained by the decortication of the life cycle of $H .$ reaumurii at the study site.The dispersal phase started at the end of February and was followed by the pair formation period occurring from the end of March until April. The reproduction period that began in May was characterized by the presence of the reproductive females.These females realized only one brood per life cycle (Ayari et al.,2016b). Therefore, a lot of energy was spent during March-May which may explain the gradual decrease of the body size of active $H .$ ，reaumurii individuals.In June and July,a difference in body size between adults and juveniles was clearly observed (Ayari,unpublished data). During these two months, the body length of the majority of active $H .$ reaumurii individuals did not exceed $1 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ Adults did not exploit the temporal niches differently from juveniles and they just limited their surface activity during this period. Kennedy et al. (2OoO) studied the locomotor activity of the amphipod Orchestia tuberculata, and proved the existence of a significant negative influence on the survival of juveniles in the presence of adults by intraspecific predation. For the talitrid Orchestia gammarellus,Ayari et al. (2O15) mentioned the most important activity and stability of the locomotor rhythm for juveniles.The two months of June and July could be considered as the active period of the offspring for $H .$ reaumurii. From August to November, the body size of juveniles increased whereas a high percentage of mortality of adults was noted (Ayari et al., 2016b). To sum up, our third hypothesis that the body size of active individuals would change with months is verified. ",

The natural selection of large-size males could be an explanation of our result. In fact, SSD resulted from sexually antagonistic selection favouring different optimal body sizes for both genders.The evolution of independent size optima is constrained by genetic correlations between sexes,as well as the physiological, developmental and phylogenetic constraints (Blanckenhorn, 2OO7; Fairbairn, 2OO7). Smith and Brockmann (2014) pointed out that mate competition between males can contribute to the evolution of males with larger body size. ",
