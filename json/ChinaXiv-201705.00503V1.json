Furthermore,in contrast to that of diamond films,the N-DLC film with the atomically smooth surface can be deposited on virtually any substrate at ambient temperature.N-DLC or nitrogen-doped ta-C film electrode with prominently improved electrical and electrochemical properties had the desired voltammetric characteristics suitable for electrochemical analysis or water treatment [10,25-28]. Sopchak et al. [29] studied the detection of dopamine and ascorbate with N-DLC electrodes,and demonstrated the improved sensitivityand linear dynamic range.Liu and Liu [3O] reported that the N-DLC electrodes were sensitive to metal ions $( \\mathsf { C u } ^ { + } , \\mathsf { P b } ^ { + } )$ in aqueous solutions.In addition,Yang et al.[31] showed that N-DLC films without conventional pretreatment were characterized bya low background voltammetric current,a wide working potential window $( \\sim 3 \\mathsf { V } )$ ,and relatively rapid electron-transferkinetics foraqueousredox systems,including $\\mathsf { F e } ( \\mathsf { C N } ) _ { 6 } { } ^ { - 3 / - 4 }$ and $\\mathrm { R u } ( \\mathrm { N H _ { 3 } } ) _ { 6 } { } ^ { + 3 / + \\bar { 2 } }$ .

        "text": "Representatively, the N-DLC film electrode deposited at bias of $- 5 5 0 \\mathrm { V }$ is used to further investigate the electrochemical potential window in different solutions in order to explore its electrochemical evolution.Fig.5(b) shows the cyclic voltammograms of N-DLC film electrode deposited at bias of $- 5 5 0 \\mathrm { V }$ in 0.5 M $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } S 0 _ { 4 }$ and $0 . 1  { \\mathrm { M } }$ NaOH solution at the scan rate of $5 0 \\mathrm { m V } s ^ { - 1 }$ .It can be seen that the hydrogen evolution potential and oxygen evolution potential shift to the lower potentials to some extent in NaOH solution.This implies that the potential window of the N-DLC film electrode is closely dependent on the electrolyte.The N-DLC film electrode tested in the ${ \\sf H } _ { 2 } { \\sf S } { \\sf O } _ { 4 }$ solution exhibits a higher potential window of approximately 4.01Vcompared to approximately $2 . 9 1 \\mathrm { V }$ measured in the NaOH solution.Moreover, the oxygen evolution potential of the N-DLC film electrode in the solution containing higher concentration of $\\mathsf { H } ^ { + }$ ions is higher (approximately $2 . 1 \\mathrm { e V }$ ),compared to those of the film electrode in the solution containinga higher concentration of $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ (approximately $0 . 8 8 \\mathrm { e V }$ ).Therefore,itcould be said that the N-DLC film electrodes in acidic solutions would be easier for analysis of electrochemical active species with higher oxidation potential. Due to the charging effect of electrical doublelayercapacitance,the background current can be observed on both the cyclic voltammograms of the N-DLC film electrodes measured in ${ \\sf H } _ { 2 } { \\sf S } { \\sf O } _ { 4 }$ and NaOH solutions,while it was relatively smaller in acidic solution.Khun etal.[39] explained that,near the electrode, the $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ ions ionized from NaOH were easier reacted with the hydronium ions to form the water molecules.This kind of water layerwasadsorbed on the film electrode surface and the ions were surrounded by the water hydration sheath,causing the separationof the charges.Therefore,the cyclic voltammograms of the N-DLC film electrodes measured in the hydroxide solutions shows the higher background current.
