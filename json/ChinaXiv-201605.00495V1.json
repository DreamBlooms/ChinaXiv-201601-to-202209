Such pollutants could have adverse efects on the plant growth as well as microbial community in soil. Although biochar has been proposed as a 'carbon negative strategy' to mitigate the greenhouse gas emisions,the impacts of its application with respect to long-term persistence and bioavailability of hazardous components are not clear.Moreover,the co-occurrence of low molecular weight VOCs with PAHs in biochar may exert further phytotoxic efects.This review describes the basic need to unravel key mechanisms driving the storage vs.emisson of these organics and the dynamics between the sorbent (biochar) and soil microbes.Moreover,there is an urgent need for standardized methods for quantitative analysis of PAHs and VOCs in biochar under environmentally relevant conditions.This review is also extended to cover current research gaps including the influence of biochar application on the short- and long-term fate of PAHs and VOCs and the proper control tactics for biochar quality and associated risk.

PAHs are carcinogenic and persistent pollutants that are ubiquitously distributed in the environment and are some of the most difficult organic contaminants to treat (Edwards,1983;Cerniglia,1992). The VOCs，especially ethylene，may trigger various plant and microbial responses known as ‘soil volatilomics' by mimicking plant hormones and through additional mechanisms (Insam & Seewald,201O).The ppm-level VOCs can regulate the seed germination rates,herbivore resistance,weed response,and nutrient uptake(Simms & Rausher,1987;Ryu et al.,2003;Klinke et al.，2004;Kloepper et al.，2004;Baldwin et al.，2006; Zhang et al.，2007;Almeida et al.，2009;Graber et al., 2010).The co-occurrence of low molecular weight (LMW) VOCs with PAHs in biochar may further amplify the phytotoxic effects relative to the PAHs alone (Gell et al.,2011).

These reactions are controlled by the particle size of the solid-phase fossil fuels (Kwon & Castaldi, 20o9).

However，VOCs released from biochar are known to possess stimulatory or inhibitory effects on plant productivity (Deenik et al.，2010) and microbial processes (Graber et al.,201O; Khodadad et al.,2011).For example, Spokas (201O) reported the production of ethylene at varying rates from different biochars that might be involved in plant and soil microbial responses to biochar additions and may also act as a nitrification inhibitor (McCarty & Bremner,1991).Furthermore,humans can be exposed to biochar-associated PAHs either directly through inhalation of particles or indirectly through the ingestion of fruits/vegetables grown in biochar-amended soil. Such exposure can pose a significant threat to human health due to the toxic,mutagenic,and carcinogenic effects of PAHs (Chen &Liao,2006).Additionally，both PAHs and VOCs can have bactericidal properties that would adversely affect the structure of soil microbial community (Ward et al.,1997).This could also partly explain the lack of any substantial changes in the soil microbial biomass carbon and activity after biochar amendment (Van Zwieten et al.，2Oo9;Yoo & Kang, 2011).

This review critically analyzes the findings of previous studies characterizing the PAHs and VOCs in biochar samples while delineating the research gaps requiring further investigation.

Spokaset al.(2011) studied VOCs in biochar using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with headspace desorption at $1 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m i n }$ .They detected 140 compounds (with molecular weights below $\\mathrm { 1 0 0 ~ D a } ,$ ）in over 70biochars produced from different feedstocks and pyrolytic conditions.Clough et al.(201o) also confirmed the presence of VOCs in biochar using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) and GC-MS methods.More recently,Buss et al. (2015) used a semiquantitative comparison against the spectra library for the detection of VOCs in biochar. Although headspace instrumentation has been reported asan ideal tool for the determination of sorbed VOCs (Bernardo et al.，2010; Spokas et al.，2011)，current methodologies are not reliable enough for quantitative estimation of VOCs in biochar.Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometric techniques，such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), have also been adapted for direct molecular characterization of biochar materials (Podgorski et al.,2012).Cole et al. (2012）applied laser desorption ionization (LDI) and negative electrospray ionization $\\left[ \\left( - \\right) \\right.$ ESI] for characterization ofVOCs inbiochar.In thecase ofPAHs in biochar，simple approaches for quantitative extraction, separation,and detection have been presented by Hilber et al.

(2013).However，both groups stressed the necessity for a more standardized protocol for quantitative analysis of PAHs in biochar, which should be a prerequisite for biochar quality control and risk assessment.

The sieved samples are generally stored in a dry place at room temperature.Prior to extraction，the sample is thoroughly mixed and an aliquot is used to determine the dry weight of the biochar. Extraction of PAHs is carried out using either a Soxhlet extraction method or an accelerated solvent extraction method.The method of extraction and the choice of solvent are crucial parameters for quantification of carbonized materials because hydrophobic contaminants are tightly bound to the aromatic matrix (Jonker & Koelmans,2002).Both toluene and dichloromethane are common solvents used for extraction of PAHs in biochar (Freddo et al.,2012;Hilber et al.，2012),but the best extraction results have been reported using the Soxhlet extraction method for $3 6 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ with $100 \\%$ toluene as a solvent (Hilber et al., 2012).However, this finding was later contradicted by Cole et al. (2012) and Fabbri et al. (2013),who reported that toluene offered a decent level of efficiency only for the extraction of carbonaceous materials (sp2-hybridized 2D carbons materials)，whereas in the case of LMW PAHs (particularly naphthalene)，a far better extraction efficiency was obtained using acetone/cyclohexane than with $100 \\%$ toluene (Fabbri et al.，2013). Cole et al.(2012) used a mixture of water and methanol to extract hydrophilic polar compounds，particularly those originating from pyrolyzed cellulose or hemicellulose.After extraction，the extracts are concentrated and cleaned by liquid-liquid partitioning over silica gel， for example using dimethylformamide/Milli-Q water $( 9 : 1 , \\mathrm { v / v } )$ ： ",

However,optimization of the solid-phase microextraction (SPME） method for analysis of VOCs in a range of matrices by Higashikawa et al. (2013） showed good performance for soils but poor efficiency for biochar. The strong sorption capacity of biochar markedly reduced the efficiency of SPME.As mentioned above,the extraction efficiency of VOCs from biochar is known to be a function of the target compound and the biochar (Raguso & Pellmyr, 1998)and even biochar produced using the same feedstock and pyrolysis procedures possesses diverse level of VOCs (Spokas et al.,2012). Therefore,further refinement of the analytical techniques is essential before accurate quantification can be achieved by headspace technology. In conclusion,purpose-driven VOCs/PAHs detection methods are on demand. For regulatory purpose (for the biochar to meet sub-ppm requirement), rigorous extraction methods are necessary to determine the total PAHs/VOCs content of biochar.Different analytical methods should then be applied to assess the bioavailability and environmental behavior of persistent contaminants under environmentally relevant conditions.

For example,Fabbri et al.(2013) tested the accuracy of a method developed for quantification of PAHs in biochar on a soil matrix.A natural soil containing 15 PAHs with concentrations ranging from 1.14 to $1 2 . 9 ~ \\mathrm { m g ~ k g ^ { - 1 } }$ was used together with an internal reference biochar sample (industrial-scale slow pyrolysis orchard prunings biochar).The reference biochar was homogenized and mixed with an agricultural soil (dried and sieved $2 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ,$ ata $1 . 1 6 \\%$ (w/w) amendment level.

(2012) in a study determining the effect of biochar addition on mineralization and leaching of PAH after rainfall. Their data showed that PAH concentrations measured 3 years after the addition of biocharwere significantly higher than those of unamended soils. These results suggested that biochar might act as a source of PAH in soil. In a stark contrast to their original hypothesis,biochar was found to increase the leaching of PAH through soils.This was ascribed to the release of significant amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) following the application of fresh biochar to soil. Dissolved organic carbon, togetherwith dust particles from biochar，binds PAHs and facilitates their leaching through soil.Nonetheless,the levels of PAHs in soils were well within the maximum acceptable limits of $5 -$ $5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { g } } ~ { \\mathrm { g } } ^ { - 1 } ,$ as reported previously by Carlon (2007).

A number of studies reported an initial noxious effect on plants (Gell et al.,2011) or microbial communities when certain biochars were applied to soil (Dempster et al., 2012).Moreover,the transient release of inhibitory or toxic compounds from biochar has been postulated as a mechanism contributing to the reduction in greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions (e.g.,nitrous oxide) from soil. In this regard, Spokas and Reicosky (2009) were the first to report that the release of organic compounds from biochar inhibits soil microbial processes (generation of GHG).

Nonetheless，some biochars do have levels of sorbed PAHs (Keiluweit et al., 2012;Kloss et al.，2012;Fabbri et al.，2013)that exceed existing guidelines for land application of commercial biochar (Hilber et al.,2012).Therefore,the development ofanalytical procedures for the quantitative determination of PAHs in biochar and biochar-amended soils is critical.

The presence of oxygen during pyrolysis also led to a reduction in sorbed VOCs.In addition，a recently developed pyrolysis process utilizing $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ asa reaction medium provided a potential option to control the PAH and VOC content in biochar.Several studies experimentally showed that $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ enhanced thermal cracking and blocked the pathway to formation of PAHs,which led to a significant reduction in condensable pyrolytic oil (Kwon et al.，2012，2013，2015；Cho et al.，2015a,b).However，some of these observations need to be validated using a wide array of feedstocks and biochar manufacturing conditions.

In addition,efforts to unravel the key mechanisms driving the sequestration vs. emission of these compounds are greatly desirable to formulate recommendations for future soil management practices. The use of biochar has been suggested as a possible strategy to combat the ever-increasing percentage of carbon in the earth's atmosphere.However,relatively little is known about the impacts of biochar addition on long-term persistence of PAH and VOC or its bioavailability. As sorption is a key process in determining the fate of PAHs or VOCs in soil,an improved understanding of the sorption characteristics of biochar in a broad range of soil environments (agricultural soil, contaminated soil, reclaimed systems,etc.）will provide valuable information on the regulation of PAHs after treatmentwith biochar.In this context,it is desirable to accurately assess the dynamic interactions between sorbent (biochar） and soil microbes and how these processes ultimately affect the cycling of PAHs in the soil layer and their persistence in the environment. In addition,the bioaccumulation of PAH grown in biocharamended soils requires further investigation. Likewise, the variability of VOC composition accompanying the application of biochar also calls for their characterization before and after application to precisely assess their potential effects of biochar application on the agro-ecosystem.Recent reports suggest that the co-occurrence of low molecular weight (LMW) VOCs with PAHs in biochar is more phytotoxic than the presence of PAHs alone. Consequently, they recommended that VOC content in biochar should be included in quality assessment of biochar. ",
