However, the functional role of Calstabin2 in the cognitive function remains unclear. Herein, we used a mouse model of genetic deletion ofCalstabin2 to investigate the function ofCalstabin2 in cognitive dysfunction.We found that Calstabin2 knockout (KO) mice showed significantly reduced performance in Morris Water Maze (MWM), long-term memory(LTM)contextual fear testing,and rotarod test when compared to wild type (WT)littermates. Indeed,genetic deletion of Calstabin2 reduced long-term potentiation (LTP)at the hippocampalCA3-CA1 connection, increased membrane excitability,and induced RyR2 leak.Finaly,we demonstrated thatthe increase incytoplasmiccalcium activated $\\mathsf { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ dependent potassium currents and led to neuronal apoptosis in KO hippocampal neurons.Thus, these results suggest that neuronal RyR2 $\\mathsf { C a } ^ { 2 + }$ leak due to Calstabin2 deletion contributes to learning deficiency and memory impairment.
