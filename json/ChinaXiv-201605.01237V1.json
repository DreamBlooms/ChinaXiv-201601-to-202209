Then,what leads to the alteration of ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ release properties in eNOS overexpressing cells? Previous studies suggested that the regulation of SERCA alters ER ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ load [22]. Thus,we wondered whether the over-activation of SERCA could also achieve this effect. In the presence of $2 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ thapsigargin (TG),an inhibitor of SERCA, the cells were stimulated by $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ ATP to make sure the complete depletion of ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ store. ER $C a ^ { 2 + }$ load was calculated as the integration of the normalized fluorescence value to time (Fig.4A).As shown in Fig.4B and C,compared to the control cells, the ER ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ load was significantly increased in both Cyto-eNOS and ",

Yet in the inflammatory responses there is a great increase in the eNOS activity which is mediated by the dissociation of eNOS from caveolin-1[24].However,whether this change influences ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ signaling is still confused.In the present study,we have overexpressed eNOS in ERand cytosol,respectively,to explore the crosstalk between ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ and NO.We did not find any ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ activity in the basal level.However, $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ ATP induced ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ oscillation was dramatically augmented in the eNOS overexpressing cells (Fig.2).

        "text": "Since there is no ryanodine receptors (RYRs) expression in HeLa cells[27,28],we believe that the enhanced ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ oscillation induced by NO is mediated by IP3 receptors.There are three isoforms of $\\mathrm { I P } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { R } ,$ namely $\\mathrm { I P } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { R } 1$ 1 $\\mathrm { I P } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { R } 2$ 中 $\\mathrm { I P } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { R } 3$ ,with different tissue distribution. Type1and type 3 $\\mathrm { I P } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { R }$ have been thought to be important for the generation of $C a ^ { 2 + }$ oscillations in HeLa cells [27],which was mainly attributed to the calcium release form intracellular stores but not extracellular matrix [29]. However,we found that $\\phantom { + } \\mathrm { I P } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { R } 1$ and $ { \\mathrm { I P } } _ { 3 }  { \\mathrm { R } } 3$ expression was not altered in the eNOS overexpressing cells (Fig.3B). Enhanced ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ re-uptake efficiency indicates that overactive SERCA is involved in the modulation of ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ oscillation. Despite SERCA2 expression level was not changed,the phosphorylation level of PLB(Ser-16) was greatly up-regulated in the eNOS overexpressing cells (Fig.3A),which suggests that the inhibitory status of SERCA is partly removed and this is mediated by NOcGMP-PKG pathway considering that the serine 16 site of PLB is phosphorylated by PKG or PKA [19,2O].Overactive SERCA facilitates $C a ^ { 2 + }$ re-uptake during the IP3 induced ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ release followed by the increase in the frequency and amplitude of ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ oscillation. On the contrary,inhibition of SERCA totally diminished the eATP induced ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ oscillation (Fig. 4A).Previous study showed that increase in the SERCA activity by removing the influence of PLB leads to the increase of ER ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ load in the diabetic heart [3O]. Consistently,we found that ER ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ load was much higher in the eNOS overexpressing cells,which further explains the enhancement of ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ oscillation in those cells.Furthermore,we noted that the EReNOS cells displayed much higher amplitude of ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ oscillation and ER ${ \\mathsf { C a } } ^ { 2 + }$ load compared to the Cyto-eNOS cells.This could be partly interpreted by the different spatial distance between SERCA and eNOS in the two types of cells.Although NO is considered as a diffusible signal molecule [31,32], the extent of the influenced area can be greatly changed by NOS location [33-35].
