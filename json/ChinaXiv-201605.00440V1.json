Here,we describe a previously uncharacterized laccase from Populus,encoded by locus Potri.008Go64ooo,whose reduced expression resulted in transgenic Populus trees with changes in syringyl/guaiacyl ratios as wellas altered sugar release phenotypes.These phenotypes are consistent with plant biomass exhibiting reduced recalcitrance.Interestingly,the transgene effect on recalcitrance is dependent on a mild pretreatment prior to chemical extraction of sugars. Metabolite profiling suggests the transgene modulates phenolics that are associated with the cell wall structure.We propose that this particular laccase has a range of functions related to oxidation of phenolics and conjugation of flavonoids that interact with lignin in the cell wall.

        "text": "The ability to break down plant cell wals is a key factor limiting the extraction of sugars that can be utilized for the production of ethanol during biomass fermentation for biofuel production. Plant cell wall resistance to digestion，that is recalcitrance，is governed by the inherent chemical composition and interpolymer interactions of the cell wall consisting of lignin,cellulose and hemicellulose． Cell wall composition and interaction of key polymersduring biomass fermentation have been previously reviewed (Carpita,2012;Loque et al.，2015). Currently,expensive pretreatments using high temperatures,harsh corrosives and enzymes are utilized to increase the extractability of sugars stored in cell wals (Blanch,2012; Chundawat et al.,2011). Finding ways to alter cell wall composition or structure and reduce the severity ofpretreatments isa key goal in developing cost-effective biomass feedstocks for biofuel and bioproduct production.The ability to genetically modify biomass feedstocks can have a direct impact on the ability to extract sugars and therefore yield of transportation fuels from plant biomass.ldentifying genes that regulate cell wall biosynthesis and composition and reduce recalcitrance isa critical step for efficient production of products from lignocellulosic biomass.

        "text": "One major component of secondary cell walls that directly affects recalcitrance and prevents easy extraction of sugars is lignin (Chen and Dixon，2oo7). Lignin is a polyphenolic heteromorphic polymer found in cell walls that adds structural support for cell walls and is created through the polymerization of the monolignols coniferyl alcohol, $p$ -coumaryl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol that form the guaiacyl (G)，hydroxyl-coumaryl (H)and syringyl (S) subunits,respectively.The formation of lignin polymers and the regulation of which subunits are utilized in lignin molecules is,however,still not well understood.It is known that increased quantity of lignin in cell walls reduces the saccharification of the cell walls and limits the access to primary carbohydrates，that is cellulose and hemicellulose (Chen and Dixon，2oo7).Additionally, lignin subunit composition can also influence ruminant digestibility (Akin et al.,1986). Cell walls from different plant species,and even from different tissues from the same plant,can vary in their monolignol subunit composition.For example，gymnosperms typically have abundant G and low H subunits,while dicots contain mostly G and S subunits (Weng and Chapple,2010).Syringyl to guaiacyl $\\left( { \\mathsf { S } } / { \\mathsf { G } } \\right)$ ratio,in particular, is an important quality with a higher presence of S subunits making sugars more amenable to extraction (Studer et al.，2011).In addition，interaction of sugars with lignin has been shown to affect digestibility of biomass.Higher hemicellulose levels were shown to increase saccharification likely by interlinkingwith lignin to reduce lignocellulosic crystallinity,as were shown in Miscanthus (Si etal.,2015;Xu et al.,2012).While utilizing biomasswith properties amenable to deconstruction and access to sugars, targeting genes to modulate the properties of lignin and its associations has been difficult due to the lack of understanding how plant cells regulate lignin polymerization and interpolymer interfaces.

Although they share significant homology， laccases appear to have functionally diverged within and between phylogenetic clades (Dittmer et al.,2oo4).Bacterial, fungal and insect laccases have been shown to function in the degradation of lignin, whereas higher plant laccases are thought to function in the polymerization of lignin subunits (Sharma and Kuhad，2008). Additionally，even though laccases retained similar protein domains,molecular modelling suggests differences in protein folding and affinity for interacting with lignin,which may result in divergence of activity in lignin synthesis and degradation (Awasthi et al.，2o15). Laccases are known to function in oxidation reactions involvingvarious inorganic and organic substrates including phenolics and aromatic amines in plants.Studies in Populusand Arabidopsissuggest that laccasesactnotonly in the biosynthesis of lignin but also may contribute to additional roles of cell wall chemistry or integrity (Ranocha et al.,2oo2;Ranocha et al.，1999;Zhao et al.，2013). In plants,it was thought that laccases may be involved in lignin biosynthesis based on their capability to oxidize lignin precursors and their localization in lignifying tissues (Bao etal.,1993;Driouich etal.，1992;Ranocha etal.,1999; Sterjiades et al.,1992).For example,over-expression of the cotton laccase,GaLACCASE 1 (LAC1),in Populus leads to increased lignin content with transgenic plants showing a $2 . 1 \\% -$ $1 9 . 6 \\%$ increase in total lignin，indicating that laccasesare involved in lignin biosynthesis (Wang et al.,2oo8).In Arabidopsis, insertional mutations in three laccase-encoding genes completely abolished lignin accumulation (Zhao et al.，2013). Interestingly, the three laccases,AtLAC4,11 and 17,are not paralogous and show homology to different subfamilies of the laccase gene family,suggesting that lignin biosynthesis is not controlled by a single subfamily.A study in Populus indicated that transgenic trees，in which expression of the laccase gene PtLAC3 was reduced,showed a threefold increase in phenolic content which accumulated in xylem ray parenchyma cells (Ranocha et al., 2002).In addition,xylem fibre cell walls were dramatically altered leading to severe deformation，indicating a defect in cell wall integrity and supporting the importance of this laccase in normal xylem cell wall structure and integrity (Ranocha et al.，2002). However,there was no significant change in lignin quantity or composition.Most laccases,especially in Populus,have yet to be studied, leaving numerous questions unanswered regarding the specific role individual laccases play in lignin biosynthesis or cell wall development.

However,with no pretreatment,control lines generally showed a greater release of glucose and xylose with the exception of PdLAC2-1.This discrepancy in saccharification of PdLAC2 RNAi lines compared to controls using the LHW pretreatment vs the un-pretreated conditions could be attributed to a difference in the manner in which ligninis interacting with the polysaccharides in the cell wall of the PdLAC2 RNAi lines.That is,there may be structural differences within the cell walls that require some thermal or chemical incubation leading to perturbed recalcitrance with a mild pretreatment.

Interestingly， the knock-down transgenic trees also showed an increase in above-ground biomass compared to controls.It is not clear why reducing the expression of this laccase Would result in increased biomass.One possibility for this phenotype could be attributed to a loosening of the cell wall leading to elongated cells and increased growth as was seen in silencing of GALACTURONOSYLTRANSFERASE 4（GAUT4)in tomato (de Godoy etal.，2013)and in GAUT12 in Populus (Biswal et al.,2015). In contrast,Arabidopsis mutants with loss of function for both laccases AtLAC4 and AtLAC17 showed a conditional semi-dwarf phenotype (Berthet,2011).Additionally, AtLAC2 deficient plants show a reduced root elongation developmental defect under stress growth conditions (Cai et al., 2006)． However，in previous reports，knock-down of other Populus laccases PtLAC3，PtLAC90 and PtLAC110 hadno reported developmental growth defects (Ranocha et al.，2002). The precise connection of laccase function and regulation with changes in increased biomass remains unclear although this also reflects the potential divergence of LAC gene functionalization and merits further investigation.

        "text": "The observed reduction in recalcitrance of PdLAC2 RNAi lines was dependent upon sample pretreatment and not explained by an initial higher quantity of soluble sugars.This discrepancy may point to altered structural components within the PdLAC2 RNAi plant cell walls without a reduction in lignin content.It is possible these putative extra-structural components provide novel structuresand that maintains cell wall recalcitrance in the absence of thermal or chemical pretreatment.Thus,upon LHW pretreatment, these extra-structural components foster reduced recalcitrance.Our results suggest that PdLAC2 is likely involved in higher order interactions of cell wall components.As we only observed an increase in sugar release in knock-down transgenic lines when samples were subjected to a relatively mild pretreatment condition (Figure 6),we believe the major components of the cell wall have not been disrupted.This can be seen with unchanged total lignin content as well as similar quantities of major sugar components derived through glycosyl composition analysis (FigureS4).However，when energy is added to the PdLAC2 transgenic samples,through hot water pretreatment,we see a significant increase in sugar release，suggesting that cell wall components are less associated and more amenable to deconstruction.The reduced interactions we postulate occur in the transgenic knock-down lines would also be consistent with our proposed 'loosening'of the cell wall allowing for an increase in biomass in these lines.The increased accumulation of phenolics we observed based on metabolomics analysis may represent the key interfaces of the cell wall components that are regulated by PdLAC2.Further investigation into the role of additional laccases and specifically this laccase with respect to biochemical enzymatic activities should yield a continued understanding of elaborate mechanisms regulating cell wall construction.The PdLAC2 RNAi lines also showed an increase in galactopyranosyl glycerols that mayindicate reduced linkages to cell membranes. These accumulations，and those related to salicortin metabolism and hydroxycinnamoyl glycoside conjugate production，suggest a degree of carbon diversion to soluble defence rather than structural (cell wall) components. In non-pretreated biomass,an increase in phenolic glucosides may prevent extraction of sugars, and under mild LHW pretreatment,phenolics may be solubilized thus allowing greater access to sugars in the cell wall residue of the transgenic plant biomass.

        "text": "The presence of expanded laccases in plant genomes advocates for divergence of functions in this gene family.As noted above, PdLAC2 may be involved in many oxidative reactions，likely involved in these phenolics and possibly downstream reactions linking lignin to other structural cell wall components or simply catalysing the conjugation of flavonoids themselves.The largest metabolite fold change was a late-eluting coumaroyl rhamnosylglucoside(e.g.rutinose orneohesperidose) conjugate.This accumulation may be an example of the latter,rather than being the result of an unassembled polymer linking component. Such classes of accumulating phenolics，including flavonoidsand caffeoylshikimates,are also indicative of altered carbon flux to nonlignin components in the case of the former and upstream storage metabolites associated with the lignin pathway in the caseof the latter.Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that the paralog of PdLAC2，PtLAC3 was shown to be involved in the accumulation of phenolics in xylem tissues (Ranocha et al.,2oo2). It should be noted that reduced expression of PdLAC2 had a significant impact on S/G lignin ratio that was not seen in knock-down lines of PtLAC3,indicating potential functional divergence between these paralogs.Although speculative,another possibility to explain the selective accumulation of partially identified flavonoids [retention time 16.12 min leucocyanidin-like $( + \\ m / z \\ 6 4 8 \\ 5 5 9 )$ and16.30 min m/z 369 flavonoid glycosidel is that the laccase may play a role in their complexation into the wall,much like the incorporation of tricin into the lignin in cell walls of some monocot species (Lan et al.,2015). However, suchan analogous flavonoid integration into lignin in a woody dicot species has yet to be demonstrated. ",

There also is the favourable balanced benefit of the use of biomass pretreatment prior to saccharification.While strongacids and other enzymatic pretreatments may allow extraction of more sugars,the negative cost of inputs is a concern.Mild pretreatment strategies,suchas LHW,showa greaterextraction of sugars even in biomass that may not release as much sugars with no pretreatments. Our results with PdLAC2 down-regulation suggest that mild pretreatments increase sugar release and could result in reduction in the cost of lignocellulosic biofuel production. ",
