Methods A total of 127 patients with non-disseminated NPC were recruited between January,2009andDecember,2013at Nanfang Hospital.Thepretreatmentserumglobulin levels wereanalyzed withthe receiver-operatingcharacteristic (ROC)curveanalysis toselectthe cut-offpointforlowand high pretreatment serumglobulin levels.

Currently the prognosis of NPC patients is evaluated based primarily on the Union Internationale Contrele Cancer/American Joint Cancer Committee (UICC/AJCC) TNM staging system. However, there is a discrepancy between the actual clinical outcome and anatomically based TNM stage，indicating that the clinical staging is insufficient for precise prediction of the prognosis . Cancer progression and survival are not determined solely based on the local characteristics of tumor,such as TNM stage,but also involves the host systemic immune/inflammatory response [2].

Second, Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection is associated with NPC in the areas where NPC is endemic，and inducesa consistent expression of viral immunogenic proteins that leads to a potent immuneresponse24.25] EBV-encodedRNAs (EBs) cause chronic inflammation,and play a pivotal role in inflammation-to-oncogenesis transition in NPC development [26.27]。Finally，high levelsofnumerous cytokines and other inflammation-related factorsare consistently detected in the peripheral blood of patients with NPC [24].

Cancer-related inflammation representsa target for innovative therapeutic strategies.For many years,all efforts to treat cancer have focused on the destruction/ inhibition of tumor cells. Strategies to modulate the host microenvironment offer a complementary perspective. Primary proinflammatory cytokines represent the prime targets and ongoing results in this direction justify continuing eforts28.29Anti-inflammatorytherapyin variety of cancers has become a research hotspot. Several anti-inflammatory drugs have been found to reduce tumor incidence when used as prophylactics,and can slow down progression and reduce mortality when used as therapeutics,particularly in the case of sporadic colon cancer [30l. Such drugs include COX2 inhibitors, aspirin, andanti-inflammatorysteroids(suchas dexamethasone).In addition to itswell-documented preventive effects in colon cancer,aspirin also reduces the incidence of breast cancer 31] and lowers the risk of prostate cancer in individuals that carry a particular polymorphic allele at the lymphotoxin a locus,which specifes high lymphotoxin production[32].Recently，it has been reported that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,but not aspirin,are associated with a reduction intherisk of bladdercancer [33] andurothelial carcinoma [341.The value of anti-inflammatory therapy in NPC needs to be explored further.
