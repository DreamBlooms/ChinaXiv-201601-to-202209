Shetty et al.[13] proposed a tactical routing problem of a team of UAVs to conduct attacking mission based on the priorities of targets,where the UAV can carry ammunition to attack different targets. Ceccarelli et al. [14] investigated a micro UAV routing problem for reconnaissance and carried on the simulation experiments for finding the robust solution in the presence of randomly perturbed wind.Mufalli et al.[15] considered the simultaneous sensors selection and routing ofUAVs where the loads are the influencing factors of endurance range and a new mathematical model is constructed to solve the problem.Avellar et al. [16] routed a group of UAVs for area coverage to optimize the minimum coverage time,where intelligence collection can be carried out in the fixed area and the specified time windows of targets are taken into consideration.Evers et al.[17] studied the routing problem of multiple UAVs for reconnaissance mission, taking the uncertainty in the fuel usage into account. Mahmud and Cho [18] investigated the UAV routing problem where UAVs need to avoid being predicted by the enemy，and Vanegas et al.[19] considered the routing problem of UAVs in the environmental uncertainty.In civilian application,UAVs can be used for logistics delivery [2O],medical material transportation [21],efficient road detection and tracking [22] and disaster relief operations [23]. Kevin et al. [24] investigated the vehicle routing problem for drone delivery scenarios which minimizes both the cost and the overall delivery time considering an energy consumption model. Sawadsitang et al. [25] proposed the joint ground and aerial delivery service optimizationandplanningframeworkconsideringthe uncertainty of drone package delivery. To solve the problem, they formulated a three-stage stochastic integer programming model with a decomposition method.In the work [26],the UAVs were used for dynamic wildfire tracking since the UAVs can work in hazardous fire tracking instead of humans,and a distributed control framework was proposed for the UAV team.

[6] and Luo et al. [2O] proposed a novel two-echelon ground vehicle （GV） and UAV cooperated routing problem (2E-GUCRP) for ISR missions,where the GV serves as the mobile platform carrying the UAVs and recharging the UAV's battery.In this new mode, UAV can enlarge its endurance range through multiple starting on the GVs.In recently years,the application of UAVs in the civilian operation is drawing increasing attention,many commercial logistic companies used UAVs for the ‘last-mile-delivery’ to save the cost for logistic distribution.Chiang et al. [27] proposed a GV and UAV cooperated system where GVs are the mobile platform for UAVs to start and land on,and both of them can deliver the packages during the route. To overcome the limited endurance range of the small UAVs， Sungwoo and Ilkyeong [28] investigated a truck-drone system,where a fixed drone station is built to collect drones and recharging equipments, and a truck is employed to connect the station and the logistics distribution center. Liu et al. [29] designed a Simulated Annealing algorithm (SA) to solve the 2E-GUCRP problem for package delivery.In these studies,with the assistance of ground vehicles the endurance range of UAV is effectively extended. However, UAV can only visit targets which are restricted by the path of GV. To extend the endurance range and release the UAV's dependence on GV, Coelho et al. [3O] designed a two-level routing problem model, where the UAV can be recharged at a given recharging station to complete the tour. Li et al. [31] proposed a mission planning method which considered both the routing of UAVs and recharging stations location,and assumed the recharging procedure takes a fixed time. Ribeiro et al. [32] studied the application of UAVs for belt conveyor inspection system in the mining industry where UAVs are restricted to be fully charged at the recharging station. To extend the UAV mission coverage, Noureddine et al. [33] utilized the public land transport vehicle carrying the UAV during part of its route for saving the energy consumption, and the recharging power is set to a fixed parameter. Yu et al.

Fig.1 presents an illustrative example of the problem. The different battery icons denote the power level of the UAV's battery after visiting each target.The UAV start from the unique basewitha fully charged battery,and after visiting target T3, the battery power cannot support it to visit the next target T4, and therefore the UAV finds the nearby recharging platform P2 for recharging its battery partially.After recharging,the UAV continues its tour for visiting T4 and T5,and then flies back to the base.

        "text": "From Fig. 6(a),it can be observed that the number of UAVs decreases sharply with the increase of battery capacity in URP and comparatively decreases gently in URP-RC. When the battery capacity is 120, the deviation of the number ofUAVs between URP-RC and URP reaches 3O which verifies that URP-RC can significantly reduce the fixed cost of UAVs especially for the small UAVs with short endurance range.With the increase ofbattery capacity, the deviation between URP-RC and URP becomes small and reaches O when the capacity is 300. That is because the UAVs can complete the task without recharging when the battery capacity is large enough.Similarly, the results in Fig.6(b) showed that the overall mission time decreases as the battery capacity increases,and becomes the same for both URP-RC and URP when the battery capacity is large enough. Since the targets have specific time windows in both URP-RC and URP,when the UAV arrives earlier than the earliest reconnaissance start time,ithas to wait for some time. Therefore,the relatively deviation of the overall mission time betweenURP-RCandURPis smaller than thatfor thenumber of UAVs in Fig. 6(a). ",
