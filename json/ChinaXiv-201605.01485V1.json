The authors then performed extensive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on the synthetic model in the $S _ { 2 }$ state.The two signals in the EPR spectrum,one with $g = 4 . 9$ and one with $g = 2 . 0 ,$ are similar to those from the native OEC in the $S _ { 2 }$ state.[9,10] Such characteristicsignals have never been observed in other synthetic models.Additionally, the ligands at the Mn4 and Ca positions could be exchanged by alternative neutral ligands,which indicated that they are possible binding sites for the water molecule.The resemblance between the synthetic $\\mathsf { M n } _ { 4 } \\mathsf { C a }$ cluster and the native OEC suggests that this synthetic model is a good starting point to study the mechanism of the watersplitting reaction in great depth.With the structural and spectroscopic resemblances,a natural question to ask iswhether the synthetic model could perform water-oxidation chemistry.
