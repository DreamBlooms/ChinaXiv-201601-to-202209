However, it is technically challenging and time-consuming to build multi-row arrays due to complex coupling issues. This paper presents a novel and simple method for closely spaced multi-row RF array designs. Induced current elimination decoupling method has shown the capability of reducing coupling between microstrip elements from different rows.In this study,its capability for decoupling array elements from the same row was investigated and validated by bench tests,with an isolation improvement from $- 8 . 9$ to $- 2 0 . 7$ dB.Based on this feature,a closely spaced double-row microstrip array with 16 elements was built at 7 T. $S _ { 2 1 }$ between any two elements of the 16-channel closely spaced double-row microstrip array was better than $- 1 4$ dB.In addition,its feasibility and performance Was validated by MRI experiments.No significant image reconstruction-related noise amplifications were observed for parallel imaging even when reduced factor $( R )$ achieves 4. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed design might be a simple and efficient approach in fabricating closely spaced multi-row RF arrays. ",

However,at the frequency of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { M H z }$ (Larmor frequency of proton at $7 ~ \\mathrm { T }$ ）or higher， the wavelength in biological tissue is significantly shortened [4-6]. Therefore,it is technically challenging to design large-sized radiofrequency (RF) coil.A variety of RF array coils have been developed in UHF MRI,including traditional L/C loop coil [7-10], microstrip coil [11-18],and radiative coil [19-21]. Due to its simple structure and low radiation loss,microstrip technique has been a popular choice in designing RF array in UHF MRI. ",

        "text": "Recently，a multi-row microstrip array using induced current elimination (ICE)/magnetic wall decoupling was proposed and realized at $7 \\mathrm { T }$ [22]. In the ICE-decoupled multi-row array,a“figure of $8 ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ -shaped resonator (referred to as the decoupling element) was used to suppress the EM coupling from adjacent elements of different rows.The self-impedance of the decoupling element $( X _ { \\mathrm { d d } } )$ was adjusted to meet the decoupling condition: $X _ { \\mathrm { d d } } = X _ { \\mathrm { c d } } ^ { 2 } / X _ { \\mathrm { c c } }$ ,where $X _ { \\mathrm { c d } }$ is mutual impedance of coil element and decoupling element and $X _ { \\mathrm { c c } }$ is the self-impedance of adjacent elements from different rows.It has been demonstrated that the decoupling element acts like a “magnetic wall” and exhibits a “shielding effect” [23，24]. This shielding effect might also be beneficial to reduce the coupling between adjacent elements from the same row. In other words, the self-impedance of the decoupling element $( X _ { \\mathrm { d d } } )$ ，which is intended to meet the decoupling condition of coil elements from adjacent rows,might also meet the decoupling condition of adjacent elements from the same row to a certain degree.

        "text": "It has previously been shown that multi-row transceiver arrays exhibit the capability ofRF shimming and pTx along z-direction [35,36], which is beneficial in providing more uniform transmit field.Due to the limitation of our RF interface, two rows of the 16-channel array cannot be excited simultaneously. Therefore,3D RF shimming capability of the 16-channel array was not shown in this work. However, based on the S-parameter and MR imaging results,we believe this double-row closely spaced transceiver array could be an efficient tool to perform 3D RF shimming or pTx. ",
