They were able to distinguish three sequences according to the chemical shifts of protons in $\\scriptstyle - \\mathbf { O C H } _ { 2 ^ { - } }$ ：unit due to the conjugation effect resulting from the aromatic furan ring. The number-average unit length as well as the degree of randomness can be calculated accordingly. However,for PBAC copolymer,the third monomer is the nonplanar aliphatic ring structure CHDA,which does not show conjugation effect like the aromatic furan ring.3,34 Therefore, there is only one single peak for protons in ${ \\bf - O C H } _ { 2 } -$ unit in all possible sequences (CBC,ABA and ABC),locating at $\\delta = 4 . 0 9$ ppm (c).2,23 Consequently， the sequence， number-average length of PBC and PBA unit as well as the degree of randomness are unable to determine from $^ 1 \\mathrm { H }$ NMR results.We then turned to $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ NMR spectra and found that for all PBAC copolymers,only PBAC-50 shows distinguishable peaks in the range of 173.0 to $1 7 5 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { p p m }$ (Fig. $\\mathbf { S 1 \\dag }$ ),which could be assigned to different sequences in the PBAC copolymer (see ESI for detailed analysist).The calculated number-average lengths for PBA and PBC units in PBAC-50 are 1.62 and 2.24,respectively. The degree of randomness is 1.06, which is very close to 1, suggesting that this copolymeris a random copolymer (Table $^ { S 2 \\dagger } .$ ).Thisresult further implies that for the series of PBAC samples obtained in this work,with the increase of PBC amount，the numberaverage length for PBC will be greater than 2.24,while that of PBA will be smaller than1.62.34 Asa result, the influence of PBA unit on the chemical shift of carbonyl carbon in PBC unit becomes negligible.Therefore,it is unable to tell the differences among different sequences in the PBAC copolymers in the $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ NMR spectra when PBC amount is higher than $5 0 \\%$ .Nevertheless,it is reasonable to conclude that PBAC samples are random copolymers and the number-average length of PBC unit is longer than that of PBA unit.
