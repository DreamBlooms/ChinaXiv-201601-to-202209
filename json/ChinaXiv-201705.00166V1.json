Unlike the $\\displaystyle \\boldsymbol { \\mathsf { s p } } ^ { 2 }$ bonded graphene,graphyne contains two kinds of bonds, namely sp and $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ . Recently, large graphyne film has been successfully prepared and it exhibits excellent semicon ducting properties.1° It is conceivable that graphyne may be more suitable for thermoelectric applications than metallic graphene.Indeed,more and more attention has been paid to the electronic, thermal and thermoelectric properties of graphyne. With respect to its electronic properties,density functional theory calculations indicated that a band gap is opened in graphyne by the presence of the sp bonding.11-13 Shuai et al. calculated the intrinsic mobility in graphyne using firstprinciples calculations,and it was found that the carrier mobility in graphyne is even larger than that in graphene.14-17 In the aspect of thermal conductivity, Zhang et al.18 have shown,based on their molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,that the thermal conductivity of graphyne is one order of magnitude lower than that of graphene at room temperature. Lu et al.9,19 applied the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach to graphyne, and it was found that the thermal conductance of graphyne is $4 0 \\%$ of that of graphene.By using a similar method, Ouyang et al.20,21 have shown that the thermal conductance of $\\beta -$ and γ-graphyne nanoribbons is $2 6 \\%$ and $4 0 \\%$ of that of graphene nanoribbons,respectively.In the aspect of thermoelectric properties, Wang, Ouyang,21,22 and Sevincli23 predicted that the optimized ZT values of graphyne sheets can be one order higher than that of graphene,mainly owing to the increase of the power factors. Sun et al.24 carried out MD simulations and showed that the lattice thermal conductivity of graphdiyne is $7 . 3 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ m ~ } ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { ~ K ~ } ^ { - 1 }$ at room temperature,resulting in a ZT value of 4.8.

It is known that electron-phonon and phononphonon interactions are not well treated in the NEGF method.25 Some important information,such as the electron or phonon mean free path,can neither be extracted from the calculations. The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) coupled with deformation potential theory (DPT） was applied to calculate the carrier mobility of some carbon materials14-17,26,27 and this method was proved to be suitable for describing the electron-phonon coupling of graphyne.Meanwhile,an exact numerical solution of the phonon BTE has been developed to study the thermal conductivity.This method has been successfully applied in the phonon transport study for two-dimensional materials such as graphene6,28 and $\\mathrm { W S } _ { 2 }$ .29 In this work, we use the BTE method based on first-principles calculations to investigate the electronic, phonon and thermoelectric properties of graphyne.By considering the phonon-phonon scattering，our theoretical calculations find that the thermal conductivity of graphyne is two orders lower than that of graphene,leading to the much higher thermoelectric performance than the previous predictions.

        "text": "As shown in Table 4,our calculations indicate that the two orders lower phonon thermal conductivity in graphyne sheets significantly increases the ZTvalues.The optimized ZTvalue of graphdiyne at room temperature is 0.99 and 3.26 by p-type and n-type doping,respectively.These values mostly exceed the previous reports and make graphyne a very promising candidate for thermoelectric applications.In the previous studies, Wang et al. and Sevincli et al.independently studied the thermoelectric properties of $\\gamma$ graphyne sheets by using the NEGF method within the ballistic approach.They obtained similar results and the optimized $Z T$ value for $\\gamma$ graphyne is only about 0.16 at 300 K.9,23 They attributed the relatively large ZT values of graphyne to larger Seebeck coefficients. The huge difference in the phonon mean free path between graphene and graphyne is neglected by the NEGF method,which leads to overestimated thermal conductivity and underestimated $Z T$ value for graphyne sheets.9,23 Sun et al. investigated the thermoelectric properties of graphdiyne by a combination of the BTE method and MD simulations,and the optimized $Z T$ value for graphdiyne is 4.8 at $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { K } ^ { 2 4 }$ As is known，MD results strongly depend on the empirical potential coefficients.It seems that the thermal conductivity of graphene and graphyne obtained by the MD method isunderestimated compared with experimental values.For example,the MD results show that the lattice thermal conductivity of graphene at $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { K }$ is only $1 0 0 \\mathrm { W } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ 18 which is much smaller than the experimental measurements $\\left( 2 5 0 0 { - } 5 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { W ~ m } ^ { - 1 } \\ \\mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 } \\right)$ .6,7 ",

We note that the $Z T$ value of graphdiyne is higher than 3.O in a very wide temperature range (almost $3 0 0 { - } 9 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { K } )$ and a wide doping range $( n ~ = ~ 0 . 2 – 8 . 0 ~ \\times ~ 1 0 ^ { 1 9 } ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } )$ ，which implies that this graphdiyne is particularly suitable for fabrication of the thermoelectric modules.
