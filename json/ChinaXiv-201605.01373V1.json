Therefore,we have developed NeuroPep,a comprehensive resource of neuropeptides, which holds 5949 non-redundant neuropeptide entries originating from 493 organisms belonging to 65 neuropeptide families.In NeuroPep,the number of neuropeptides in invertebrates and vertebrates is 3455 and 2406,respectively.It is currently the most complete neuropeptide database.We extracted entries deposited in UniProt, the database (www.neuropeptides.nl) and NeuroPedia，and used text mining methods to retrieve entries from the MEDLINE abstracts and full text articles.All the entries in NeuroPep have been manually checked.2069 of the 5949 $( 3 5 \\% )$ ）neuropeptide sequences were collected from the scientific literature.Moreover,NeuroPep contains detailed annotations for each entry,including source organisms,tissue specificity，families,names，posttranslational modifications，3D structures (if available）and literature references. Information derived from these peptide sequences such as amino acid compositions, isoelectric points,molecular weight and other physicochemical properties of peptides are also provided.A quick search feature allows users to search the database with keywords such as sequence, name,family,etc.,and an advanced search page helps users to combine queries with logical operators like AND/OR.In addition,user-friendly web tools like browsing，sequence alignment and mapping are also integrated into the NeuroPep database.

        "text": "Neuropeptides are small proteineous substances that are produced by neurons,released in a regulated fashion,and act on either neural substrates,such as neurons,glial cells or on non-neuronal target cells,such as a gland or muscle (1). It has been shown that different neuropeptides are involved in a number of physiological processes such as food intake, metabolism,stress control,pain perception,social behaviors,learning,memory,etc.(2-5).Neuropeptides are typically 3-1OO amino-acid-residue long, produced from larger precursor molecules by a series of post-translational processing (6).There are two general approaches ('function-first' or ‘peptide-first'） to discover neuropeptides.The function-first approach is based on bioassays,receptor-binding assays and genetic analysis,while the peptide-first approach is based on cDNA cloning of precursor,using neuropeptide precursor processing enzymes,peptidomics,etc.(7).Since the first neuropeptide substance P was discovered by van Euler and Gaddum in 1931 (8) and sequenced in 1971 (9),there has been a tremendous increase in the number of identified neuropeptides over the last 4O years.Furthermore,due to their wide range of roles in health and disease,neuropeptides are considered as attractive therapeutic targets for nervous-system disorders such as depression，anxietyand Parkinson's disease (1O-12). Several databases like EROPMoscow (13), SwePep (14),PeptideDB (15),PepBank (16) have been developed to hold general bioactive peptides. There are also some databases such as APD2 (17),CAMP (18),DAMPD (19),which were designed for specific antimicrobial peptides.However,there are only two recent databases specific for neuropeptides. ",

The NeuroPedia database was mainly designed for identification of neuropeptides using mass spectrometry data (20). It extracted 847 neuropeptide sequences of eight organisms belonging to the phylum Chordata and collected 3401 identified spectra from NIST spectral libraries and their own in-house spectral datasets (2O).Since the two databases were specialized for the authors’study,many invertebrate-specific neuropeptides were not considered such as allatostatins,pyrokinins,crustacean cardioactive peptides, pigment-dispersing factors,etc.,and neither of the databases gave detailed annotations for each neuropeptide sequence.Although the invertebrate neuropeptide characterization lagged behind the vertebrate neuropeptide, there were many new invertebrate neuropeptides that were identified owing to the development of the mass spectrometry technique in recent years (21-23).
