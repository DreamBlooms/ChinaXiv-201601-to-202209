        "text": "Abstract We investigate equilibrium height of a flux rope,and its internal equilibrium in a realistic plasma environment by carrying out numerical simulations of the evolution of systems including a current-carrying flux rope.We find that the equilibrium height of a flux rope is approximately described by a power-law function of the relative strength of the background field. Our simulations indicate that the flux rope can escape more easily from a weaker background field. This further confirms that a catastrophe in the magnetic configuration of interest can be triggered by a decrease in strength of the background field. Our results show that it takes some time to reach internal equilibrium depending on the initial state of the flux rope.The plasma flow inside the flux rope due to the adjustment for the internal equilibrium of the flux rope remains small and does not last very long when the initial state of the flux rope commences from the stable branch of the theoretical equilibrium curve.This work also confirms the influence of the initial radius of the flux rope in its evolution; the results indicate that a flux rope with a larger initial radius erupts more easily. In addition, by using a realistic plasma environment and a much higher resolution in our simulations, we notice some different characteristics compared to previous studies in Forbes. ",

During this process, a large number of magnetized energetic plasmas (with a mass of up to $\\mathrm { 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } ~ g }$ and an energy of $1 0 ^ { 3 2 }$ erg) are ejected into interplanetary space within a short timescale,and hence disturb the spatial and planetary magnetic field and significantly afect satellite operation,aviation equipment and flight paths, human space exploration,communication and so on (Chen et al. 2002; Schwenn 2006; Pulkkinen 2007; Lin 2007; Chen 2011; Mei et al.2012b; Shen et al.2013; Li & Zhang 2O13,and references therein).

        "text": "It is generally believed that two processes are involved in intense solar activities and eruptions. The first one is called the storage phase,in which the magnetic flux transported from the photosphere slowly accumulates in the corona, leading to a gradual increase of magnetic energy in the corona. The timescale of the magnetic storage phase is typically several days,so this phase can be considered as evolving through a series of equilibria in quasi-static processes. When the stored magnetic energy surpasses critical values,the equilibrium willbe broken,and the eruptive phase,i.e.the second process,willoccur.The system in this phase will promptly expand on a dynamic timescale of a few minutes (i.e.in Alfvén time scales)due to the loss of balance.Transition from the quasi-static evolution to the dynamic phase leads to a so-called catastrophe (e.g. Forbes & Isenberg 1991; Isenberg et al.1993; Forbes & Priest 1995; Forbes 1990,2000; Lin& Forbes 2000; Lin et al.2006; Yu 2012, and the references therein).

This decay could be a consequence of the magnetic diffusion that leads to the formation, as well as the eruption of a flux rope (Mackay & van Ballegooijen 2Oo6). Gradually decreasing the background field may also cause the state of the flux rope to transit catastrophically from the old equilibrium to the new one (Forbes & Isenberg 1991; Isenberg et al.1993).Lin et al. (1998)analytically extended this work to include the curvature force that creates an additional outward force,and further realized that, in addition to the impact of the background field,the radius of a flux rope plays an important role in its eruption. However, these results are constrained by the analytical method.Although Wang et al.(2009) and Mei et al.(2Ol2a) numerically investigated the evolution of a flux rope,the initial distribution of plasma density in the background field in their simulations is a bit far from the realistic case.

In this case,the initial state is not in equilibrium.Because the magnetic compression outstrips the magnetic tension,the flux rope begins to rise quickly from the start of the experiment.The closed magnetic field lines become stretched with the lift-off of the flux rope, and the X-type neutral point appears on the boundary surface in the magnetic configuration with time progressing.This magnetic topology means that magnetic reconnection occurs,i.e. there exists magnetic diffusion, which can convert magnetic energy to heating and the kinetic energy of the plasma. In our experiments,although no physical diffusion is included in Equations (1), the results of numerical diffusion are equivalent to the result of physical diffusion (e.g.see the detailed discussions given by Wang et al.2Oo9).Moreover, we can notice in these panels that propagation of the fast shock Occurs,which appears as a crescent feature around the flux rope (Wang et al. 2Oo9 and Mei et al. 2012a).

When the background field is equal to zero $M = 0 . 0 \\AA$ ,the initial repulsive force on the flux rope is large, and the flux rope promptly rises at the beginning. This agrees with the result in Forbes (1990), when $M = 0 . 0$ ，at about $t = 2 . 0 \\mathrm { s }$ the flux rope's speed begins to increase again. However, after about $t ~ = ~ 2 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { s }$ ，our flux rope's trajectory differs from the result of Forbes (199O).Figure 8 in Forbes (1990) shows that at about $t = 2 . 0 \\mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ and $M = 0 . 0$ ,the speed of the flux rope becomes warped. However, this warp is not represented in our simulations. The reasons why we have different results are: 1) this increase could be a numerical artifact of the open boundary conditions; or 2) it is because of the lack of a gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere.In this work,we used the same boundary conditions as Forbes (199O)and considered the gravitationally stratified background solar atmosphere.By comparing our numerical simulations with Forbes (199O),we find that the warp of the height of flux rope may be eliminated by the gravitational stratification effect.The flux rope when $M = 1$ in the work of Forbes (199O) stops at some height after it starts rising at the very beginning,and then moves slightly downward before continuing to rise further. Our results indicate that the gravitationally stratified medium can account for this phenomenon. ",

Instead,the flux rope keeps rising slowly, and stops at some height after some time, then moves downwards slightly before continuing to rise further.   \n(2）Among cases 4-12 (see nine solid points in Figure 2,each point represents one of the cases), the final height of the flux rope varies with $M$ described by a power-law function $h / d =$ $1 0 ^ { - 0 . 1 } M ^ { - 1 . { \\bar { 1 } } }$ ：   \n(3）The flux rope can escape more easily if the background magnetic field is weaker. This implies that catastrophic behavior can be triggered by suppressing the strength of the background magnetic field,which is consistent with previous work by Forbes (199O),Isenberg et al.(1993), Lin et al. (1998); Lin (2007), Chen (2011). The decay of the photospheric magnetic field due to magnetic diffusion may result in the eruption of the flux rope (Mackay & van Ballegooijen 2006),and further explain why the peak rate of CME occurrence is usually delayed by $6 - 1 2$ （20 months with respect to the peak of the sunspot number (Robbrecht et al.2009).   \n(4）The initial radius of the flux rope may have a significant influence on its evolution. The results indicate that the flux rope with a larger initial radius erupts more easily.   \n(5） The internal flow of the flux rope remains small and does not last very long when the initial state of the flux rope commences from the stable branch of the theoretical equilibrium curve.We also find that the time and velocity of this flow are related to the computational domain.Provided that the grid points remain unchanged,the increase in the computational domain can result in a shorter time for the internal equilibrium of the flux rope,while the numerical error is in an expected range.
