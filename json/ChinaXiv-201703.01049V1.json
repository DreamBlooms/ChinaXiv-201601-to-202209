        "text": "Turbulent penetration can occur when hot and cold fluids mix in a horizontal T-junction pipe at nuclear plants. Caused by the unstable turbulent penetration, temperature fluctuations with large amplitude and high frequency can lead to time-varying wall thermal stress and even thermal fatigue on the inner wall.Numerous cases,however, exist where inner walltemperatures cannot be measured and only outer wall temperature measurements are feasible.Therefore,it is one of the popular research areas in nuclear science and engineering to estimate temperature fluctuations on the inner wall from measurements of outer walltemperatures without damaging the structure of the pipe.In this study,both the one-dimensional (1D)and the two-dimensional (2D) inverse heat conduction problem(IHCP) were solved to estimate the temperature fluctuations on the inner wallFirst, numerical models of both the 1Dand the 2D direct heat conduction problem (DHCP) were structured in MATLAB,based on the finite difference method with an implicit scheme.Second,both the 1D IHCP and the 2D IHCP were solved by the steepest descent method (SDM),and the DHCP results of temperatures on the outer wallwere used to estimate the temperature fluctuations on the inner wallThird,we compared the temperature fluctuations on the inner wall estimated by the 1D IHCP with those estimated by the 2D IHCP in four cases: (1) when the maximum disturbance of temperature of fluid inside the pipe was $3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ,(2) when the maximum disturbance of temperature of fluid inside the pipe was $3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ,(3)when the maximum disturbance of temperature of fluid inside the pipe was $1 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ,and (4) when the fluid temperatures inside the pipe were random from $5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ to $2 1 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ： ",

An IHCP was solved by LMM to determine the optimal geometry of the fillers between two conductive bodies in a twodimensional multiple-region domain [6]). (2） Leastsquares method (LSM) (Using the weighted LSM,we formulated an inverse problem of textile thickness-heat conductivity-porosity determination (IPT(THP) D) into a function minimization problem [7]. The temperaturedependent thermal diffusivities of two alloys were determined by solving an IHCP by LSM [8]). (3) Conjugate gradient method (CGM) (An IHCP was solved by CGM to identify the heat losses at the jaws of a tensile testing machine [9]. An IHCP was solved by CGM to estimate the time-dependent heat flux by using temperature distribution at a point in a three-layer system [1o]). (4) Genetic algorithm (GA) (An IHCP was solved by GA to identify the conductive and radiative parameters of a semitransparent sample [11]. An IHCP was solved by GA to determine the thermal conductivity of lumber [12]).(5 Steepest descent method (SDM) (An IHCP was solved by the SDM to identify the boundary of unknown inclusions inside an object by applying a heat source and measuring the induced temperature near the boundary of the sample [13].A solution of an IHCP was obtained by the SDM to determine the waste heat flux from a helicon plasma discharge by using the transient surface temperature measurements obtained from infrared thermography [14]). The SDM,which has great potential in solving IHCP, transforms the inverse problem to the solution of three problems，namely，the direct problem，the sensitivity problem,and the adjoint problem [15]. Although the SDM has great potential in solving IHCP, its validity in solving IHCP for a T-junction pipe under turbulent penetrationhasneverbeenexamined. ",
