        "text": "Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs or ErbBs) play crucial roles in numerous cellular processes. ErbB2 is a key member of ErbB family,and its overexpression is recognized as a frequent molecular abnormality. In cancer, this overexpression correlates with aggressive disease and poor patient outcomes. Dimer-dependent phosphorylation is a key event for the signal transduction of ErbBs. However, the molecular mechanism of the dimerization of ErbB2 remains elusive.In the present work, we report the homodimer architecture of the ErbB2 extracellular domain (ECD) which is unique compared with other dimer-models of ErbBs.The structure of the ErbB2 ECD homodimer represents a \"back to head\" interaction, in which a protruding $\\beta$ -hairpin arm in domain II of one ErbB2 protomer is inserted into a C-shaped pocket created by domains I-III of the adjacent ErbB2 protomer. This dimerized architecture and its impact on the phosphorylation of ErbB2 intracellular domain were further verified by a mutagenesis study.We also elucidated the different impacts of two clinically administered therapeutic antibodies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab,on ErbB2 dimerization. This information not only provides an understanding of the molecular mechanism of ErbBs dimerization but also elucidates ErbB2-targeted therapy at the molecular level. ",

The overexpression and dysfunctionofErbBsresultin cancer,diabetes,immune deficiencies,cardiovascular diseases,and other human diseases [1].Dimierziation of the extracellular domains (ECDs) activates the phosphorylation of the intracellular domains (ICD)s are the key events responsible for the signal transduction of ErbBs.To date, there are 11 ligands were identified to bind to ErbBs [2]. The current model of ligand-induced ErbB dimerization is proposed to be facilitatedbythe shiftbetweena‘tethered'intramolecular conformation and a dimerization-competent conformation. In the apo forms of ErbB1,ErbB3,and ErbB4,a protruding of domain II(designated as the‘dimerization arm') is buried within domainIVof the same molecule.In the dimerizationcompetent conformations,the dimerization arm and an adjacent loop are exposed to allow contact between the ECDs of two monomers [3,4].However, ErbB2 is not likelyto have a ligand,and the‘tethered’intramolecular conformation is absent[5,6].Previous results have revealed that ErbB2-ErbB1/3/4 heterodimers are the most preferred [7-9], suggesting that ErbB2 is likely to be in a constitutively activated configuration that can form signaling-active heterodimers (or homodimers) withouta ligand.However, it is not constitutively active when expressed at physiologically relevant levels in insect cells [1O].Moreover,a mutagenesis study[11] has shown that some mutations in domain I of the ErbB2 ECD,analogous to those ErbB1 mutants[12] that completely eliminated ErbB1homodimerization, did not affect ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimerization.Taken together, these results suggest that ErbB2 dimerization is different thanthe dimerizationmodel forErbB1ECD.
