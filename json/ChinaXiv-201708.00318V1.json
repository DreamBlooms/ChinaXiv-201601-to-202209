The modification of the invariant mass distributions for the $t$ -channel scalar exchange shows similar behavior to the one for the vector boson exchange [15, 25],and there is tension between the predictions at the data.

This is because of competition between the spin-correlation and the Rutherfold singularity for the scalar case, which can be seen from the opposite sign of the angular dependence between the numerator and denominator of the t-channel amplitude square term in Eq. (9). One can understand this behavior intuitively (although for a massless top quark) by supposing an initial up quark moves in the positive $z$ -direction, scattering through a $t$ -channel scalar particle to become a top quark. As usual, the zero angular momentum partial wave has the largest component. However, in order to conserve angular momentum along the $z$ -axis,the final top quark(which in the massless limit,has the opposite helicity state） must move in the negative $z$ -direction，and consequently does not receive a Rutherford enhancement.
