Compared to the forward structure which has been widely investigated,the inverted device structure gradually received more attentions in recent years since it makes the PSCs longterm stable [5-9]. ",

Therefore ZnO has been intensively exploited in the inverted device [1O,11].However, ZnO buffer layer has several problematic issues such as surface roughness,leakage currents, interfacial recombination and so on. The major concerns with ZnO buffer layer lie in the surface defects and the aggregation of ZnO NPs,which result in relatively low photovoltaic performance [12,13]. So more efforts should be made to modify the $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ buffer layerand develop low-defectand uniform ZnO film so as to realize high-efficiency inverted PSCs. ",

But the incompatible nature of organic molecule with metal oxides limits these applications.Therefore,one modified strategy is implemented by coating a thin self-assembled layer on the surface of ZnO layer such as carboxylic acid-functionlized fullerene [18,19] or conjugated polyelectrolyte [5]. It can fill the surface traps to improve electronic coupling of the ZnO/organic layer,so as to improve $J _ { s c }$ and $F F .$ ",

This eventually improves the $F F$ and the $J _ { s c }$ [8,24,25] by decreasing the electron injection barrier between photoactive layerand electrode.Furthermore, $C _ { 6 0 }$ -based self-assembled monolayer(SAM） formed onto ZnO NPs film has been systematically investigated in the OSCs [26].These modifiers serve multiple advantages,such as passivating surface charge traps to improve forward charge transfer,tuning the energy level offset and making up the upper organic layer morphology [27,28]. However, due to the acidic nature of the phosphonic anchoring group,the erosion of the $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ surface could induce potential device degradation, resulting in poor device performance.So the $C _ { 6 0 }$ -based modifiers with less-acidic binding units have been explored [12,29,30]. In addition,the modifiers with ester units possess much weaker acidity and have affinity to metal oxide surfaces [26].Moreover, the fullerenes with ester units have non-covalent interaction with the other $\\pi$ -conjugated molecules and retain the high electron mobility [22,31,32].

It isapparent that the EQE of the $Z n O / \\mathrm { P y C } _ { 6 0 }$ based device is slightly higher than that of the $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ based device in the wavelengthregionof $3 5 0 \\mathrm { - } 5 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ .Thepossible reason for the contradiction of the transmittance and the EQE is that the absorption of $Z n O / \\mathrm { P y C } _ { 6 0 }$ film may generate the photocurrent. In addition,the direct contact of $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ and photoactive layer may enhance internal photoelectron conversion efficiency by reducing the electron injection barrier between photoactive layer and ZnO film,which is also responsible for the increase of EQE [24,39]. On the other hand the EQE of the $Z n O / \\mathrm { P y C } _ { 6 0 }$ based device is decreased compared to the $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ based device in the region of $6 5 0 \\mathrm { - } 7 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ Therefore, the $J _ { s c }$ of the $Z n O / \\mathrm { P y } C _ { 6 0 }$ based device is very close to that of the ZnO based device.

        "text": "Inaddition, the surface potential was directly examined by KPFM (see Fig.S5 in the Supporting information).The measurement of $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } } /$ PyCflm obtained a $2 6 1 \\mathrm { m V }$ shift in average surface potential compared to that of $z _ { \\mathrm { n O } }$ film.The differences in surface potential demonstrate that the microscopic electric dipole between the $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } / }$ $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ filmand photoactive layer lowers the electron injection barrier. This can promote electron injection and reduce contact resistance with the photoactive layer [24,4O]. In addition,the surface potential was also influenced by the electronic states of film surface such as surface traps,surface reconstruction, chemical composition,etc.[41,42]. The modification of $z _ { \\mathrm { n O } }$ film by the $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ was studied by photoluminescence (PL) as well.As shown in Fig. S6,the emission band of ZnO film at $5 2 8 \\mathrm { n m }$ has been well known as an indicator of the defect states in ZnO NPs [43,44]. It is noticed that the defect emission becomes weaker when the $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ film is modified by the $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ The decrease of defect emission is probably because the surface traps are reduced, resulting inreduced interfacial charge recombination.Another reason for the decrease is that the defect emission is partly absorbed by $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ Therefore the decrease of defect emission may be the integration from the reduction of surface defect of ZnO NPs and optical absorption of $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ Since the defect emission band of $Z n O / \\mathrm { P y C } _ { 6 0 }$ film is only slightly weaker than that of $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ film which means most surface defects of ZnO NPs still retain,we conclude that the optical absorption of $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ is mainly responsible for the weakening of defect emission.In this case, the increment of surface potential of $Z n O / \\mathrm { P y C } _ { 6 0 }$ film might originate from the preferable surface morphology and the diminishment of surface traps,resulting in reducing charge recombination [45].

However it increases interfacial resistance and lowers light transmittance of interfacial film, influencing device performance negatively. So the performance is getting better with the $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ concentration decreasing.Furthermore,as the $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ concentration is further reduced to $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m g } \\mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ the device parameters show that the $J _ { s c }$ is improved,while the $V _ { o c }$ and the $F F$ are obviously decreased,giving an average PCE of $6 . 6 5 \\%$ The lower $\\mathrm { P y C } _ { 6 0 }$ concentration improves light transmittance of the $\\mathrm { Z n O / P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ film,while does not effectively fill in the surface voids and finally leads to leakage current [46]. So the optimal concentration of the $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ is $2 \\mathrm { m g } \\mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }$ and then the optimized $Z n O / \\mathrm { P y C } _ { 6 0 }$ film (about $3 2 { \\mathrm { n m } }$ ）forpreferable device performance can be achieved.Fig.5b shows the dark $J { - } V$ characteristic of devices with different $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ concentration. It is clear that the device using optimal $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ concentration has favorable diode characteristics and shows low leakage current.Meanwhile,the EQE curves of different $\\mathrm { P y C _ { 6 0 } }$ concentrations are shown in Fig.S7.The tendency ofEQE curves is in good agreement with thej data in Table 2.These results indicate that the suitable thickness of interfacial modified layer could effectively improve the device performance.
