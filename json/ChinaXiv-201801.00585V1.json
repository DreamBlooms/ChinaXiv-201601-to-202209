        "text": "Years of exploitation and utilization have gradually reduced domestic high-quality bauxite resources. Therefore,it is increasingly difficult to meet the demands of the rapid development of aluminum-making industry in China. China relies on considerable quantities of imported bauxite,and is thus the highest bauxite importer in the world[1-2]. The coal gangue output of China is approximated at about 20o million tons per year. As of 2010,China has 5 billion tons of stockpiled coal gangue. The chemical components of coal gangue are $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ ， $\\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ ，which account for more than $80 \\%$ of coal gangue,and ${ \\mathrm { A l } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 3 }$ accounting for $20 \\%$ to $3 5 \\% [ 3 ]$ . The effective extraction of ${ \\mathrm { A l } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 3 }$ from coal gangue will enable its high-value utilization and simultaneously ease the shortage of bauxite resources in China[4-5]. However, the current extraction rate of ${ \\mathrm { A l } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 3 }$ from coal gangue is low because the majority of ${ \\mathrm { A l } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 3 }$ in gangue exists as kaolinite,which is relatively stable and has low leaching activity. Research indicates that transforming stable kaolinite to metakaolin and further to an amorphous mineral might increase the leaching activity. Then,acid leaching or alkali leaching methods can effectively be used to extract ${ \\mathrm { A l } } _ { 2 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 3 }$ from activated coal gangue[6]. Coal gangue activation methods include calcination activation,machinery activation，chemical activation and compound activation[7-13]. Calcination activation is a simple and con venient method to transform kaolinite $( \\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } { \\cdot } 2 \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } { \\cdot } 2 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } )$ to $\\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 } { \\cdot } 2 \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ ，even amorphous $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ and active $\\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ these transformations increased the chemical reaction activity of coal gangue[14-16]. Previous research demonstrated that the calcination temperature and atmosphere were the two most important factors that affect coal gangue activity. Luo [17] posited that acid leaching to kaolinite rock calcinated at $7 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ may increase the $\\mathrm { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ leaching rate.Wang [18] determined that a calcination temperature of $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ effectively activates coal gangue.Si[19] demonstrated that the thermal conversion process of kaolinite is the same under ${ \\bf N } _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ atmospheres when the temperature is lower than $7 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ However,when the temperature exceeds $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ，the $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ atmosphere suppresses kaolinite product transformation.
