        "text": "Abstract: Potentila anserina L.and Elymus nutans Griseb.are dominant species in the subalpine meadows of China. Grazing is one of the most important factors that influence community structure and productivity of subalpine meadows. Understanding how grazing changes photosynthetic capability is essential for preservation and restoration of grasslands. However, information about the efects of grazing on photosynthetic capability remains inadequate. Experiments were conducted in fencing and grazing areas in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China. The leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic curves of $P .$ anserina and $E$ . nutans were measured at different growth stages. Results showed that grazing decreased the values of leaf gas exchange parameters, such as net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and intercellular $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ concentration of $P .$ anserina and $E$ 、 nutans. In addition, grazing decreased the values ofnet photosynthetic rate-photosynthetically active radiation $( P _ { \\mathrm { N } ^ { - } } \\mathrm { P A R } )$ curve parameters， such as light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, apparent quantum efficiency, light compensation point, light saturation point, and dark respiration rate. Our results demonstrated that grazing was the primary limiting factor for photosynthesis of dominant grassland species in the study area. ",

        "text": "Plant growing in natural conditions is limited by multiple environmental factors (i.e., light, water, temperature,and nutrition) and human disturbances (i.e., grazing,land use transformation, mining, deforestation,and environmental pollution) (Guo et al.,2007; Andrew et al., 2016; Busso et al., 2016; Casazza et al., 2016). The effects of environmental factors on plant growth are mainly slow and gradual, whereas those of human activities are mainly rapid and abrupt (Chesson, 2000; Wertin et al., 2015; Humphrey et al., 2016). Grazing,an anthropogenic activity has played an important role in controlling grass growth in natural grasslands. Some researchers have reported that heavy grazing restricts plant growth and production in grasslands (Bai et al.,2O15; Strahan et al., 2015; Pulido et al., 2016),while fencing and light grazing promote the normal growth of herbage (MaLler et al.,2014; Ruizalbarran et al.,2016). On the one hand, grazing directly affects photosynthesis by eating the ground part of grass. On the other hand, grazing affects the soil physical and chemical properties (i.e.， bulk density,water infiltration, soil organic mater, total nitrogen,and total phosphorus） that subsequently influence the ability of plants to assimilate photosynthate; thus, it is the major determinant of the potential productivity of grasslands (Wang et al.,2015; Ren et al.,2016).

        "text": "Livestock population has increased with increasing human population growth. Thus, grazing areas have expanded worldwide and seriously degraded grasslands (Wang and Wesche, 2016; Qian et al.,2017). Grazing not only controls grassland species diversity and composition, but also affects photosynthetic characteristics of major steppe species (Chen et al., 20o5; Herrero-Jauregui and Oesterheld,2017). Grazing restriction is a common approach for protection of grasslands, including rotational grazing and controlled grazing (Pei et al., 2008; Hu et al., 20o9;Wu et al., 2010; Mekuria, 2013; Zhang et al.， 2013). It is common knowledge that degraded grasslands resulting from overgrazing have been restored under five years after fencing conditions (i.e., five years of no grazing). However, studies on the difference in photosynthetic parameters of plants between under grazing and five years offencing conditions are scarce. Potentilla anserina L. and Elymus nutans Griseb.are $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 }$ perennial plants and the dominant species of subalpine meadows in China. They have high photosynthetic capacity and good forage quality (Xu et al., 2O06, 2011; Liu et al., 2016). In addition, they have an elaborate root system and high coverage, making them be important species in reducing water and soil losses (Jiao et al.,2009; Zhao et al.,20l7). Heavy grazing has significantly decreased the photosynthetic capacity of these species. However, information on the interaction between grazing and photosynthetic characteristics of these species remains limited.Therefore,this study is conducted to obtain such information by investigating the leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic curves of $P .$ anserina and $E$ .nutans in the subalpine meadows of China. Our objectives are (1) to compare the diurnal patterns of leaf gas exchange parameters of plants under fenzing and grazing conditions for five years; (2） to clarify the response curves of net photosynthetic rate-photosynthetically active radiation $( P _ { \\mathrm { N } } { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { P A R } )$ of plants under two regimes; and (3） to identify the difference in the photosynthetic capacity of plants under two regimes.

Five years fencing significantly improved the photosynthetic capacity in both species. In addition, fencing increased the daily mean $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ values in both species,which is consistent with the previous research results (Zhang et al., 2009； Zlatev and Fernando,2012；Tao et al.，2015； Ren et al.,2017). However, the patterns of $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ under both regimes varying across the three observation dates were different in $E$ nutans and $P .$ anserina, which was likely attributed to the different adaptions of the two species. The higher $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ values of plants in fencing plots indicated that the appropriate protective measurement could improve the photosynthetic performance and alleviate the detrimental efects of grazing pressure (Zhao et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017). The second peak of $P _ { \\mathrm { N } } ,$ firstly discovered in our study area,appeared at approximately 17:30, which is inconsistent with previous results (Xiao et al.,2006; Liu et al.,20l7),who reported that it occurred at approximately 14:0o.Previous results indicated that \"noon break\" was related to the environmental factors (Jiang et al.,2010; Yang et al., 2016). Our result was different from those of other studies,and the difference may be atributed to the mountain environment with high temperature and high PAR during the period from 12:00 to 16:00. Our results showed that grazing significantly decreased $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ ，This result was consistent with the conclusion of Ghorbani et al. (2012),who reported that grazing decreased the carbon accumulation in mountainous arid and semi-arid rangelands. Fencing increased the daily mean values of $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ ， $P _ { \\mathrm { N m a x c a l } }$ ， and PNmaxobs, showing that five years of fencing could enhance the potential photosynthetic capacity of $E$ nutans and $P .$ anserina under natural conditions.

        "text": "External stress could decrease the photosynthetic activity of plants by reducing carboxylation efficiency (e.g.， stomatal closure and inhibiting light reaction) (Mudrik et al., 2O03; Gu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). The control of stomatal activity (i.e., transpiration, opening,and closure) is an active adaptive pattern of pasture species in response to environmental stress in semi-arid regions (Xoconostle-Cazares et al.,2010; Wu et al., 2015). Stomatal closure is the first response of grass species to external stress, such as mild to moderate drought stress. However, nonstomatal limitation factors dominate under severe drought stress (Flexas and Medrano, 2002; Jia et al., 2012; Wang et al.，2015； Abdi et al., 2016). Farquhar and Sharkey (1982） demonstrated that the stomatal factor is the dominant limiting factor of photosynthetic capacity only if $L _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ increases and $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ and $C _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ simultaneously decrease. Otherwise,nonstomatal factors are the limiting and dominant factors of photosynthetic capacity. In our study,the reduction in the $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ values of $P .$ anserina under fencing and grazing conditions was caused by stomatal limitation.However, the decreases in the $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ and $L _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ of $E$ ，nutans were accompanied by an increase in $C _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ from 13:0O to 16:0o, indicating that nonstomatal factors are the limiting factors for the photosynthetic capacity.The difference in the photosynthetic capacities of the two species might be caused by $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ and environmental factors. $P .$ anserina has conspicuously higher $g _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ values than $E$ 、nutans,hence, $P .$ anserina is less sensitive to external stress than $E$ .nutans.Nonstomatal limitation for $E$ ，nutans during the period of 13:0O to l6:0O might be also caused by high air temperature and radiation. Some studies have shown that the change in $P _ { \\mathrm { N } }$ induced by stomatal limitation is often caused by environmental factors (Xia et al.,2015; Urban et al.,2017),and some studies pointed that extreme environmental factors might act as nonstomatal limitation factors for photosynthetic capacity (Borchard et al.,2015;Erel et al.， 2015;Fu et al.，2015; Ramalhosa et al., 2017).

In the study, the daily mean WUE of the two species was higher in fencing plot than in grazing plot. However, the variation in daily mean WUE for both plant species under fencing and grazing conditions was greater on 25 June and 26 August than on 23 July. This finding may be attributed to higher rainfall during July than other months. By comparing the WUE of the two species under both regimes,we inferred that grazing might afect photosynthetic capacity and subsequently affect the normal growth of grass. ",
