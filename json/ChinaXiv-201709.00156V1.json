The simplest dark energy candidate is the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ with the equation of state $w = - 1$ . The tiny cosmological constant together with the cold dark matter (CDM) (called the ACDM model) turned out to be the standard model which fits the current observational data sets consistently.In spite of this success,however,it is faced with the fine-tuning problem [3] and the coincidence problem.The former arises from the fact that the present-time observed value for the vacuum energy density is more than 12O orders of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate from quantum field theory. The later is the question why we live in such a special moment that the densities of dark energy anddark matter are of the same order. ",

        "text": "Many attempts have been made to tackle those issues, including introducing“dynamical” dark energy or modifying general relativity at the cosmic scales. In particular,to alleviate the coincidence problem,an interaction between dark energy and dark matter has been considered extensively in the literature, for example,in [4-17] and references therein.However,usually the interaction form has to be assumed. The assumed form will lead to a bias when observational data are used to give the constraint on the interaction.In [11] the authors investigated the possible interaction in a way independent of specific interacting forms by dividing the whole range of redshift into a few bins and setting the interacting term to bea constant in each redshift bin.It was found that the interaction is likely to cross the noninteracting line and has an oscillation behavior.Recently, Salvatelli et al. [15] showed that the null interaction is excluded at 99% confidence level (C.L.）when they added the redshift-space distortions (RSD) data to the Planck data for the decaying vacuum energy model (a class of interaction of dark sectors).They parametrized the interaction term to be of the form $q H \\rho$ and also subdivided the redshift into four bins with $q ( z ) = q _ { i } ( i = 1 , \\dots , 4 )$ . More recently, the authors of Ref.[18] have reconstructed the temporal evolution of the coupling strength between dark matter and vacuum energy, $\\alpha ( a )$ in a nonparametric Bayesian ap proach using the combined observational data sets from the cosmic microwave background radiation,supernovae and large scale structure.It was found that an evolving interaction can remove some of the tensions between different types of data sets,and is favored at $\\sim 9 5 \\%$ C.L. if the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements of the BOSS Lyman- $\\alpha$ forest sample are included.Thus,it is quite interesting to see whether there exists some signatureof the interaction from the observational data in a model-independent way.

First, let us consider the decaying vacuum energy case with $w = - 1$ [15]. Figure 5 shows the reconstructed $D ( z )$ and its derivatives from Union 2.1 data. The error is a little larger than that for the reconstruction of the DES survey due to the smaller number of SNe Ia and larger measurement errors. The reconstruction of the interaction $\\tilde { q } ( z )$ is shown in Fig.6.We see that both the distance $D ( z )$ and interaction $\\tilde { q } ( z )$ are consistent with the $\\Lambda$ CDM model,which implies that there is no evidence for the existence of the interaction.
