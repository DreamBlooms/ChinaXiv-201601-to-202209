        "text": "Enantiornithes is the most diverse recognized group of Mesozoic birds,considered the first major avian radiation. Although specimens have been collected from continental and marine sediments on all continents with the exception of Antarctica,like other bird fossils,these remains are typically isolated and fragmentary (O'Connor et al.,2O11). The major exception is the Early Cretaceous deposits in northeastern China that have produced the 130.7-120 Ma Jehol Biota (Pan et al.,2013),preserving the second oldest recognized fossil avifauna surpassed only by the Late Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones in Germany that produce Archaeopteryx (Wellnhofer, 20o8). Despite its age, the Jehol avifauna accounts for approximately half of the entire diversity of Mesozoic birds including a huge diversity of enantiornithines (Wang M et al., 2014; Wang X et al., 2014; Zhou and Zhang, 2006).As new species steadily continue to be discovered, several distinct clades have been recognized (e.g., the Bohaiornithidae, Longipterygidae). The most temporally successful of these enantiornithines lineages is the Pengornithidae.The first specimen, the holotype of Pengornis houi,was described by Zhou et al. in 2Oo8 and already this group is one of the most diverse enantiornithine clades in the Jehol avifauna. Currently there are five specimens representing four genera (Pengornis,Parapengornis, Eopengornis,and Chiappeavis) (Hu et al.,2015; O'Connor et al.,2016; Wang X et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2008). The holotype of Pengornis houi is the largest known Early Cretaceous enantiornithine. Eopengornis is from the 130.7 Ma Protopteryx-horizon of the Huajiying Formation and all other taxa are from the $1 2 0 \\ \\mathrm { M a }$ Jiufotang Formation. Pengornithids are the most recognizable enantiornithines,with their characteristic numerous small,low-crowned teeth,hooked scapular acromion,bilaterally formed sternum without intermediate trabeculae,elongate femur, unreduced fibula, metatarsal V, and elongate metatarsal I and hallux.These characters are mostly primitive features strongly suggesting that pengornithids are basal within the Enantiornithes,consistent with recent phylogenetic analyses and the fact Eopengornis is among the oldest known enantiornithines (Wang X et al., 2014).

        "text": "The most recently described pengornithid, Chiappeavis magnapremaxillo, preserves the first clear evidence that some members of the Enantiornithes possessed rectricial fans (Fig.1),similar to those present in the basal pygostylian Sapeornis and members of the Ornithuromorpha (Clarke et al., 2006; Zheng et al.,2013), the clade that includes all living birds nested within. The unique shape of the pengornithid pygostyle, being relatively more similar to that of ornithuromorphs and Sapeornis than other enantiornithines, suggests that the rectricial fan evolves together with the rectricial bulbs necessary to control them, which in turn shapes the pygostyle (O'Connor et al., 2016). The holotype and only known specimen of Chiappeavis magnapremaxillo STM 29-1l was only briefly described with regards to its skeletal morphology. Here we provide a complete description and further explore the unique morphology of the pengornithid pygostyle.We reconstruct the tail fans of several well preserved Jehol ornithuromorphs and compare the aerodynamic lift generated by different tail shapes and discuss the significance of this information.

        "text": "This description provides only new anatomical information regarding STM 29-11 (Fig. 2). The enlarged premaxillary corpus and elongate nasal processes that distinguish Chiappeavis from other pengornithids have already been described in detail (O'Connor et al.,2016). The maxillary process of the premaxilla is robust, sharply tapered,and roughly equal to the length of the corpus (Fig.3). The premaxille form a medial wedged articulation with the nasals although the extent of this articulation is unclear due to poor preservation of the nasals.A fragment of the left nasal is preserved articulating with the frontal; it appears narrower than the nasal in Pengornis IVPP V 15336 (Zhou et al.,2008).Although the maxilla forms most of the facial margin in Pengornis V 15336 (Zhou et al.,2008) and all other known pengornithids (Hu et al.,2014,2015; Wang X et al.,2014), only possible fragments are preserved in Chiappeavis STM 29-11. Part of the scleral ring is preserved in the orbit. Other fragments may represent pieces of the pterygoids. Ventrally,a thin, distally upturned rod-like element is identified as the jugal. A robust fragment of bone is preserved dorsal and in parallel to the jugal; this bone may be a piece of the jugal process of the maxilla but it appears unusually robust. Part of the palate is visible through the left external nares (Fig. 3). Both vomers are preserved presumably in dorsal view.As in Gobipteryx they appear to be fused along their rostral halves, caudally diverging at a $1 5 ^ { \\circ }$ angle (nearly parallel in Gobipteryx).This suggests that like Gobipteryx the choana was rostrally located compared to neornithines (Chiappe et al., 20o1). However, unlike in Gobipteryx and neognathous birds, as preserved the vomers appear to retain the plesiomorphic tetrapod condition, reaching and presumably articulating with the premaxilae, as in paleognathous birds and potentially Archaeopteryx (Witmer and Martin, 1987).A fragment of bone preserved between the left vomer and the maxillary process of the premaxilla may be a piece of the maxillary contribution to the palate. The caudal half of the skull is poorly preserved, crushed and heavily abraded, revealing no anatomical details.The tip of the left dentary is blunt; barely visible, numerous small teeth are preserved in separate aveoli.The ",

The poorly developed glenoid and scapular cotyla are separated by a deep pit, which may be an artefact of crushing and obscuring the presence of an acrocoracoidal tubercle. Just distal to the scapular articular surface the supracoracoid nerve foramen pierces the neck of the coracoid, separated from the medial margin by a complete boney bar; it does not appear to open into a medially located groove as it does in many other enantiornithines (Chiappe and Walker, 2Oo2). The corpus makes up the distal half of the coracoid. The distal quarter of the lateral margin is convex,expanding the width of the sternal margin. The convex distal portion of the lateral margin appears distinctly thinner and flatter than the rest of the coracoidal corpus.This morphology of the lateral margin of the coracoid is also observed in other pengornithids (Eopengornis,Parapengornis V 18687) as well as bohaiornithid enantiornithines (Wang M et al.,2014).

The age of the specimen has not been explored through histology because there are no breaks in the long bones of STM 29-11 to allow non-destructive sampling of this particularly nice specimen. However, the sternum is fully fused in the subadult holotype of Eopengornis martini STM 24-1 and V18632.This indicates that STM 29-11 is at a relatively earlier ontogenetic stage and strongly suggests it would have increased in size with maturity. The sternum in Parapengornis V 18687 is also medially unfused, despite its much smaller size (Table 1) and histology confirms that this specimen is immature, with no remodelling present to indicate the individual was mature or nearly so. Parapengornis sp.V 18632 has a fully fused sternum but is roughly $1 5 \\%$ smaller than Parapengornis V 18687 indicating these specimens may represent different species (see phylogenetic analysis).

The matrix includes a total of 63 taxa, 24 of which are referable to the Enantiornithes.Using TNT software (Goloboff et al., 2008) we conducted a heuristic search using tree-bisection reconnection (TBR) retaining the single shortest tree out of every 1,0o0 replications. This produced 824 most parsimonious trees with a length of 897 steps.A second round of TBR produced more than 10,000 trees of the same length.In the strict consensus,all nodes collapsed except Aves itself. Investigation of the MPTs revealed that in $78 \\%$ of the trees Pengornithidae was resolved. The clade formed by Jeholornis $^ +$ all more derived birds collapses due to the basal position of the fragmentary taxon Chaoyangia resolved by a small percentage of MPTs. In order to reduce the effects of homoplasy (Goloboff et al.,2O08), which strongly characterizes early avian evolution (Brusate et al.,2O15),we reran the analysis with the same parameters using implied weighting $( \\mathbf { k } = 1 . 0$ 2.0,and 3.0) (Goloboff,1993).With a $\\mathbf { k }$ value of 1.0, the analysis produced 24 trees $( { \\mathrm { T B R } } =$ 129.47). The strict consensus is well resolved with pengornithids forming successive outgroups to all other enantiornithines.With higher k values (2.0,3.O) Pengornithidae is resolved as a clade that is sister taxon to all other enantiornithines (Fig. 7).

        "text": "Pengornithid diversity Five pengornithid specimens are now recognized, representing at least four distinct genera (Chiappeavis,Eopengornis,Parapengornis,and Pengornis). Pengornithids are unusual birds,differing from other enantiornithines in the morphology of the sternum (e.g. ossifying from a pair of medially fused bilateral plates and having only a single pair of caudal trabeculae), pygostyle (shorter, wider, with proximally restricted ventrolateral processes, often having a midline invagination on the caudal margin),and ischium (slender without a dorsal process). In addition, they possess features more typical of long boney-tailed birds or basal pygostylians, such as the presence of a metatarsal V and an elongate fibula. This marked increase in homoplasy caused by the inclusion of five pengornithids has thus resulted in a collapse in weakly resolved relationships from previous analyses, making a strong case for the use of implied weighting. Without the use of implied weighting Pengornithidae is only resolved in $78 \\%$ of the MPTs,but in $98 \\%$ of all MPTs V18632 and Eopengornis form a clade, thus not supporting previous inferences that V 18632 should be referred to Parapengornis (Hu et al.,2015). This is further supported by differences in body size between V 18632 and Parapengornis $\\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 1 8 6 8 7$ (see Ontogenetic status). Difference in size, morphology (Fig. 5), and stratigraphic level also suggest $\\mathrm { ~ V ~ } 1 8 6 3 2$ is not referable to Eopengornis martini.Because the specimen is a subadult, Hu et al., (2014) originally refrained from naming V18632 (Pengornis sp.),later referring it to Parapengornis (Hu et al., 2015).Here we regard this specimen as Pengornithidae indeterminate.Notably, Eopengornis and Parapengornis share a common tail morphology consisting of a pair of elongate, fully pennaceous rachis dominated feathers but are not found to be closely related; instead,Eopengornis is found to be more closely related to Chiappeavis,despite their disparate tail morphologies. This may suggest that this analysis does not accurately portray pengornithid relationships or that pengornithid plumage was as evolutionarily labile as in extant avian families (Gluckman,2O14).In favor of the former, the pygostyle of Chiappeavis is most similar to that of Pengornis with regards to ",

        "text": "Tail-fan performance in Early Cretaceous birdsEven in the Jehol Biota,at the earliest known stage of pygostylian evolution with data limited by fossilization, there exist observable differences in the shape and relative size of the rectricial fan between clades and individual taxa. Compared to all Jehol ornithuromorphs preserving tail fans (Yixianornis, Yanornis,Hongshanornis,Schizooura,Piscivoravis) (Chiappe et al.,2014; Clarke et al.,2006) (Fig. 8), the tail is proportionately shorter relative to body length in Chiappeavis STM 29- 11 (Table 2). These taxa also differ in the degree of gradation (measured as the difference in length between the longest and shortest rectrices). Subtle differences in tail shape and length can be used to understand the selective pressures responsible for producing each phenotype. Lift is determined by the maximum continuous width, therefore any elongation beyond this point is considered the product of sexual selection,being not optimized for flight (Thomas and Balmford,1995). In one test area, $80 \\%$ of all bird species were found to have tail displays of some kind (Fitzpatrick,1997). Although two tails of equal width have the same lift,longer tails generate greater moments for turning; the trade-off is that longer tails require greater muscle force and incur more drag (Thomas and Balmford,1995). Thus the huge diversity of avian tail morphologies represents the product of these and the numerous other selective forces that exist in the varied ecologies and lifestyles occupied by birds.The graded morphology in Sapeornis and even the round morphology in ornithuromorphs indicate that although capable of generating lift, these tails were not optimized for aerodynamic function, being also shaped by sexual/signal selection. The difference between the longest and shortest rectrices is highest in ",

Shorter tails tend to be adapted for higher flight speeds and greater lift to drag ratios,whereas longer tails increase maneuverability and are found in woodland birds where the cluttered environment selects for increased maneuverability and high-speed flight is infrequent (Thomas,1997; Thomas and Balmford,1995). Thus the presence of long round-tails in most ornithuromorphs indicates these taxa well adapted for the forested Jehol paleoenvironment (Zhou, 2004). Since longer tails require greater muscle force,the proportionately shorter tail in Chiappeavis supports inferences based on pygostyle morphology that rectricial bulbs,if present, were poorly developed in enantiornithines. Some extant birds have a pygostyle similar to that of enantiornithines in which the dorsal surface is expanded (having a dorsal platform and thus no dorsally blade-like pygostyle lamina) to provide additional surface area for the attachment of enlarged caudal levator muscles,yet these taxa retain rectricial bulbs (Wang and O'Connor, in press). Thus the absence of a pygostyle lamina does not exclude enantiornithines from having this structure. ",

We recognize that the preserved width is not necessarily the optimal or maximal spread of the tail in flight, but like living birds we assume a range of widths were possble at least in the Ornithuromorpha. We assume equal postmortem compression of the rectricial bulbs (or comparable tail musculature in Chiappeavis and Sapeornis) resulting in a comparable degree of tail spread between Jehol specimens. Specimens preserved in lateral view were considered unsuitable for analysis.For Jehol birds these measurements represent conservative estimates of the tail's lift capabilities. The tail fan of Chiappeavis is estimated to have the least efficient tail shape, whereas the tails in most Jehol ornithuromorphs have almost double the lifting power for their given body mass (Table 2).These measurements support our predictions based on the shape of the pygostyle and associated rectricial fan.The limited function of the enantiornithine tail fan, quantified here for the first time,provides support for the hypothesis that this is the cause of the restricted distribution of this feature in the Enantiornithes.Paired with limited musculature (as inferred from pygostyle morphologyï¼and the potential absence of the ability to control the spread of the tail fan,the enantiornithine aerodynamic rectricial fan may not have provided a great enough reproductive advantage to be retained through natural selection. This is at odds with derived skeletal features present in Chiappeavis (enlarged premaxilla, longer synsacrum), which may alternatively suggest that a tail fan was independently evolved in the Chiappeavis lineage.
