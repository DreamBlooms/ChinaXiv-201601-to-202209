Recent studies with human subjects showed that short-term HMF-exposure enlarges the pupil size，reduces the vision-related perception capacity[3-4] and also reduces the circulation efficiencyl5], suggesting the HMF is a stress factor threating astronauts.Animal experiments showed that the HMF affects behaviors and brain functions. Long-term HMF exposure interrupts the circadian activity of different animals $[ 6 - 8 ]$ Chicks hatched in the HMF $( \\sim 2 ~ \\mathrm { n T } )$ isimpairedin gustation-related memory[9]. Drosophila offspring, bred in the HMF are gradually(1O-generations) disabled in vision-related learning and memory [lo].Rat treated in the HMF for 3 months desynchronizes the biorhythms in brain [11]. After long-term HMF treatment( $( 2 \\sim$ 6 months),the golden hamster is determined with reduced noradrenalin (NA) level in the brain stem[12]. Short-term orpulsed HMF-exposurereduces stress-induced thermal hyperalgesia in mice[13-15]. HMF treatment (3 hours） lightens seizures of amygdalarly kindled epileptic-model rats [1σ]． All the evidence indicates adverse effects of the HMF exposure on behaviors and brain function of animals and human beings.However， these HMF effects were largely reported sporadically， and conducted in different experimental set ups or on different species [1， 17]. Furtherinvestigations areneededto determinewhether the effects are specific or consistent in different species,especially in mammals,and to reveal the underlyingmechanisms. ",

Rats subjected to 25-day HMF-exposure exhibited increased intraspecific violent at night and decreased food-motivated behavior in the morning[19]. We found that at day 14 of the HMF-exposure, the drinking attempts of adult mice， which largely happened at night-time,increased at the drink period. While at day 3O, the drinking attempts increased only at the rest periods (Figure 2). Increased drinking activity at day 14 suggests that the mice consumed more energy during their active period which could contribute to the decrease trend in their body growth[8]. Paradoxical sleep deprivationcouldreducethe locomotion in rat [20]. The increased drinking activity indicates that mice got less rest in the HMF,which probably leads to decreased general activity in the elevated plus maze test. ",

NA plays multiple functions, like increasing brainresponsivenessandinducingsympathetic responses such as heart rate, trigger the release of glucose from energy stores and increase blood flow to skeletal muscle.The reduction of serum NA level could cause multiple effects related to altered circadian rhythms and decreased general activity, as observed in the HMF. According to previous reports, the decrease in peripheral NA is consistent with the HMF-induced decrease of circulation efficiencyl@, and reduction of brain NA levels in HMF-exposed golden hamster and HMF-hatched chicken were accompanied with various behavioral disorders，includinginactivation[12, 22]. Exogenous injection of NA could restore impaired long-term memory of chicken[22]. Moreover, both NA and opioid are involved in pathways of anti-nociception, and work as synergic action[23-24]. Prato et al. proposed that the HMF effect on thermal hyperalgesia was opioid related, and opioid antagonist could abolished the effect[15], though the possible involvement of NA in this effect was not discussed in their paper. Thus,the down-regulated NA level probably contributesto disrupted behaviors including thermal hyperalgesia in the HMF-exposed animals. In addition， serotonin metabolism has close relationship with circadian rhythm regulation[25], and the HMF can modulate the serum serotonin level [26] and expression of serotonin receptors [27]． Thus, the serotonin system could be another candidate in the further investigation of the mechanism mediating behavioral responses of the mice to the HMF.
