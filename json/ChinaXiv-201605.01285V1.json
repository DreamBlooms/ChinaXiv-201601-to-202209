        "text": "In eukaryotic cells,the genomic DNA must be tightly packaged into chromatin to fit inside a nucleus that has a diameter of onlya few microns.During the last three decades,the structure of chromatin has been extensively studied.Early studies had already revealed that the basic repeating structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome,and it is now well established that it is comprised of the core particle and linker DNA[1]. The nucleosome core particle(NCP) consists of 147 base pairs(bp)of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones,with two copies of each H2A,H2B,H3 and H4,and about1.7 superhelical turnsarranged ina left-handed manner [2]. The nucleosome cores are connected by linker DNA, which typically ranges from 1O to 9o bp in length,to form a \"beads-on-a-string\"nucleosomal array with a diameter of $1 1 \\mathrm { n m }$ The nucleosomal array represents the first level of DNA compaction [3].Linker histones(H1 and H5）bind to the DNA linker regions in close proximity to the sites of DNA entry and exit to the NCP,and organize the nucleosomal arrays into a more condensed $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber,regarded as the second level of DNA compaction [4,5]. The structure of the NCP has been determined by $\\mathsf { X }$ -raycrystallographyat $1 . 9 { - } 2 . 8 \\mathring \\mathrm { A }$ resolution [2,6]. However,despite considerable efforts during the last three decades,the structure of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fibers,together with the role of linker histones in its formation, still remains to be resolved [3,7]. Whilst biochemical and structural data suggest that the folding of nucleosome arrays is mainly driven by nucleosome-nucleosome interactions,the precise path of the linker DNA within the fiber is still incompletely understood.Since a high-resolution crystal structure of the chromatosome(NCP with linker DNA and linker histone）is still lacking,the precise location of the linker histone in the chromatosome remains under debate [8,9].

The positioning sequence isa2o8-bp DNA fragment isolated fromaLytechinus variegatus 5S rRNA gene [18].Using this system,numerous studies have shown that the reconstituted nucleosome arrays in the absence of linker histones can reversibly fold into secondary chromatin structures that resemble structures formed by native chromatin that lacksH1 [19]. Moreover， nucleosomal arrays reconstituted with H1 behave similarly to native chromatin,folding in the presence of monovalent or multivalent ions in vitro [20].Thus,the reconstituted system reflects the ability of native chromatin to form primary，secondary and tertiary chromatin structures.

Dorigo et al. studied the reconstituted oligonucleosome arrays containing recombinant core histones using NRLs of 167,177 and 208 bp,in either presence or absence of linker histone H1.EM photographs of these reconstitutes showed two-start flat ribbons with about 5 nucleosomes per $1 1 \\mathrm { n m }$ inlength[22],rather than the helical arrangement with about 6-7 nucleosomes per 11 in nm length,as observed previously in isolated native chromatin [11].In a subsequent landmark study,Schalch et al.solved the crystal structure of tetranucleosome with NRL of 167 bp in the absence of linker histones to a resolution of $9 \\mathring { \\mathsf { A } }$ ,and revealed a structure with nucleosomes stacked perpendicularly to its axis [24].Although the resolution Was relatively low,the overall structure clearly showed two rows of two nucleosome stacks with the three-linker DNA segments criss-crossing between them, thus supporting the zig-zag(cross-linker） model of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber.Importantly,this zig-zag conformation is in agreement with the in vitro crosslinking studies performed in solution with longer nucleosomal arrays (12 nucleosome repeats) [22,25] and in vivo analysis of chromatin fragmentation patterns generated by ionizing radiation [26].Their proposed idealized model is a twisted ribbon with a diameter of about $2 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ and a compaction density of 5-6 nucleosomes per $1 1 \\mathrm { n m }$ ： ",

Rhodes and colleagues found that both linker histone and NRL determine the structure of chromatin fiber [27].In the absence of linker histone, the 167-bp NRL array displayed a highly ordered “ladder\"-like structure consisting of stacked nucleosomes in two-start helix arrangement,which is reminiscent of that previously observed by Richmond and colleagues of the 167-bp NRL nucleosome array [22].In addition,Robinson et al.also showed that their reconstitutes comprise two additional classes of structures;one with repeat lengths of up to 2O7bp and a diameter of $3 3 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ ,the other with repeat lengths of 217,227and 237bp and a diameter of $4 4 \\mathrm { n m }$ [23].

Our structures of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fibers provide the most detailed view of the intrinsic structure of a linker histone-containing chromatin fiber,and our structures clearly reveal a histone H1-dependent,left-handed twist of the repeating tetranucleosomal structural units [28] (Fig.1,panel B and C). The structures constitute the largest fragments of chromatin fibers revealed at this resolution,allowinga clear definition of the spatial location of all individual nucleosomes and tracing the path of linker DNA (Fig.1，panel A). Different NRLs(177-bp or 187-bp 6O1 DNA sequence) did not affect the overall architecture of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fibers but changed the fiber dimension,which is consistent with the fundamental prediction of a basic zig-zag two-start helix model [14,16,22,24]. Interestingly,a tetranucleosomal repetitive unit was observed in the cryo-EM structures of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber (Fig.1, panel B and C;Fig. 2, panel A and B). The architecture of tetranucleosomal unit appears very similar to the resolved $\\mathsf { x }$ -ray structure of a tetranucleosome with the 167-bp NRL in the absence of linker histone [24] (Fig.2,panel C and D). The results indicate that the presence of H1 and the length change of linker DNA by 1O bp do not affect the interactions within the nucleosome stack,but affects the separation and rotation between the two stacks.In addition,the 3D cryo-EM structure also shows that the packing density of the left-handed helical $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber is about 6.1-6.4 nucleosomes per $1 1 \\mathrm { - n m }$ turn,which agrees well with many other studies [5],but which is lower than the density of the more compacted fibers (1O-12 nucleosomes per $1 1 \\mathrm { n m }$ ） assembled under conditions that favor more charge neutralization [23].In principle,a higher packing density could be accommodated bya concertina-like motion that would reduce the vertical separation between successive turns of the fiber [29].Although our 3D cryo-EM structures for the reconstituted $3 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ chromatin fiber with NRLs of 177- and 187-bp show a left-handed twist of the repeating tetra-nucleosomal structural units with a two-start “Zig-Zag\"configuration,other forms of chromatin structures may existin different conditions，forexample， the one-start \"Solenoid”structure in the presence of H5 and magnesium with longer NRLs as discussed above [23].

The globular domain of histone H1 is shown to be internally located,relative to the axis of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber (Fig.3,panel A),which is consistent with previous observations [47].Inaddition,our cryo-EM structure visualized for the first time the location of H1,and thus elucidated its precise role in the formation of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber.An apparent off-axis asymmetric binding of the globular domain of H1 in the chromatosome can be clearly seen in the cryo-EM structure (Fig.3,panel B).This asymmetric location of H1 in the chromatosome thus confers polarity on the symmetric core nucleosome.In such a way,successive nucleosomes in the same stack have opposite polarities within the tetranucleosomal unit,which allows the self-association of the globular domain of the linker histone H1 between tetranucleosomal units in the fiber(Fig.3，panel A; Fig.4,panel A).H1-H1 self-associations had been reported earlier to play an important role in the organization and stabilization of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber [48,49].The self-association of the linker histone H1 between tetranucleosomal units thereby can stabilize coherent stacking in the tetranucleosome unit,and thus impart anadditional twist between each tetranucleosomal structural unit, ultimately resulting in the formation of the final helical structure of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber (Fig. 4, panel A).

Interestingly,our 3D cryo-EM structure reveals that both interaction modes play important roles in the folding of chromatin fiber,which is ina good agreement with previous predictions [2,24,55].However,in contrast to previous assumptions of a sequential arrangement of nucleosomes with uniform orientations,we observed alternating internucleosomal contacts between spatially adjacent nucleosomes in our 3D cryo-EM structure of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber.This observation is supported by previous the dinucleosomal repeat patterns in the DNase I digestion[15,56].In contrast to earlier predictions [2],the tetranucleosome emerges now as the main constitutive repeating unit of the fiber,which allows contact between the exposed surfaces of two H2A-H2B core histone dimers,similar to that observed previously in the tetranucleosome crystal structure (Fig.2,panel D).However,no interaction was observed between the H4N-terminus and the acidic patch of the neighboring nucleosomes within the tetranucleosomal unit. Instead,between the tetranucleosomal units,there are contacts between the N-terminal tail of H4,primarily involving residue Arginine 23 and the acidic patches of the H2A-H2B dimer on the faces of the opposite nucleosomes in their respective adjacent units (Fig.4, panel B),which also account for the twist between the tetranucleosomal units. To this end,it is of great interest to note that an‘arginine-anchor' binding to the H2A-H2B acidic patch,which plays an important role in the nucleosomal recognition,has been observed in all chromatin factor-NCP crystal structures [57].In comparison to the closely stacked nucleosomes within the tetranucleosomal structural unit,the apparent gaps present between the tetranucleosomal units may provide a platform for histone modifications or other architectural proteins，allowing the modulation of the internucleosomal surface interactions required for the regulation of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber structure.Our results also fully agree with recent cryo-electron tomography studies carried out in situ on chromatin fibers of chicken erythrocyte nuclei [58]. Using a chromatin model system containingup to four nucleosomes,Shogren-Knaak and colleague found that the ligated tetranucleosomal arrays undergo intra-array compaction in a histone H4 tail-independent manner [59],suggesting that the interaction between H4 tail and the acidic patch of adjacent nucleosomes is not responsible for the compaction of the tetranucleosomal unit. Interestingly,the cryo-EM structure of histone octamer helical tubes suggested thatan internucleosomaltwofold symmetric four-helix bundle,formed between pairs of H2B- $^ { . \\mathsf { q } 3 }$ and H2B-αC helices of neighboring octamers,stabilizes the chromatin fiber[6O].However, the $\\scriptstyle \\mathrm { H } 2 \\mathrm { B } - \\alpha 3 / \\alpha C$ internucleosomal four-helix bundle was not observed in our cryoEM map of reconstituted chromatin fiber.

The NRL variability poses a major methodological problem,as it is extremely difficult to obtain crystallographic or high-resolution images on the basis of such heterogeneous chromatin.To circumvent the NRL variability problem, and to gain highly detailed structural information, computational efforts in modeling the structure of compact chromatin fibers have focused primarily on the role of electrostatic internucleosomal interactions,as well as the length and local geometry of linker DNA [64-66]. These studies showed that the twist-angle of the nucleosomes along the DNA plays an important role in determining the straight-linker superhelical structure. In particular,the nucleosomes prefer to be oriented with their symmetry axes parallel to the fiber axis for repeat lengths that are integer multiples of the DNA pitch,and with perpendicular axes for half-integer multiples of the pitch [66]. Extended structures are formed for repeat lengths close to an integer multiple of pitch,with much shorter fibers of near half-integer multiples[66].In addition,some linker DNA lengths result in a collapse of the superhelix into a planar structure,but such structures would involve an overlap of the nucleosomes themselves and are therefore unphysical. In this case, the ground-state structure requires deformation of the linker DNA to reposition the nucleosomes so as to avoid steric overlap [66]. Most recently,the effect of a wide range of intrafiber NRL variations in chromatin fiber structure was explored through the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the mesoscale chromatin model [67].The authors found a remarkable effect of non-uniform NRLs in the organization and compactions of chromatin fiber,with a wide range of different architectures emerging(highly bent narrow forms,canonical and irregular zig-zag fibers,as well as polymorphic conformations),depending on the NRLs mixed together [67]. In this study,three different simulations were performed,and they found that non-uniform short linker DNA fibers exhibited a compact conformation,with a large bend along the fiber axis. Using medium- to long-range linker DNA and moderate NRL variation, heteromorphic conformations with both straight (zig-zag type) and bent linker DNAs were observed,which was consistent with the previous finding from EM-assisted nucleosome interaction capture(EMANIC) analysis that suggested the two-start zig-zag conformation and one-start solenoid structure with bent linker DNAs co-existed in a structurally heteromorphic chromatin fibers with a NRL of 2O7 bp [25].However,when the NRL variations were large,the resulting fibers were extremely polymorphic,including zig-zag structures,bent fibers,hairpin-like conformations and loops.

Our own cryo-EM structure revealed that the chromatin fibers with NRLs of 177 and 187 bp forms two-start lefthanded helical fibers,with diameters of $2 7 - 3 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ and a clear zig-zag conformation [28].However,recent experiments have shown that small NRLs deviations ( $^ { \\pm 2 }$ and $\\pm 4$ bp from the mean repeat) do not change significantly the foldingand compaction of chromatin [23,69].This shows that the intrinsic structure of the fiber must allow for several different repeat lengths (differing not only by 1On bp,where n is an integer) and accommodate a noninteger periodicity of the DNA helix $( 1 0 . 5 \\mathrm { b p / t u r n } )$ . To rotate the nucleosomesaway from theirpreferred angle to the axis,a high amount of energy would be required.The feasibility of any structure is expected to depend on the geometry of the DNA attachment to the nucleosomes.Differences in fiber structure due to changes in the entry/exit geometry may also arise in vivo through partial unwrapping of the nucleosomes,either byacetylation of histone tails[7O],the introduction of histone variants such as CENP-A [71]and H2A.Bbd [72]，or through the action of nucleosome remodeling complexes [73].Drastic alternation of nucleosome geometry might also occur if nucleosomes dissociate into hemisomes containing one copy of each histone protein,as reported for Drosophila centromeric nucleosomes [74]. In addition，EM experiments of reconstituted nucleosomes showed that a short stem was observed on the linker DNA of nucleosome [8,37].At present,it is not clear whether the size of the stem is constant or whether it depends on the NRL and the type of the bound linker histone.It has been shown that the globular domain of H1 plays important roles in maintaining the orientation of nucleosome discs relative to the fiber axis [75]. Thus,geometrical considerations for the fiber should allow for some differences between the actual linkerlengths and the real distances between consecutive nucleosomes.In addition,variegation effect studies in Drosophila have shown that gene silencing is accompanied by higher compaction, with nucleosomes being spaced more regularly [76]. Together, these results suggest that the nucleosome repeat lengths in vivo could also be defined by existing structural constrains such as nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and the binding of linker histone H1.

Similarly,acetylation of histone was found to decrease the overall stability of mononucleosomes only marginally[8O],but was shown to impair strongly the folding of oligonucleosome arrays into higher-order structures [1o.81,82].A threshold effect of acetylation was found in the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure,however,disruption of the folding of chromatin fiber was also observed with acetylation mimics located only on the H4 tail domain,and acetylation of H4K16 was shown to reduce $\\mathsf { M g C l } _ { 2 }$ -dependentarray foldingasmuchas acetylation at lysines 5,8,12,and 16 within the H4 tail [83-85]. Using in vitro reconstituted nucleosome arrays,it has previously been shown that in the absence of linker histone H1,acetylation of H4K16 results in a major unfolding of the reconstituted nucleosome arrays [85].Interestingly,this effect may be due to specific cation binding to the pocket within the H2A acidic patch, thought to be occupied by H4K16 in condensed chromatin structures [83].However,the molecular mechanisms involved in this process,as well as the precise details of the structure still remain unknown,more importantly,the potential role played by linker histones in this situation remains to be solved.Indeed,the effects of core histone acetylation on chromatin fiber folding in the presence of linker histone H1,seem to be minor [86] when compared to the unfolding that is observed in its absence [81]. In contrast, Robinson et al.[84] demonstrated that the histone H4 tail is essential for the compaction of nucleosome arrays into the $3 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ chromatin fiber.However,partial acetylation of K16 in the N-terminal tail of histone H4 strongly inhibits the formation of the $3 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ chromatin fiber to a greater degree than deletion of the H4N-terminal tail in the presence of a linker histone.

        "text": "The acidic patch on the surface of H2A and H2B was also shown to be involved in the formation of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber through interacting with H4 tails of adjacent nucleosome.Therefore,incorporation of non-allelic variants of the major core histone proteins, which can change the acidic patch,may also alter the folding and stability of higher-order chromatin structures [3].For example, the H2A variant H2A.Z possesses a patch that is more acidic than that of canonical H2A histone,due to the replacement of asparagine and lysine residues in the patch with aspartic acid and serine residues,respectively [87]. This intrinsic property of H2A.Z possibly contributes to the formation of more compact secondary structures than observed with arrays containing H2A [88,89],a property lost when the relevant residues are mutated back to that of H2A. Interestingly，the more acidic patch of H2A.Z also inhibits array self-association into tertiary structures,suggesting competing functions for the H4 tail domain. In contrast, the acidic patch of the H2A variant H2A.Bbd,which is associated with more actively transcribed regions of chromatin,is less acidic than canonical H2A and results in a less stably folded secondary structure that is more transcriptionally competent than that of H2A arrays [90]. In addition, the C-terminal tail of H2A has been shown to play an important role in the binding of the linker histone $\\mathsf { H } 1 / \\mathsf { H } 5$ with nucleosome cores,with the C-terminal tail of histone variant H2A.Z disfavoring H1 binding [50,65]. Therefore,H2A.Z also modulates the folding of chromatin fiber by weakening the binding of linker histone H1 [91]. Interestingly,we have also demonstrated that the incorporation of histone variant H3.3 can impair the compaction of chromatin fiber and counteract H2A.Z-mediated chromatin compaction through an unknown mechanism [89]. The Cterminal tail of H2A can also contact nucleosomal DNA near the center of the nucleosome core,but“shifts\"to contact DNA near the edge of the core region in nucleosomes and oligonucleosomal structures containing the linker DNA [92]. Therefore,it would be interesting to study whether the modification of C-terminal tail of histone H2A,such as ubiquitination of H2AK119,can modulate the folding of the chromatin fiber. In addition,H1-H1 interaction (most likely through its global domains）was also found to be important for stabilizing the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber,thus the modifications of global domains of $\\mathsf { H } 1 / \\mathsf { H } 5$ could provide a new mechanism for the epigenetic regulation of the compaction of the chromatin fiber.Indeed,the citrullination of Arg54,which results in the loss of a positive charge and a gain in hydrogen-bonding ability,can impair the compaction of chromatin fiber by reducing the binding of H1 to nucleosome,and probably also lowering the strength of interaction between H1-H1 [93]. In addition, phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain(CTD) of histone H1 has been shown to be involved in metaphase chromatin condensation and in interphase chromatin relaxation through charge neutralization [94] and effects on secondary structure of CTD [95]. Similarly, phosphorylation at Ser27 in the N-terminal tail of histone H1 was shown to regulate the mobility and binding of H1 to condensed mitotic chromatin[96]. Of note,higher eukaryotes containa number of linker histone variants(about 11） that possess C-terminal tails that diverge considerably in their primary AA sequence [31]. The functions of linker histone H1 and its isoforms in the formation ofhigher-order chromatin structure and gene regulation have been extensively discussed elsewhere [31,32].However，how the sequence variations of linker histones (e.g. the two species of H1 and H5 in chicken erythrocytes),or the posttranslational modifications of the H1 influence the stability of the higher-order structure aswell as the accessibility of the linker DNA still remains largely unknown.

Another class of nucleosome-associated interactions that affect higher-order chromatin structure is mediated by non-histone chromatin-associated proteins [3].Therefore,there must exist alternative secondary structures of condensed chromatin,with or without H1 histone,resulting from the interaction with non-histone“architectural”factors and other trans-acting factors,such as HMGNs,PcG proteins,MENT, ${ \\mathrm { M e C P } } _ { 2 }$ ，MBT proteins and HP1 [3].Several chromatin-associated proteins have shown to play a direct role in the formation and/or maintenance of repressive chromatin fiber,including the polycomb group protein PRC1 and PRC2 [103,104],MENT [105],MeCP2 [106]. On the other hand,both malignant-brain-tumor(MBT) proteins[1O7] and heterochromatin protein 1(HP1）[108,109],which can specifically recognize and bind to methylated histone tails,compact nucleosomal arrays in a manner dependent on histone methylations.It would be interesting to perform structural analysis of reconstituted chromatin complexesconsisting ofH3K9andH4K20methylation heterochromatin markers and interacting proteins,such as HP1 and MBT proteins [61].

Similarly,MBT proteins and the condensin I complex have been shown to condense chromatin through binding to the monomethylated lysine 2O of histone H4 tails[1O7,111].Therefore,MBT proteinsand condensin I complex mayalso play an important role in regulating the formation of chromatin fiber via interfering with the interactions between H4 tails and the acidic patches present between tetranucleosomal units during mitosis.

One earlier study also provided strong evidence for the presence ofa $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber structure,even after high-pressure freezing and thin section of vitreous material [114]. Most recently,using cryoelectron tomography of vitreous sections of chicken erythrocyte chromatin in nuclei,Frangakis and colleagues showed that the most predominant form of chromatin in chicken erythrocyte nuclei is indeed a $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber.Importantly，these fibers were observed to be arranged in a two-start helix formation,with approximately 6.7 nucleosomes per turn,in which the nucleosomes are juxtaposed face-to-face.The stacked nucleosomes were shown to be shifted off their superhelical axes,with an axial translation of approximately $3 . 4 \\mathrm { n m }$ and an azimuthal rotation of approximately $5 4 ^ { \\circ }$ [58].Intriguingly,this geometry strongly resembles the structure of the tetranucleosome [24],and also resembles our 3D cryo-EM structure,which revealed a $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber composed of a left-handed two-strand double helix consisting of tetranucleosomal units [28]. Furthermore,electron tomograms of plunge-frozen isolated chromatin from chicken erythrocyte in both open and compacted forms were recorded.Frangakis and colleagues found that in compact chromatin,the nucleosomes are arranged ina predominant faceto-face stacking(mainly as doublet stacks) organization [58,117].

The in vivo existence of face-to-face nucleosome stacking is also supported by a peak in the $5 . 5 \\mathrm { - } 6 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ range,as observed previously in the Xray scattering profile of interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes[118].Together,this body of experimental evidence strongly suggests that stacking interactions of nucleosomes are an important mechanism for generating chromatin compaction both in vitro and in vivo.

To determine the nucleosomenucleosome interaction in chromatin with a longer NRL,the chromatin isolated from starfish (Patiria miniata） spermatozoids, which contains exceptionally long NRL of 222 bp,was analyzed. It has been hypothesized that the chromatin fibers with longer NRL adopt a different conformation from that of fibers containing short NRLs [16].This study showed that the predominant form of chromatin compaction in starfish spermatozoids is also face-toface stacking,with the nucleosomes organized in a “double-track\" conformation,even though the overall fiber structure was different to the compact chicken erythrocyte chromatin[117].However, the larger azimuthal rotation in the fiber results in a more homogeneous nucleosome distribution when compared to the idealized cross-linker model,where stacked nucleosomes form two dense gyres that are widely separated in both cases.Close face-to-face nucleosome stackings have previously been demonstrated in various crystal structures [2,24].In the contrast,a center-to-center distance of stacked nucleosomes in situ is approximately $1 0 . 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ leavinga large distance ofat least $3 \\mathrm { n m }$ between the two octamer cores,which is much larger than that reported in crystal structures [58].This binding distance excludes core-to-core interactions but allows interactions mediated by histone N-terminal tails in a tailto-core interaction.It is of great interest to note that different face-to-face juxtaposition of nucleosomes was observed in our 3D cryo-EM structure of 30-nm fiber [28].The center-to-center distance between the nucleosome stacks within tetranucleosomal unit is close enough to allow the core-to-core interactions mediated by H2A/H2B four helix bundles,however,a much larger gap was observed between the tetranucleosomal unit in our structure of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber and it excludes the above mentioned core-to-core interactions,but allows interactions mediated by H4 tails-acidic patch on the neighboring nucleosomes [28].In addition to the chicken erythrocyte and starfish spermatozoid,a recent study showed that the facultative heterochromatin on the mouse rod photoreceptor cell also contains a $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber organization [119].

Early DNase Ianalysis suggested that the linker DNA and linker histone is buried deep inside the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiber,which is in agreement with previously published reports using other techniques[12O-122].In addition,digestion of whole nuclei with DNase I or DNase II produces a series of DNA fragments,the length of which is a multiple of the duplicate length of the nucleosome DNA repeat in nuclei of various origins (Avian erythrocytes and sperm of sea urchin）[123-125].This unusual dinucleosomal periodicity of DNase I digestion pattern implies the existence of a particular structural unit that consists of at least 2 nucleosomes,which is to some extent in agreement with our 3D cryo-EM3O-nm fiber structure,where tetranucleosomes are found to be the repeating structural unit [28]. Interestingly,dinucleosomal symmetry of the higher-order chromatin structure has been shown previously to be independent of nucleosome repeat length [56,123,124]. With the recent development of deep sequencing techniques,it is now possible to map the location of the structural units（comprised of dinucleosomes or tetranucleosomes）across thewhole genome.In addition,DNase I digestion also results in an asymmetrical protection of nucleosomes in nuclei,which suggests that the vast majority of nucleosomes has an alternating orientation and asymmetrical organization in vivo [56,123-125]. The alternating orientations of nucleosomes in the fiber may result from criss-crossing linkers.Intriguingly,our 3D cryo-EM analysis indicates the presence of a twisted helical fiber structure containing alternately tilted nucleosomes [28],which would provide an explanation for the observed DNase results.In contrast to artificial arrays,which are of defined nucleosome repeat length and uniform histone composition,native chromatin has inherent local variationsin nucleosome repeat length,modifications and variants of the core and linker histones.Despite this variability,native chromatin shows remarkable structural regularity,as observed in the reconstituted compact $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fibers in vitro.

Although theyused a powerful combination of cryo-electron microscopy and image processing, Dubochet and colleagues could not find any regular $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fibers within mitotic chromosomes in situ[112].Also,recent studies using SAXS (Small angle X-ray scattering) analysis combined with computational modeling were unable to detect regular structural features that were larger than $1 1 \\mathrm { n m }$ in the interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes [128,129]. As discussed above,phosphorylations of histone H1 and monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 2O have been shown to regulate the formation of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiberthrough different mechanisms [94-96,1O7,111]. Interestingly,both phosphorylations of H1 and monomethylation of H4 lysine 2O were found to be peak in M phase [96,111], therefore,it is reasonable to speculate that the 30-nm chromatin fiber may be disrupted in mitotic chromosomes by these modifications on histone H1 and histone H4 tails.In addition，using cryo-EM tomography to study the picoplankton Ostreococcus tauri,Gan et al. found that O. tauri chromatin resembles a disordered assembly of nucleosomes,without any indication of the presence of structures resembling the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber[13O]. Using another EM-based imaging method called electron-spectroscopic imaging (ESI)，Bazett-Jones et al. found that pluripotent mouse cells contain highly dispersed meshes of 10- nm fibers.Again,no 3O-nm fibers were found in the various types of mouse cells,even in the condensed domains of heterochromatin regions [127,131,132]. Thus,strong evidence for the presence of ordered hierarchical folding (as a general mechanism for chromatin compaction）across the different model systems remains conspicuously absent. ",

        "text": "Our 3D cryo-EM structure of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber provides an excellent starting point for the elucidation of the fundamental structural aspectsofthe elusive $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatinfiber. However,due to the relative low resolution of approximate $1 1 \\mathring { \\mathsf { A } }$ the precise details about the various interactions,either between nucleosome stacks within tetranucleosomal units or between H1-H1 of different units,remain to be elucidated.With recent advances in direct electron detection and image processing, the resolution of cryo-EManalysis is now beginning to rival X-ray crystallography [133]. Thus,the resolving of the structure of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber at a higher resolution by using the new electron detector and imaging processing is now imminent. Such high-resolution structure will provide much-needed structural details for a better understanding of the interactions between nucleosome-nucleosome as well as H1-H1.This will undoubtedly advance our insights into the functions of the tails of both core histoneand linker histone H1 in the formation of $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber.In addition,our 3D cryo-EM structure of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ fiberimplies that the large gap present at the interface between tetranucleosomal units,which is mediated by the interactions of H4 tails and acidic patches on neighboring nucleosome,provide an excellent platform forepigenetic factors/mechanisms to modulate the folding of the chromatin fiber.It would be of great interest to determine the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of reconstituted chromatin fiber containing histone variants or histones carrying different histone modifications.As discussed above,the C-terminus of H2A has important functions in the formation of higher-order chromatin structure,thus it will also be of interest to investigate whether the histone modifications on histone H2A C-tail (such as monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine119）and histone H2A variants with different C-tail (such as macroH2A and H2A.X) can affect the compaction of chromatin fiber.Regarding the variation of NRL in vivo,the reconstitutes with a combination of different NRLs will be also a good candidate for cryo-EM study in the future.These further studies will not only enhance our understanding of the functions of histone modifications and variants in epigenetic regulation of chromatin compaction,but also provide an opportunity to find novel structural features within the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber.Crucially,some chromatin modifications may have no direct effect on the structure of chromatin fiber,but they might instead modulate the chromatin structure indirectly, presumably by recruitingchromatin interacting factorsapart from linker histones such as HP1,MeCP2 and MBT proteins.Deciphering the structural role of these additional chromatin binding proteins in different chromatin contexts (i.e.different modifications) would also be of tremendous importance.Recently，single-molecule approaches have been applied to investigate the dynamics of chromatin fiber folding[68,134], thus it would be interesting to study the force and the potential epigenetic regulations involved in different nucleosome-nucleosome interactions (intra- or inter-tetranucleosomal units) during the step-wise folding and unfolding of the $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber.

        "text": "Another important question is how much the structural results from the in vitro studies mirror the structure of the actual\"native\" $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fiber? To solve this puzzle,the study of the organization of chromatin will require the development of advanced techniques.Previously，cryo-EM studies in mammalian cells revealed no existence of regular $3 0 \\mathrm { - n m }$ chromatin fibers in mitotic and interphase chromosomes in human and mouse cells [112]. Cryo-EM can examine biological sample in close to their native states,however,itis limited by the fact that onlya small portion of the sample can be detected [112]. However, the recent development of coherent X-ray diffraction imaging(CXDI) has made it possible to visualize a single chromosome using $\\mathsf { X } .$ -rays [129].In addition,X-ray free electron lasers(XFELs）have been developed thatproduce high peak-brilliance coherent hard X-rays. Potentially,a combination of CXDI and XFELswill allow the visualization of chromosomes at a resolution within the nanometer range.To visualize and quantify the ultrastructure of cryopreserved cells,two other combinatorial methods,the combination of Soft X-ray tomography(SXT） with cryogenic confocal fluorescence tomography（CFT)[135] and the combination of cryo-EM with super resolution fluorescence imaging techniques,have been developed recently.It is to be expected that by the application of these combinational imaging techniques in the future,more structural details for the organization of chromatin fiber can be obtained in situ.
