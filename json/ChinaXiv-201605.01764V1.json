The currently most popular possible extension of the Standard Model is the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) which not only can account for all existing precision electroweak mesurements but also predicts a whole host of new particles and decays waiting to be observed. In its simplest form the MSSM has a global symmetry $R$ -parity [1], defined by $R = ( - 1 ) ^ { 2 S + 3 B + L }$ with spin $S$ , baryon-number $B$ and lepton-number $L$ which is implemented in such a way as to conserve both $B$ and $L$ seperately. However,there is no fundamental requirement for $R$ conservation, indeed it is known that instanton effects induce miniscule violations of both $B$ and $L$ [2]. Thus if SUSY is discovered and $R$ -parity turns out to be conserved,it is conceivable that some hitherto unidentified fundamental principle is at work. Hence $R$ -parity violation should be vigorously searched for. ",

[3],although many such couplings have been severely constrained, existing bounds on the top quark couplings are generally quite weak.

In what follows, we study the feasibility of detecting $B$ violating $R$ -parity interactions (i.e. $\\lambda ^ { ^ { \\prime \\prime } }$ couplings only） in top production and decay in $e ^ { + } e ^ { - }$ collisions at $\\sqrt { s } = 5 0 0 ~ G e V$ .Given that projected luminosities are large enough to produce tens of thousands of $\\bar { t } t$ pairs in a relatively clean environment [4], it is reasonable to expect that either $R$ -parity violating SUSY will be discovered or the parameter space further restricted.
