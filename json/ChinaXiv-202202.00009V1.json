        "text": "Moral courage, standing up for others and intervening when a norm is violated, is viewed as a virtue in modern societies. However, it remains unclear how moral courage varies in interpersonal relationships and across moral contexts. Two studies were designed to test the effect of relationship type (close or distant) between the bystander and the victim on moral courage across harm/care and fairness contexts. The results showed that participants reported greater levels of moral courage when the victim was their family member or friend (vs. a stranger),and this relationship effect was stronger in the harm/care (vs. fairness) context. In addition, anger, a moral emotion, served a mediation role in the relationship effect on moral courage in both moral contexts. Taken together, the current findings demonstrate a relationship effect on the intentions of moral courage,especially in the harm/care context, suggesting that the relationship (between bystander and victim) and the context (harm/care vs. fairness) should be considered in understanding interventions against a norm violation.

        "text": "Modern societies suffer from violence and conflicts, which often challenge human rights and may lead to social crises. Standing up courageously against these violations is strongly desired and regarded as basic competence in democracy (Edelstein & Fauser, 2001； Spini & Doise,1998). Moral courage involves intervention against a norm violation or standing up for moral values (Baumert, Halmburger, & Schmitt, 2013; Greitemeyer et al., 2O06). While some people stand up and intervene despite the high personal risk of negative consequences, others do not. Previous research has identified dispositional factors that drive moral courage， such as justicesensitivity, conscientiousness,and moral emotions (Baumert, Halmburger,& Schmitt， 2013; Halmburger et al., 2O15), whereas the purpose of the current research was to examine relational factors and underlying processes of moral courage (Brandstatter et al., 2016). Past findings related to helping behavior and intervention in cases of an attack indicate the importance of the perceived relationships between the bystander, the perpetrator, and the victim (Bennet et al.,2017; Bennet & Banyard, 2016; Shotland & Straw, 1976), as well as contextual cues that indicate the severity of the harm or the cost of helping (Banyard,2011; Chabot et al., 2009; Burn,2009; Fisher et al., 2006).

Second, we hypothesized that anger, a typical moral emotion，would serve as an underlying mechanism in this effect and tested its role as a mediator between relationship type and moral courage. Third, considering the distinction between harm/care related violations, which involve suffering of close kin, and fairness related violations,which involve reciprocal altruism among unrelated individuals (Haidt & Graham, 2007),we hypothesized that the effect of relationship type (close Vs. distant relationship with the victim) on anger and subsequent moral courage would be stronger in the harm/care—compared with the fairness-context.

In this vein, researchers began to explore the motive of moral courage, such as moral responsibilities, moral dispositions, and moral concerns (Baumert, Halmburger,& Schmitt, 2O13; Dungan, Young,& Waytz, 2019; Pouwels, van Noorden,& Caravita, 2019). It should be noted that, however, redressing norms requires confronting a wrongdoer, which may involve interpersonal risk,it is important to consider relationship features in a morally courageous situation.

        "text": "In fact, a key point of bystander theory suggests that the relationship between the bystander and the victim has an impact on the likelihood that the bystander will intervene (Latané & Darley, 197O). From a reciprocal point of view (Gouldner,1960), individuals tend to feel more responsible for helping close others than strangers,as they are more likely to return such favors, since otherwise they would be considered ungrateful or“free-loaders\". In addition, a close relationship was also expected to lead to higher moral courage compared to a distant relationship,also given that both moral courage and helping behavior are prosocial behaviors that share many attributes, although the focus of moral courage is on the perpetrator while the focus of the helping behavior is on the victim. Such relationship effect is supported in the literature regarding helping in everyday life: having a closer relationship (e.g., friendship, more contact, in-group membership) with a victim was found to increase helping behavior in a variety of less risky situations for the bystander, such as contributing to medical research, intervening if someone stole a book (Bell, 2Oo1), and offering financial and political help to the victims of natural disaster (Levine,& Thompson, 2O04). Moreover, another study found that, in the context of school bullying,adolescents were more likely to help a victim if s/he was a friend than a general classmate or an unknown person (Bellmore et al.,2012). In fact, Bennett et al. (2017) used vignettes to experimentally test the effect of the relationship between the bystander and the victim on the intent to help in situations of sexual violence, but the study produced mixed results, stressing the need to conduct further studies to explore the effect of the relational factor on the bystander's courageous act.

        "text": "Another purpose of this study was to identify the emotional drive underlying moral courage. Lazarus's (2oo1） appraisal theory conceptualizes appraisal， emotion, and action as the means by which people cope with events in their social world. In coping with moral violations, previous studies suggested that moral anger is a driving factor of moral courage, in comparison with guilt and global mood (Baumert et al.,2014; Greitemeyer et al., 2006; Kayser et al., 2010). The rationale is that anger about norm violation helps bystanders to overcome the psychological barrier related to the potential negative consequences of the intervention. However, most of the previous research considered moral anger as triggered by perceptions and judgment of the perpetrator and overlooked the possibility that the level of anger might vary as a function of the relationship type between the bystander and the victim. Nevertheless,in one study, individuals felt a greater level of anger regarding perceived mistreatment of their ingroup when their in-group identification was higher (Mackie et al., 2O04), and such anger was expected to predict collective actions in confronting a wrongdoer (e.g., van Zomeren et al., 2004; Yzerbyt et al., 2003). In the same vein, we argue that such an emotion-driven process also occurs in an interpersonal context. That is, witnessing injustice occurring to someone close (vs. distal) to the bystander instigates a higher level of anger, which further promotes the likelihood of a bystander intervening. ",

        "text": "In moral psychology, harm/care and fairness or reciprocity represent the two main aspects of interpersonal treatment (Haidt, 2O07). From a developmental standpoint, both harm/care and fairness/reciprocity characterize universal forms of human experiences and relationships, corresponding to the two basic processes of the evolution of morality: kin selection (development of a sensitivity to the needs and suffering of close kin) and reciprocal altruism (development of a sensitivity to who deserves what), respectively (Haidt, 2Oo7). In particular, the principle of harm/care derives primarily from moral concerns in close relationships (e.g., parent-child attachment), while the principle of fairness captures moral concerns of equality and cooperation, especially among people who are not closely related (Gilligan & Attanucci, 1988).

From the perspective of moral foundations,both harm/care and fairness are universally endorsed over other values (Haidt, 2007; Graham et al.， 2009). However, since care-related norms play a more critical role in the survival of human beings,compared with fairnessrelated norms, perception of care and suffering might be a universal template and thus the most significant aspect for all moral judgments (Gray et al., 2014). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a care-related violation (e.g., a physical or verbal attack) will be considered a more severe violation of morality compared with a fairness-related violation (e.g., unequal payment). Consequently, we expected people to show greater levels of moral courage when the victim is treated harmfully rather than unfairly, particularly when the violations occur to close others. ",

Three major findings were demonstrated across two studies. First, there was a relationship-type effect on moral courage, indicating that close relationships (compared to distant relationships) between a bystander and a victim lead to higher levels of moral courage. This effect was found when the victim was a family member (mother, Study 1) and a close friend (Study 2), suggesting a relationship effect beyond that of kinship. Second, and more importantly, we distinguished between two contexts of norm violations that involve harm/care and fairness,and found that the relationship-type effect was more potent in moral context of harm/care. Third, we found that the effect of relationship type on moral courage was mediated by moral emotion (anger). As a whole， this research consistently demonstrated that a close (vs. distant) relationship with a victim arouses greater anger, which in turn increases the bystander's intention to intervene against norm violations.

Despite the fact that we extended the relationship effect on moral courage beyond the scope of kinship, some claim that kinship is the most valued of all interpersonal relationships (Schneider, 1980). For example, previous research has shown that the ethical system in traditional China is based on close-knit community ties, kinship ties, such that people are easily to be disregarded in moral context even if they are cordial with their non-kin associates (Yan, 2O11). However, the current findings challenge this notion.

The bystanders reported more anger when they had a close relationship with the victim,replicating effects in previous studies in which individuals felt a greater level of anger about the perceived mistreatment of their in-group (Mackie et al.， 2Oo4)，and such anger predicted confrontation with the perpetrator (e.g., Yzerbyt et al., 2003).

Specifically, both studies indicated that anger played a different role in moral context of harm/care and fairness. Moral anger fully mediated the effect of relationship type on moral courage in the fairness context, but only partially mediated the effect in the harm/care context. Thus, the present study suggests that other factors might explain the effect of relationship type on moral courage in the harm/care context. While anger toward the perpetrator may be the exclusive moral emotion generated when a victim is economically deprived or treated unfairly, a victim that is physically or verbally harmed may also trigger other emotions, such as empathy or fear. Although previous studies found little evidence for an effect of empathy on moral courage (Baumert, Halmburger, & Schmitt, 2013; Kayser et al., 2010), this may depend on the specific moral context of the research (e.g., harm or fairness).

First, the current research focused on the relationship between the bystander and victim,but this effect might also depend on the relationships between the other parties (i.e., victim and perpetrator, perpetrator and bystander). Therefore, future studies should examine whether there are additional effects related to the relationship types of the other parties and whether these effects modify the effect of the relationship between the bystander and victim on moral courage. Second, since anger did not fully mediate the effect of relationship type on moral courage in the care/harm context, it would be useful to investigate the role of additional moral emotions (e.g., empathy) and psychological process that can lead to moral courage (Halmburger, Baumert, & Schmitt, 2014). Third, the current research utilized a methodology that involved hypothetical scenarios and measured intentions to intervene, due to the ethical issues that may arise from facilitating interpersonal transgressions and observing the degree to which perceived harm and anger lead a bystander to confront or not confront a perpetrator. While intentions have been shown to be strong determinants of intervention behavior, future studies should nevertheless attempt replicating the current findings by using realistic situation and behavioral measures (Baumert, Halmburger, & Schmitt, 2013). For example, a natural experiment might use an observation of a person yelling at one participant's family or friend in realistic situations,and examine the degree of intervention, if any, of the participant.

The current research found that people are more willing to stand up against a perpetrator when the victim is a close friend or a family member, compared to a stranger. This draws attention to parallels processes between moral courage and other prosocial behaviors (e.g., helping behavior, Bell et al., 2001; Levine et al., 2Oo5). Moreover, this effect was found to be stronger when the moral norm was in the context of harm/care (vs. fairness), with corresponding anger levels over the moral violation. While anger fully explained the effect on moral courage in the fairness context, additional moral emotions should be considered when moral context involves care. This unique context-dependent effect highlights the importance of the current findings and offers concrete objectives for future research. Taken together, this research demonstrates the importance of close relationship for interventions against a norm violation across moral contexts, suggesting that a relational approach should be considered when restoring moral values and mobilizing moral behavior.
