        "text": "The study of unbound or loosely bound exotic nuclei casts a new light on the discovery of nuclear halo structure [1]. The valence nucleons can be readily scattered into singleparticle resonant orbitals in the continuum. Due to the small binding energy and small or no centrifugal barrier conditions, the valence nucleons tunnel out of the potential barrier to long distances with an extended density tail to form the so-called halos. Therefore, the resonant orbitals in the continuum and the coupling between bound states and the continuum near the threshold play an important role in the description of halo phenomena [2, 3]. In most calculations, the continuum is replaced by a set of positive energy orbitals without the contributions of the widths,determined by solving the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB） or relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) equations in coordinate space and with box boundary conditions [4, 5]. Taking into account of the contributions from bound states and resonant orbitals in the continuum,the resonant Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach based on the relativistic mean field theory (RMF-rBCS) [6-10] is applied to describe the properties of neutron-rich nuclei.

As is well known, the results of the RMF $^ +$ BCS approach (i.e., the conventional BCS approach) change with the box size because of the inclusion of the spurious orbitals. As opposed to the RMF $^ +$ BCS approach, the results of the RMF $^ +$ ACCC $^ +$ BCS approach are invariable for the specified pairing window,which is from all the bound states below the Fermi surface to one harmonic oscillator shell resonant orbitals above the Fermi surface. Therefore, only the binding energies obtained from the RMF and the RMF $^ +$ ACCC $^ +$ BCS approaches are shown in Tab. I. The available experimental binding energy for $^ { 1 7 }$ Ne is 112.9276 MeV and that for $^ { 1 5 }$ O is 111.955 MeV [35]. An asterisk denotes the result of the RMF $^ +$ ACCC $^ +$ BCS calculation without resonant width contribution. In this case, the resonant orbitals are simplified by the discrete positive orbitals without the widths. It can be seen from Tab.I that the results without width effect are larger than those with widths contributions because of the over evaluation of the pairing correlation, which is also mentioned in Ref.[9]. The binding energies in the RMF $^ +$ ACCC $^ +$ BCS calculations are $1 \\%$ larger than experimental data. The two-proton separation energy S for $^ { 1 7 }$ Ne is 0.93 MeV, and the corresponding theoretical $2 p$   \nresult is O.2 (0.14) MeV for the NL3 (NLSH) effective interaction. The values of S $z p$ in our calculations are smaller than data, but those at least tell us $^ { 1 7 }$ Ne is a weakly bound nucleus, which can not be seen from the RMF calculations. The binding energy for $^ { 1 5 }$ O is larger than that for $^ { 1 7 }$ Ne in the RMF calculations, which means $^ { 1 7 }$ Ne is unstable against proton emission if pairing correlations are not taken into account. In the RMF $^ +$ ACCC $^ +$ BCS calculations, the binding energy for $^ { 1 5 }$ O is less than that for $^ { 1 7 }$ Ne,which means the valence protons are weakly bound in $^ { 1 7 }$ Ne because of the attractive pairing correlations.

The results of the RMF approach are also shown for comparison with the results of the RMF $^ +$ ACCC $+$ BCS approach. It can be seen that the energies of the bound states in the RMF calculations are slightly different from those in the RMF $^ +$ ACCC $^ +$ BCS calculations because the self-consistent potential of the latter is not the same as the former.For protons, the bound orbitals 1s $1 / 2$ ， $1$ p $3 / 2$ ， $1$ p $_ { 1 / 2 }$ ， as well as the resonant orbitals $1 \\mathrm { d } _ { 5 / 2 }$ and $\\mathrm { 2 s _ { 1 / 2 } }$ with narrow widths, have a similar structure for the NL3 and NLSH efective interactions.
