Conventional magnets are generallycomposedof rigid materials which may face challenges in extreme situations.Here,froman alternative other than rigid magnet, we proposed forthe first time to generate fluidic endogenous magnetismand construct magnetic monopole through tuning liquid metal machine.Basedontheoretical interpretationandconceptual experimental evidences,we ilustrated that when gallumbase liquid metal insolution rotatesunder electrical actuation,it formsan endogenous magnetic field inside which wel explains the phenomenon that two such discrete metal droplets could easily fuse together,indicating their reciprocal attraction via $\\mathbf { N }$ and S poles.Further, we clarified that the self-fueled liquid metal motor also runs as an endogenous fluidic magnet owning electromagnetic homology.When liquid gallium in solution swallowed aluminum inside,it formed a spin motor and dynamicallyvariable charge distribution which produced endogenous magnetism inside.This explains the phenomena that there often happened refletion collsion and attraction fusion betwee running liquid metal motors which were just caused by the dynamic adjustment of their $\\mathbf { N }$ and S polarities,respectively. Finally,we conceived that such endogenous magnet could lead to magnetic monopole and four technicalroutes torealize this object were thus suggested as:1.Matching interiorflowofliquid metal machines;2.Superpositionbetween external electric effectand magnetic field; 3.Composite construction between magnetic particlesand liquid metal motor; 4.Chemical ways such as via galvanic cel reaction. Overall the present theory and revealed experimental evidences disclosed the role of liquid metal machine as a fluidic endogenous magnet and pointed out some promising ways to realize magnetic monopole.A group of unconventional magnetoelectric devices and applications can be possible in the near future.

The above motion wil generate tiny circular currents. According to Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, electricity and magnetism are induced by each other. These tiny circular currents will induce a corresponding magnetic field.

Generally, their shape and structure cannot be changed on the eigen-scale, which makes the applications somewhat limited.In order to improve the adaptability of the magnet to different situations,people have invented the magnetic fluid functional material, which is a colloidal solution formed by surface active agentencapsulated nanomagnetic particles dispersed in the base fluid[13l,and can exhibit special magnetic and optical properties. Although the fluidity has been enhanced, the part that exhibits magnetism has not deviated from the essence of the rigid magnet.Recently,as a base fluid material for loading magnetic nanoparticles,liquid metal has been gradually developed as multi-functional materials due to its outstanding electrical and thermal conductivity and ductility. Its excellent deformability allows droplets to adapt to paths of different sizes.In particular,the chemical properties of room temperature liquid eutectic alloys such as GaIn and GaInSn are relatively stable under normal conditions. Their low toxicity and good operability allow researchers to adjust the alloy ratio to achieve various melting points and characteristics,so as to be competent for tasks that rigid materials cannot do.

The orientation of the magnet will cause a change in the motion state of the droplet. Even when the position of the droplet is unknown,the magnet can attract the liquid metal to achieve rapid control. However, the story will not just end there.Here, we conceived that on a microscopic level, the spherical liquid metal droplet in fact formed a weak endogenous magnetic field when excited by its own circular current or an external current during the rotation process. This rapidly rotating liquid metal droplet not only owns the magnetic properties of rigid materials, but also flows like water. It belongs to a new kind of magnetic matter, or termed as fluidic magnet. ",

The magnetic field lines are emited from the N pole outside the magnet and then return to the S pole, and inside the magnet,the S pole points to the N pole,forming countless closed circuits.This fixed pattern of magnetic field distribution limits the routes to verify the actual existence of magnetic monopoles. So far,the magnetic monopoles only appear as quasi-particles in condensed mater, such as the flipping excitation of spin icel16-18l,and the similar structure produced by the vortex of super-cold rubidium atoms in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)[19]. However, we realized that as a variable fluidic conductor, the liquid metal machine generates a constantly changing endogenous magnetic field in the random spin motion. When an external electric or magnetic field is superimposed, or compounding with magnetic particles,or just artificially modifying the magnetic field through internal chemical reactions,even much diverse magnetic field configurations or behaviors will be generated. This is fundamentally different from the conventional rigid magnetic material with fixed-poles.This article is dedicated to present a new conceptual fluidic magnet and provide several possible technical routes towards finding the magnetic monopoles.

Especially, the excellent electric conductivity of such matters molds them into intrinsically conductive fluid.

        "text": "Compared with Maxwell's equations, which originally did not consider the existence of magnetic monopoles,the two differential equations related to the magnetic field have changed. Since the movement of the magnetic monopole may also excite the electric field,the magnetic current density vector $J _ { m }$ is introduced into the Equation (12) to obtain the Equation (3O). At the same time, the magnetic monopole can excite the magnetic field by itself,and the divergence of the magnetic field is no longer zero (Equation 31). The equations will show a more symmetrical electromagnetic field excitation form. Under the new category of liquid metal magnetic monopole which is fluidically tunable via diverse options, many theoretical and experimental works are worthy of pursuing in the coming time. ",

Figure 14B refers to a soft magnetic substance, which can be attached to a specific substrate. This magnetic material has been applied to various electronic devices,such as sensors and flexible circuits.Figure 14Cis a composite of magnetic nanoparticles and fluid proposed in recent years. This fluid has no magnetic atraction in static state,and only exhibits magnetism when an external magnetic field is applied.It has a wide range of applications in the fields of medical equipment, magnetic fluid beneficiation, but is still not an ideal all-magnetic fluid. Stepping further, the rotating liquid metal machine or motor as proposed in this work belongs to a new kind of magnetic fluid,or electromagnefluid,as shown in Figure 14D. In this category,there is no need to add additional magnetic particles, which is a complete magnetic fluid in the true sense. The discovery of room temperature liquid metal full magnetic fluid wil bring new visions and directions for research in diverse fields, which has profound significance for the academic society to further understand magnets and fully use them.

Cut a magnet into two pieces, and each piece will form its own north and south poles,which makes it difficult to achieve the existence of one pole alone. Compared with traditional rigid magnets,the advantage of liquid metal lies in its fluidity，which makes it easier to adjust to different shapes and the restriction on particle movement is reduced. While the surface charges are moving fast,the inside of the fluid is constantly rotating, making the surrounding magnetic field in a state of constant change. If the single charge on the surface of the liquid metal can be manipulated, even controlling the positive and negative features of the charge in a certain position, then the direction of a single magnetic particle can be reversed, it is possible to construct a liquid metal magnetic monopole.

        "text": "Liquid metal can interact with sound,light, heat, electricity and magnetism etc. The present study disclosed for the first time that as a fluidic conductor,liquid metal machine opens a generalized way to generate transformable endogenous magnet through tuning its interior rotational configurations. This mechanism is rather difficult to implement through rigid materials otherwise.It may change people's basic understanding of the classical magnetism science. A most noteworthy tool enabled from this finding still lies in that such fluidic magnet suggested a new promising way to realize magnetic monopole in reality. And the fundamental routes can be based on either self-fueled liquid metal motor or the electrically controlled spin motion of liquid metal machine inside the electrolyte. Meanwhile，it should also be pointed out that，such liquid metal endogenous magnetism is fundamentally different from the conventional magnetic fluids which was in fact caused by the magnetic particles rather than the fluid itself.This raised important fundamental and practical issues waiting to be addressed in the coming time.It also opens perspective for making new conceptual liquid machines which may find some emerging uses in future basic physics,information technology, smart devices,and advanced functional materials. Overall,the reasonable conjecture as made on the classical mystery whether magnetic monopole exists or not would shed light to innovate future science and engineering. ",
