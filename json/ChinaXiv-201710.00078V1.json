Among these gas sensors,metal oxide semiconductor (MOS） sensors are widely investigated because of their high sensitivity，low cost， and easy maintenance.1 Seiyama et al. initially proposed the principle of gas sensing in 1962.² Consequently，various kinds of MOS have been explored as gas sensors. Samples of $n$ -type metal oxides are $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ $\\mathrm { I n } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ ，and $\\mathbf { W O } _ { 3 }$ .

Among candidate gas sensor nanomaterials, $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ has been extensively investigated given its high conductivity， good stability，and biological friendliness4.5However， several drawbacks,such as high operating temperature,low sensitivity, and selectivity,still limit the application of bulk $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ as gas sensor.Numerous studies have been conducted to improve the gas sensing performance of $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ by designing different $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ nanostructures with large surface areas to increase active sites, such as nanocactus, porous nanoflakes,7.8 and flower-like structures.9,10 Combining noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) (i.e., Au，Ag，or $\\mathrm { \\mathbf { P } t }$ ）with $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ to form hybrid nanostructures is anotherefficientstrategytoacquiredesirablesensing performance.11-14 Two types of noble metal $\\mathrm { N P - Z n O }$ hybrid nanostructures,namely,surface modified and encapsulated,are currently employed and generally designed to improve the sensing performance.15-21 The gas sensing performance of sensors can be enhanced by surface modification because of the catalytic effects of the noble metal NPs in the dissociation of molecularoxygen (chemical sensitization） and electronic interaction for the formation of Schottky junctions between noble metal NPs and $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ (electronic sensitization).However, this approach is still limited by several issues.Coagulation and chemical poisoning of noble metal NPs occur at high working temperature,resulting in the lossof catalytic activity.22,23 By contrast,encapsulated noble metal NPs are more stable than that on the surface because of the protection of the surrounding ",

        "text": "Selectivity of gas sensor materials is highly significant in practical application.The selectivity of the pure $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ NSbased or $\\mathtt { A u - Z n O }$ NS-based sensor toward ethanol was evaluated by testing the sensors against various toxic gases, namely，methanol，formaldehyde，acetone,diethyl ether, benzene,toluene,and chlorobenzene.The responses of both sensors towards $1 0 0 \\mathrm { p p m }$ of different gases at $3 6 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $3 2 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathbf { C }$ are shown in Fig.6.The $\\mathtt { A u - Z n O }$ NS-based sensor exhibited enhanced responses compared with the pure $z _ { \\mathrm { n O } }$ NS-based sensor for all gases.Both sensors show good selectivity to ethanol. The Au-ZnO NS-based sensor showed diverse responses to different gases,as follows: methanol, 19.5；formaldehyde，4；acetone，52.5；diethyl ether，5.3; benzene,10.4； toluene，19.6； and chlorobenzene,10.9. Remarkably,the highest response value of 252 was obtained for ethanol, indicating that $\\mathtt { A u - Z n O }$ NSs has good selectivity to ethanol. Different morphologies with various exposed crystal planes were believed to influence gas sensing and photocatalytic behavior of metal oxides because of the diverse chemisorption abilities of the different exposed faces.28 The morphology of $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ could affect the selectivity of the pure ZnO-based sensor.Hamedani et al. investigated the responses of $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ with three different morphologies (NP,nanorod,and flower-like) to CO,ethanol and methane.The NP sensor had good selectivity to ethanol.29 Therefore, improved selectivity to ethanol of the $\\mathbf { A u } \\mathbf { - } \\mathbf { Z } \\mathbf { n } \\mathbf { O }$ NS-based sensor could be attributed to the spherical morphology of $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ and decorated Au NPs.

        "text": "Thus,we propose the possible gas sensing mechanism of our Au-ZnO NS-based sensor by considering the electronic sensitization and chemical catalytic effects (Fig.7).For pure $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ ,the oxygen in air could adsorb on its surface and form oxygen anions by capturing the electrons from its conduction band.This process would lead to high air resistance of $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ sensor because of the formation of depletion layer on $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ surface.30.31 However, the presence of Au NPs in Au-ZnO NSs would change the energy band structure of $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ as a result of the formation of Schottky barriers.The work function of Au metal $( 5 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { e V } )$ was larger than that of ZnO( $4 . 6 5 ~ \\mathrm { e V } )$ .Thus, the conduction band electrons of $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ would transfer into Au NPs to form depletion layers between the $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ shell and Au NPs. For $\\mathbf { A u } \\mathbf { - } \\mathbf { Z n O }$ NSs prepared in our experiments,Au NPs were not only decorated on the surface of $Z \\mathrm { n O }$ ，but also encapsulated inside.Au NPs under surface decoration could increase the width of depletion layer in $z _ { \\mathrm { n O } }$ ，which was caused by oxygen absorption. By contrast,numerous smaller Au NPs would bring numerous depletion layers around them in $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ during encapsulation. Fig.7a illustrates that these depletion layers might connect with each other and would evidently increase the air resistance of Au-ZnO NS-based sensor.This result agreed well with the experiment results in which the air resistance of Au-ZnONS-based sensor $( 2 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { M } \\Omega )$ was larger than that of pure $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ NS-based sensor $( 1 . 7 \\ \\mathrm { M } \\Omega )$ This characteristic implies that Au-ZnO NSs could display better sensitivity than pure ZnONSs,which is consistent with the aforementioned results of sensing performance.In addition to electronic sensitization,Au NPs are considered as a good catalyst to dissociate molecular oxygen because of its spillover efect.32-34 Therefore, more molecular oxygen could be absorbed on the surface of $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ after the decoration of Au NPs on the surface.The chemisorbed oxygen anions could react with ethanol molecules to release electrons back to the conduction band of $z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ when $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ is exposed to reducing gas such as ethanol (Fig.7b).This process will lead to the decrease in the resistance of $z _ { \\mathrm { n O } }$ sensor.The higher the amount of chemisorbed oxygen anions,the larger would be the decrease in resistance.Thus,compared with pure $Z _ { \\mathrm { { n O } } }$ NSbased sensor, the improved sensitivity of Au-ZnO NS-based sensor towards ethanol could be attributed to both electronic and chemical sensitization.
