In this study,we used a decision tree method based on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SAVI (soil adjusted vegetation index),and vegetation cover proportion to quantify and analyze the desertification in Eritrea using Landsat data of the 197Os,198Os and 2014. The results demonstrate that the NDVI value and the annual mean precipitation declined while the temperature increased over the past $4 0 \\textrm { a }$ .Strongly desertified land increased from $4 . 8 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ （20 $( 3 8 . 5 \\% )$ in the 1970s to $8 . 3 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ （20 $( 6 6 . 9 \\% )$ in 2014:approximately $8 5 \\%$ of the land of the country was under serious desertification，which significantly occurred in arid and semi-arid lowlands of the country (eastern, northern,and western lowlands） with relatively scarce precipitation and high temperature. The non-desertified area,mostly located in the sub-humid eastern escarpment, also declined from approximately $2 . 1 \\%$ to $0 . 5 \\%$ . The study concludes that the desertification is a cause of serious land degradation in Eritrea and may link to climate changes, such as low and unpredictable precipitation, and prolonged drought. ",

Desertification is the most serious form of environmental degradation that covers $40 \\%$ of the global land surface (Veron et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2012; Sun,2015; Zandler et al.,2015),affecting Africa in particular. Desertified land covers approximately one third of the continent of Africa including the Sahara, southern Africa (Kalahari and Namibia) and east Africa (Eritrea,Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan) (Senut et al., 2Oo9).Although scientists consider that desertification has a strong association with human activities related to agricultural expansion, overgrazing, deforestation and urbanization， climate change， such as infrequent, erratic precipitation, drought and high evapotranspiration, may also cause desertification. The impact of climate change on desertification is very complex (Xue et al., 2009; Zhou et al.,2013; Landmann and Dubovyk,2014; Xu et al.， 2014; Becerril-Pina et al.， 2015). Desertification is a more significant environmental issue in less developed countries than in rich ones (Seely et al., 2008) and has a serious impact on the poorest populations of the world (Verstraete et al., 2008).

As an indicator of climate change (Senut et al., 2009; Stringer et al., 2009; Vicente-Serrano et al.， 2012； Gao and Zhang，2016)， drought may accelerate desertification-related land degradation and adversely afect household wellbeing (Stringer et al., 2009).The reduction of precipitation in the 197Os and 1980s in Africa, mainly in the Sahelian countries,caused moderate to severe drought and increased desertification (Voortman, 1998; Nyssen et al.,2004; Xue et al., 2009; Batisani and Yarnal, 2010; Hein et al., 2011; Brandt et al., 2014).

Desertification has a direct association with the loss of production capacity in an ecosystem. Degradation of vegetation, soil properties and ecosystem production are all indicators of desertification (McGlynn and Okin, 2006; Wang et al., 2012; D'Odorico et al.,2013; Brandt et al.,2014; Ghebrezgabher et al., 2014; Xu, 2014; Zandler et al., 2015). Remote sensing data is more eficient in terms of cost, time and mapping of land degradation than fieldwork and it is productive when combined with GIS (Bakr et al.,2012). Different vegetation index models have been developed to monitor desertification and classify land use from remote sensing images.The most common vegetation indexes are NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SAVI (soil adjusted vegetation index), MSAVI (modified soil adjusted vegetation index) (Xu et al., 2009; Cui et al.,2011; Dawelbait and Morari, 2012; Li et al.,2014; Yang et al.,2014) and albedo index (Ma et al., 2011; Lamchin et al., 2016). NDVI is the index most commonly used to analyze vegetation cover (Hill et al.,2008; Cui et al., 2011; Li et al.,2013; Landmann and Dubovyk, 2014; Yang et al.,2014; Lamchin et al.,2O16) and can be used to analyze the relationship between vegetation and precipitation, particularly in the Sahelian countries (Herrmann et al., 2Oo5). Without prior knowledge of the condition of a region, changes in vegetation can be observed using the NDVI analysis method from local to global scales (Petta et al.,2O13; Dardel et al., 2014). ",

The NDVI index was used to estimate the spatial distribution of vegetation change in Eritrea from the 1970s to 2014.

In addition,a high resolution Google Earth DEM was used as a reference to enhance the accuracy of classification (Fig. 2). We selected 200,150,120,100 and 80 samples for strongly, moderately, slightly, weakly and non- desertified lands,respectively, to control and determine the threshold value for each grade of desertification in recent years. The average threshold values were investigated for each vegetation index (Table 2). For instance，the NDVI value for the non-desertified land under forest cover， which was determined from data available at http://www.fao.org/forestry/country/18314/en/eri/ (FAO， 2000)， waslower than expected (approximately ${ > } 0 . 3$ ） due to the low density of the forest.We proposed that the NDVI ${ > } 0 . 3 1 5$ is an average value for non-desertified land and the NDVI $< 0 . 1 0 1$ can be considered as strongly desertified land.We applied the same threshold value for each class in the 197Os and 1980s images to avoid biases.All types of land cover in the three periods were scaled to display comparable information. The DT rule was developed for the strongly, moderately， slightly, weakly and non-desertified lands to analyze and evaluate the progress of desertification in 1970s2014) (Fig. 3). ",

Summer precipitation seriously declined in the 1960s,1970s,1980s, 1990 and 1991,caused severe drought in Eritrea and the Sahel regions (Nyssen et al., 2004; Conway and Schipper,2011; MLWE,2012; Ghebrezgabher et al., 2014). This drought possibly caused vegetation cover to decline and increased desertification. Since the high temperature and low precipitation are indicators of high rates of evapotranspiration and land dryness, climate warming may have a great role in desertification growth in Eritrea (MAO, 2002; MLWE, 2012). Commonly, the growth of vegetation increases with rising temperature and precipitation. The vegetation cover will decrease and the rate of desertification intensifies when imbalance in the rate of evapotranspiration and amount of precipitation occurs (Xue et al., 2O09). Thus, the main climate threats in Eritrea relate to precipitation variability, including little amount, short duration and less intense rainfall, may lead to drought,and rarely cause flooding in the case of heavy rainfall (MOA, 2Oo2). Climate change may be a significant factor that induces desertification in the study area, particularly areas under extremely high temperature and extremely low precipitation (Fig. 6). However, areas under slight or weak desertification are prevalent and human factors are probably be more significant. An indirect correlation derived between the degrees of desertification and elevation of the study area is that the lower the elevation, the higher the degree of desertification. The strongly and moderately desertified lands are found below 600 m and between 6oo and $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ ；whereas,the weakly and non-desertified lands are mostly appeared above $1 5 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m }$ .In other words, $4 4 . 7 \\%$ of the area found below $6 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ ，more than $70 \\%$ （204号 below $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m }$ ,and only $4 . 2 \\%$ of the area is above $2 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m }$ (Fig. 6).

The strongly desertified land started to expand since 1970s while the moderately and weakly desertified lands shrank. The non-desertified land (perhaps the forest land) was also seriously declined in the last 4O a. The annual mean temperature significantly increased since 197Os while the annual precipitation was relatively stable.Drought is a serious problem in the study area, with moderate drought recorded throughout the study period and sometimes severe drought adversely affecting the country. Population increased as well since l96Os, which might be a cause of desertification due to increasing demand for farming, firewood and grazing. This study revealed that precipitation and temperature are important to the desertification in the study area although human factors have major impacts on desertification and land degradation as well. Therefore, immediate actions are required to preserve land to avoid further desertification, particularly in the highlands and southwestern part of the study area where the areas are dominated by slightly and weakly desertified lands.
