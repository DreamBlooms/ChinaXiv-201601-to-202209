The idea is that the quark-antiquark pairs are produced sequentially,as a result the amplitude to produce two mesons in their ground state is an oscillatory function of the total energy of the system. They argue that the oscillatory fragmentation probability could have a minimum near the mass of $\\psi ^ { \\prime }$ ，which provides an explanation for the suppressed $\\psi ^ { \\prime }$ decay. Even though their evaluations could generally accommodate the data for decays of $J / \\psi$ and $\\psi ^ { \\prime }$ to $\\rho \\pi$ and $K ^ { * } { \\overline { { K } } }$ ，it runs into difficulties when it is extrapolated to $\\Upsilon$ decays.According to their calculation，the oscillations of probability amplitude are damped out in the region of the $\\Upsilon$ resonances,so the $\\rho \\pi$ channel is present in the decay of all $\\Upsilon$ ， $\\Upsilon ^ { \\prime }$ ， $\\Upsilon ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ ， $\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot$ resonances with a common rate. This leads to a prediction $\\Gamma ( \\Upsilon  \\rho \\pi ) = 0 . 0 5 \\ \\mathrm { k e V }$ ，or equivalently $B ( \\Upsilon  \\rho \\pi ) = 9 . 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ ，which is above the current upper limit $B ( \\Upsilon  \\rho \\pi ) < 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ [27].More over,their calculation seems hard to explain the large branching fraction for $\\phi$ decays to $\\rho \\pi$ [27] due to the fact that their fragmentation probability tends to zero as the mass of the $\\rho \\pi$ decaying system approaches $1 \\mathrm { G e V } / c ^ { 2 }$ ： ",

In absence of the leading-twist perturbative QCD contribution,the dominant mechanism is supplemented by the electromagnetic decay contribution and DOZI violating contribution.FK argued that this mechanism can probe the charmonium wave function at all quark-antiquark separations and feels the difference between a $1 S$ and a $2 S$ radial wave functions. The node in the latter is supposed to lead to a strong suppression of the mechanism in $\\psi ^ { \\prime }$ decays.

It would be an intriguing problem that with more and more data and higher accurate measurements if $Q _ { s }$ and $Q _ { g }$ could approximate with each other and be consistent with $Q _ { h }$ ，or if $Q _ { s }$ and $Q _ { g }$ still deviate from each other prominently.

Although there is still no satisfactory explanation for all existing experiment results, some enlightenment ideas have been put forth. In addition，we also discuss three methods of estimating the ratio of the branching fractions in $J / \\psi$ and $\\psi ^ { \\prime }$ decays.In the light of the present theoretical and experimental status,we argue that it is important to explore the potential models from a new point of view,it is necessary to search for and/or construct an effective phenomenological model,and it is especially crucial to perform systematic measurements of various charmonium decays.
