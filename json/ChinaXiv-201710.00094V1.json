In this work,ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS） were utilised to characterise the bioactive compounds in $P .$ tenuifolia root. The UPLC-MS/MS information revealed 36 bioactive compounds， including oligosaccharide esters, polygalasaponins and polygalaxanthones. GC-MS identified 34 volatile compounds with fatty acids as the main chemicals. The leading compound judged by UPLC-MS/MS was tenuifoliside A,and oleic acid was the leading volatile from GC-MS profiles. All the samples showed similar bioactive compounds compositions,but the level of each compound varied. The results of principal component analysis revealed the principal bioactive compounds with significant level variations between samples. These principal chemicals could be used for quality judgement of $P$ . tenuifolia root, instead of measuring the levels of all compositional compounds. ",

Through reducing the number of dimensions, it can define a limited number of principal components which describe independent variation in the results [10,22]. In this work, PCA was carried out on semi-polar and volatile metabolites of $P .$ tenuifolia root to find principal variables defining the pharmacological quality. In the loading plot, it displays the influence of individual spectral peaks in each principal component and describes the separation shown in the score plot [23]. The points in the loading plot far away from zero point represent characteristic markers with most confidence to each group. Figure 3A shows the characteristic compounds for each sample. The first two principal components explained most of the total variance. The first principal components were labeled by tenuifolioses (A,E and L） and polygalasaponin XLV. The second principal component was labeled by tenuifolioses (B,F and G） and 1-hydroxy-2,3-methylene-dioxyxanthone. It was surprised that tenuifoliside A had the leading peak in the UPLC-MS profile. However, it was not the representive chemical in the two first pricinpal components due to the insignificant variance. Only those metabolites having significant variance will be calculated in the PCA model. Tenuifolioses are the characteristic oligosaccharide esters in $P$ ， tenuifolia root [24], which are constructed by pentasaccharide, phenolic acid and acetyl moieties. It is very rare to find these oligosaccharides in other plant resources. And they shows good neuroprotective and antioxidant activities, which make $P$ . tenuifolia root a good choice of traditional folk medicine. Seven xanthones were detected in the UPLC-MS profile， and only 1-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone was included in the principal component. Xanthones show good potential in the treatment against inflammation， asthma and allergy [1]. They also exhibits bioactivity against neroblastoma [25]. Polygalaxanthones are a type of xanthones characterized by C-glycoside moiety, which contribute partially to the bioactivity of $P$ . tenuifolia root. Through PCA calculation， some of oligosaccharide esters, xanthones and saponins were selected as principal components. These metabolites can be chosen to determine the quality of commercial $P$ . tenuifolia roots, instead of measuring the levels of all metabolites. This result also proved that UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS were efcient for quality evaluation of medicinal plants [26]. ",
