        "text": "AbstractThe saurichthyiform fishes were effective predators and hence the significant consumers in the aquatic ecosystems during the Early Mesozoic.They showed a notable diversification in the Anisian (Middle Triassic） Lagerstätten of southwestern China.In this contribution, we report a new species of Saurichthys from the Anisian of Yunnan,China, that displays some peculiar modifications of the axial skeleton and the longate body of the group. This new species,Saurichthys spinosa is a small-sized saurichthyid fish characterized by a very narrow interorbital region of the skull roof,an anteriorly expansive and ventrally arched cleithrum, proportionally large abdominal vertebrae lacking neural spines and alternately bearing laterallystretching paraneural plates,few fin rays in the median fins,and two paraleling rows of needlelike flank scales with strong thorns.This fish has slimmed down the body by reducing the depth of the head and the epaxial part of the trunk.The elongate paraneural plates inserted in the horizontal septum and the rigid interlocking of the flank scales render the fish a very stiff body,which is compatible with the functional consequence of the obvious decrease of the body (vertebral) segments.This discovery reveals the variability of the axial skeleton and the hydrodynamic properties of the saurichthyiform fishes. These factors,together with the innovations in the locomotion and feeding habit, might have intrinsically effected the evolutionary burst of the eastern Tethyan saurichthyiform fishes during the Anisian, a marked signature of the rapid radiation stage of the biotic recovery after the end-Permian extinction.

        "text": "Following the devastating end-Permian mass extinction, the Triassic marine ecosystem had undergone a rapid recovery and eventual re-establishment by the Middle Triassic as a stable and complex system, a process that rebuilt a high diversity of marine fishes (Chen and Benton,2012; Benton et al.,2013; Scheyer et al.,2014). The saurichthyiform fishes, characterized by a pointed head and a long body with posteriorly set median fins,are one of the most iconic fish lineages during this period (Romano et al.,2012; Benton et al., 2013; Scheyer et al.,2O14). Soon after the mass extinction, they radiated al over the globe, invading both marine and freshwater ecosystems,and became particularly speciose during the Triassic (Romano et al., 2012; Kogan et al.,2015; Maxwell et al.,2016). As specialized predators, they were an important component of these aquatic ecosystems and retained the role of high-level consumers in the marine realm until they went to extinction in the Middle Jurassic (Chen and Benton, 2012; Romano et al.,2012; Maxwell et al., 2016).

        "text": "Recent discoveries of saurichthyiform fishes from the Anisian Lagerstätten in southwestern China have vastly improved the understanding of these fishes (Wu et al., 2009, 2011,2013, 2015; Zhang et al.,2010). To date, there are up to seven morphologically and ecologically distinct species emerging in a rather short interval (late Anisian). They show a notable disparity in the body size (Hu et al.,2011; Wu et al.,2011; Benton et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014), the fin shape (Wu et al., 2011),and the feeding apparatus (Wu et al., 2013), suggesting the innovations in the locomotory pattern and the dietary preference of the saurichthyiform fishes.Except for these ‘superficial’ changes, they also exhibit some variations of the bones inside the body, namely the axial skeleton, regarding the structure of the haemal elements (Wu et al., 2O15). The saurichthyiform axial skeleton, unique in the duplication of the vertebral elements, serves as the most important structural unit that backups the body elongation in this group (Maxwell et al., 2O13) and its morphological changes therefore should have affected the functional properties of these fishes (Tintori,199o; Kogan et al., 2015). According to current knowledge, the axial skeleton varies within this group in the degree of the development of the dorsal and ventral extension of the vertebrae,the neural spines and haemal spines, or the prezygapophyses of the neural arches (summarized in Wu et al., 2015; Maxwell et al., 2016). It is notable that these variations are confined in the vertical septum of the body and there is no signal of vertebral change in other aspect even in the species that show some tendency of widening the body (Wu et al., 2011). Here we report a new species of Saurichthys from the Anisian Luoping biota of Yunnan that shows additional growth of the axial skeleton in the horizontal dimension as a compensation for the loss of the neural spines in the dorsal vertical septum, which represents a new vertebral model of this group.

        "text": "With a characteristic elongate body plan, the saurichthyiform fishes are considered as typical‘pike-like predators' and might have conducted fast-start or ambush predation (Kogan et al.,2015).For this predation pattern,the stiffness of the axial skeleton (body) and the contour of the body (e.g. fineness ratio, defined as the ratio of total body length to maximum body depth) are key functional properties that influence the effciency of the hunting (Romano et al., 2012; Kogan et al.,2O15). In generalized saurichthyiforms,the stiffess can be achieved either in the exoskeleton by the interlocking of the scutes along the dorsal and ventral midlines of the body (Rieppel,1985;Wu et al., 2009,2011,2015; Kogan et al.,2015) or occasionally in the endoskeleton (vertebral bones)by the extraordinarily long processes directed both anteriorly and posteriorly from the neural arches (Tintori,1990,2013).The fineness ratio is a good indicator for the flow disturbance, pressure distribution and drag coeffcient during the predation, which are crucial factors influencing the outcome of the hunting of the saurichthyiform fishes (Kogan et al.,2O15). This ratio is variable within this group,but it barely exceeds 18 and is mostly below 15,e.g. it is 12 in Saurichthys curioni,the model used in hydrodynamic analyses (Kogan et al.,2015). Here,the new species of Saurichthys has a very slim body with a fineness ratio of up to 20. On the basis of a detailed description of this new species,we highlight the peculiar modifications of the axial skeleton, the arrangement of the scale covering,as well as the changes of the body shape and their contributions to the stiffness and the slimness of the body. This contribution suggests the variability of these functional properties of the saurichthyiform fishes,which might be one aspect of the basis underlying the evolutionary success of these fishes during the Anisian when the marine ecosystem was fully recovered.

However, these sensory canals of the new species are distinct in the presence of prominent ridges marking their courses with large but relatively few openings (4-5 for supraorbital canal and 6-7 for postorbital canal) on the skullroof (Fig. 4A, C). In some specimens, there are paired pit lines observed on the skull roof (Fig.4A) that are comparable to the median branches of the infraorbital canals on the skull table in some Anisian Saurichthys species of Europe (Werneburg et al.,2014; Maxwell et al., 2016). The preopercular canal has several openings along the posterior edge of the preopercle. The mandibular canal opens outwards via a few short slot-like structures in the ventral flange of the angular (Figs.4B,5B),showing a condition different from other saurichthyiforms,in which a continuous series of pores extends throughout the lower jaw (Stensio,1925; Lehman, 1952; Gardiner, 1960; Rieppel, 1985; Wu et al., 2011, 2013,2015; Maxwell et al., 2015).

The neural arches are relatively large and each roughly corresponds to one flank scale. The semi-neural arch meets its antimere along the midline (Fig. 5F, G). The prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses are very weakly developed. The neural arches lack neural spines throughout the vertebral column and bear a laterally extended plate in the base of every other abdominal arch (Figs. 3B, 4B, 5F, G, H, 6C). We name these plates as ‘paraneural plates’ following Arratia's suggestions (personal communication, 2014). These plates are much longer than wide and gradually decrease in length posteriorly. The maximal length of these plates exceeds three times the width (in lateromedial dimension) of the neural arch. Among these plates, the longest one is at least three times the width of the associated neural arch.As the degree of the ossification decreases distally, the possibility cannot be ruled out that these plates might have been longer in living forms than those preserved in fossils. In medial view, a foramen is present in each platebearing neural arch. ",

Saurichthys dawaziensis is clearly distinguished from S. spinosa sp.nov. in having four rows of scales including the small, round mid-lateral scales and well-developed neural spines in the abdominal neural arches (Fig.7A). S.yangjuanensis is much larger than the new species here and it has a totally different morphology of the flank scales,extensive segmentations of the lepidotrichia of the median fins and the axial skeleton with well-developed neural spines (Wu et al., 2015). S. yunnanensis resembles the new species in having rib-like mid-lateral scales; however, it is distinct from the new taxon in having a much deeper lower jaw, a higher opercle and normally triangular ventrolateral scales in the abdominal region. In addition, S. yunnanensis has much more neural arches (at least 50 more than those in the new species) and much larger body size (Zhang et al., 2010). The Sinosaurichthys species difer from the new species here in having un-constricted interorbital region on the skull roof, a boot-like cleithrum, round mid-dorsal scales, much deeper opercles, triangular mid-lateral and roughly quadrate ventrolateral scales (Wu et al., 2O11). They also differ from S. spinosa in the presence of much more neural arches surmounted with long neural spines and the absence of the paraneural plates in the abdominal section of the axial skeleton (Wu et al.,2011).Additionally, two species of the Sinosaurichthys show the peculiar elongation of the fins,which is not seen in the new species (Wu et al.,2O1l). Yelangichthys macrocephalus shows more notable differences in the very broad interorbital part of the skull table,the different arrangement of the parietal bones,the deep lower jaw,and other notable differences in the opercular shape and cleithral structure,as well as the small and screwdriverlike teeth (Wu et al., 2013).

        "text": "The modification of the body: a slim and stiffened body and possible functional implicationsThe new species has a typical saurichthyiform body shape, with the relative head length falling in the range of the majority of the saurichthyiform fishes known by complete specimens. However, it has modified this basic profile via reducing the depth of body in both dorsal and ventral parts. The change of the abdomen can be reflected by the change of the skull depth, as the lattr roughly equals to the maximal body depth in saurichthyiform fishes. A much shallower lower jaw of the new species than in other saurichthyiforms leads to the reduction of the hypaxial depth of the trunk (Fig. 8Al, B1). From the dorsal side, the relevant feature is associated with the variation of the backbone. The vast majority of other saurichthyiform fishes usually bears well-developed neural spines in the abdominal vertebrae (Figs.7A, 8A2); in sharp contrast, the new species completely lacks this part (Figs. 7C, 8B2),a specialization shared with few coeval species from the Middle Triassic of Europe (Werneburg et al., 2014) (Fig. 7B). The loss of the dorsal extensions (neural spines) of thel axial skeleton and consequently the close proximity of the vertebral column to the dorsal ridge (mid-dorsal scales)(Fig. 6F) means that the axial column was embedded very close to the body surface and the epaxial part of the body was mostly squeezed out (Fig. 8B2). These modifications cause a very slim body with a fineness ratio ofca.20,which is much higher than that in other contemporaries in China [Saurichthys dawaziensis,17; Sa. yunnanensis,12.7; Sa. yangjuanensis,ca. 15; Sinosaurichthys longipectoralis,16, Si. longimedialis,average l6; Si. minuta, average 13; Sinosaurichthys sp., average 13 (IVPP V 23547 and V 23548)] and other saurichthyids elsewhere all over the world (Maxwell et al.,2015: fig. 9b). The body with such a high fineness ratio may be confronted with less drag and cause less flow disturbance during swimming,which are significant advantages for the predation (Kogan et al., 2015). To make use of these advantages,the fish has to maintain a steady body to minimize the undulation of the body during the crucial phrase of the attack (Kogan et al.,2O15). In particular,for the slim new Saurichthys here,one solution is to increase the stiffness of the body. ",

This is reminiscent of Lindsey's (1975） ‘Pleomersim',a phenomenon of the vertebral number being positively correlative to the maximal body length in fishes,as the new species is among the smallest members of the saurichthyiform fishes (Maxwell et al.,2016).And indeed, the scatterplot diagram shows correlation between the body length and the vertebral number within this group (Fig. 9). And interestingly, if the sampling list excludes the Sinosaurichthys species, the correlation between these two parameters is more significant (Fig. 9). However, there are exceptions, e.g. the Late Triassic species Saurichthys striolatus with 180-190 neural arches in a body of ca. $1 0 { - } 1 8 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ long,but its exceptionally large skull/body length ratio $( 4 0 \\% - 4 5 \\%$ vs.less than $30 \\%$ in the new species) implies that the measured specimens (Griffith,1959) ",

The notable decrease of the body (vertebral) segments' amount in a given body plan will consequently reduces the lateral flexibility of the fish body (Lindsey,1975).This is consistent with the functional consequence of the specializations of the axial skeleton and the flank scales. Judging from the general arrangement of the myotomes and the septa in fishes (Goodrich,193O), the wide and horizontally-set paraneural plates (Fig. 7C) must be inserted in and hence being tightly fixed by the horizontal septum (Fig. 8B2). In this way, these plates would have minimized the lateral displacement of the backbone and thereby stiffened the axial skeleton and eventually, the fish body,probably as the epineural tendons do in living fishes (Gemballa and Treiber, 2003). In addition, the articulation pattern and the paralleling arrangement of the needle-like flank scales have also contributed to the stiffness of body. The peculiar interlock of the successive flank scales (e.g., mid-lateral scale row) (Fig. 6H, I) limits the lateral undulation of the body, an effect further strengthened by its duplication in another paralleling flank scale row (ventrolateral row) (Fig. 2). Given these peculiar modifications,some of which are unique herein, the new ",
