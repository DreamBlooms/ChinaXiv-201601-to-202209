        "text": "Abstract: The farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China (FPENC) provides an important ecological barrier which restrains the invasion of desert into Northwest China. Studying drought and flood characteristics in the FPENC can provide scientific support and practical basis for the protection of the FPENC. Based on monthly precipitation data from 115 meteorological stations, we determined the changes in climate and the temporal and spatial variations of drought and flood occurrence in the FPENC during 196O-2O2O using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI),Morlet wavelet transform,and inverse distance weighted interpolation method. Annual precipitation in the FPENC showed a slightly increasing trend from 196O to 2020,with an increasing rate of about $1 . 1 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { a }$ . The interannual SPI exhibited obvious fluctuations, showing an overall non-significant upward trend (increasing rate of $0 . 0 2 / \\mathrm { a } )$ ： Therefore,the study area showed a weting trend in recent years.Drought and flood disasters mainly occurred on an interannual change cycle of 2-6 and $9 - 1 7 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ,respectively.In the future,a tendency towards drought can be expected in the FPENC. The temporal and spatial distribution of drought and flood differed in the northwestern,northern,and northeastern segments of the FPENC,and most of the drought and flood disasters occurred in local areas. Severe and extreme drought disasters were concentrated in the northwestern and northeastern segments,and severe and extreme flood disasters were mainly in the northeastern segment. Drought was most frequent in the northwestern segment, the central part of the northeastern segment,and the northern part of the northern segment. Flood was most frequent in the western part of the northwestern segment, the eastern part of the northeastern segment, and the eastern and western parts of the northern segment. The accurate evaluation of the degrees of drought and flood disasters in the FPENC will provide scientific basis for the regional climate study and critical information on which to base decisions regarding environmental protection and socio-economic development in this region.

        "text": "With the acceleration of global warming, the intensity and frequency of extreme climate events in China have changed significantly, resulting in frequent meteorological disasters such as drought and flood (Yang et al.,2008; Li et al.,2014). Studies have shown that drought and flood disasters are the meteorological disasters that occur most frequently,affect most extensive areas, and exert the greatest impact on crop production; the economic losses caused by drought and flood disasters are far more than other disasters (Gao et al.,2O16; Cao et al.,2O21). There are many drought and flood disaster evaluation indices currently in wide use,including the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)，the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)，and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (Kalisa et al.， 202O； Anandharuban and Elango，2021). Therefore, it is crucial to select the most appropriate index for disaster assessment in regional drought and flood prevention and control. ",

The SPI values over different time-scales can be applied to different types of drought and flood events,making SPI the most widely used index,applicable to all climate conditions in practice (Xu et al., 2O2O). Moreover, the SPI is easy to calculate based on precipitation data, requiring fewer data than other indices. Yu et al. (2O19) calculated the SPI at different scales based on precipitation data from 10 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province of China during 1953-2O15,and showed that precipitation is the main factor influencing drought. Zhou et al. (2019) investigated the temporal and spatial evolution of meteorological drought in the Poyang Lake Basin of China, based on the SPI. Elouissi et al. (2O21) used the SPI to analyze the extreme drought and flood disasters at 42 meteorological stations in the Macta Basin，northwestern Algeria, during 1970-2011. Li et al. (2021) discussed the temporal variation, periodic variation, and spatial differentiation characteristics of drought and flood in Northeast Guangdong Province of China using the calculated SPI values and other methods such as wavelet analysis and correlation analysis.

The agricultural system varies significantly in the FPENC (Li et al., 2018).Due to its sensitivity to climate change and variations in the impact of human activities, the FPENC has formed a fragile ecosystem. Therefore，the study of drought and flood characteristics based on climate data is essential for agricultural development and the structural adjustment of stockbreeding in the FPENC,and even for the sustainable development of the entire national economy of China. The methods for studying regional drought and flood characteristics are becoming more and more mature,and the SPI provides a widely used and highly applicable way.

It can be seen from the wavelet variance graph that there were three apparent peaks in the isoline of the real part of the Morlet wavelet coefficients based on the SPI index, corresponding to the time-scales of 13,7,and 4 a, respectively. This result indicated that these three cycles played a significant role in the temporal and spatial changes of drought and flood over the past 61 a. Among them, the maximum peak corresponded to a time-scale of $^ { 1 3 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ } }$ indicating that the 13-a cyclical oscillation was the strongest,and that there were alternating cycles between positive and negative values of the SPI, with the most decisive impact on drought and flood in the FPENC,which was the first primary cycle of the SPI value fluctuation. The 4-a time-scale corresponded to the second peak,i.e., the second main period of fluctuation in the SPI value. The 7-a time-scale reached the third peak,with the third main period of the SPI value fluctuation.The fluctuation of the above three cycles controlled the variation of drought and flood characteristics during the entire study period of the FPENC. There were about six alternate periods of drought and flood in $1 3 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ ， and the average cycle of drought and flood changes was almost $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ a ~ }$ .

        "text": "2009).At present, many indices are used to evaluate drought and flood disasters,including the SPI,Z index, PDSI,and SPEI. The SPI is based on precipitation data and assumes that the regional precipitation follows a skewed probability distribution function. The advantages of the SPI are: (1) it can be used on different time-scales, such as l month,3 months,and 12 months; (2) it reflects the severity of drought and flood in different periods and regions;and (3) its calculation is relatively simple and requires fewer data.

This study found that the interannual SPI in the study area folowed a downtrend before 2Ol2, showing a noticeable tendency towards aridity. After 2Ol2, the interannual SPI in the study area followed an upward trend and exhibited a noticeable tendency towards humidification. Disastrous drought frequently occurred in the 2O1Os. During the past 61 a, drought occurred frequently in the northwestern part of the FPENC.The degree of drought in the northern and northeastern segments was more serious,which is basically consistent with the conclusions of the published literatures (Du et al., 2015; Teng and Feng,2021).

Therefore,it is necessary to further analyze the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the SPI and verify the theoretical results according to the observed drought and flood conditions,so as to reflect the actual drought and flood characteristics in this region more accurately. This study showed that in 1960,drought occurred mainly in the eastern part of the northwestern segment and the central part of the northern segment, as well as at the junction of the northern and northeastern segments of the FPENC (Fig. 6a-e).In 1970, there were fewer drought and flood,and light drought was more frequent in the northern segment. In 1980, drought occurred in all provinces except Heilongjiang Province,and the regions with moderate and severe drought was concentrated in the northern part of the northwestern segment, the eastern part of the northern segment, and the western part of the northeastern segment. In 1990, flood was more frequent over the entire study area and concentrated in the middle part of the northwestern segment and most regions of the northern segment to the northeastern segment. In 2Ooo, the northeastern part of the northwestern segment, the eastern part of the northern segment, and the northeastern segment (except in most parts of Jilin Province) suffered moderate and severe drought.

The whole Gansu Province suffered a severe drought, and the drought in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was extensive and prolonged. Drought occurred in autumn and early winter of 197O in North China, due to very little rainfall and snowfall. In 1980, the prolonged and severe drought affected a wide area of Gansu Province. From the autumn of 1979 to the end of August 1980,there was no rainfall in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,and drought was most serious in Hebei Province.The Luanhe River, Weihe River,and Chaobai River retained low water flow, while other river channels dried up. In the farming and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there had been little rainfall for a long time and the groundwater level had generally dropped by more than $1 . 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ .In Liaoning Province,there was little rainfall after summer, and drought occurred in most regions. In 1990,rainstorm and flood afected some regions,and heavy rainfall occurred in the eastern part of the northwestern segment, most parts of the northern segment, and the southern part of the northeastern segment. Some regions did experience successive rainfall with high intensity. In spring and summer of 2Ooo, there was a serious drought in the northern segment. Precipitation in most regions north of the Yangtze River was low, causing a widespread spring drought in the northwestern segment, the northern segment, and the northeastern segment. In summer, precipitation in the northern segment, the eastern part of the northwestern segment, and the northeastern segment were even lower, and there was drought in spring and summer, quite severe in some regions.

        "text": "Based on the analysis of the temporal characteristics, periodic features,and spatial patterns of drought and flood in the FPENC from 1960 to 2020,the following conclusions can be drawn.The annual precipitation in the FPENC first decreased and then increased over the last 61 a. Overall, the interannual SPI in the FPENC showed a slight upward trend $( P { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ ,and the wetting trend in the study area was evident in recent years,consistent with the changes in annual precipitation. The Morlet wavelet transform results showed that drought and flood disasters had periodic variation characteristics of 2-6 and 9-17 a,and drought and flood disasters occurred alternately. After 2020, the FPENC will probably suffer drought. In the past 61 a,the extent of drought in the FPENC has reduced. Drought and flood disasters occurred only once in the whole region but frequently in some regions. The temporal and spatial distribution of the degree and frequency of drought and flood in the FPENC showed regional differences.Therefore,this study provides a theoretical basis for the management of the drought and flood disasters and future policy-making in the FPENC.
