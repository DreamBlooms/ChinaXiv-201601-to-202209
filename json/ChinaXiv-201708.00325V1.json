        "text": "Abstract Five taxa of Cervidae were identified from the new collection at Tuchengzi locality in Huade,Nei Mongol:Eostyloceros blainvillei,E.triangularis,Euprox sp., Cervavitus huadeensis and C.shanxius,among which the first three taxa were discovered for the first time in Huade area, and the dental specimens of the last two taxa from Tuchengzi locality are also described for the first time.E. blainvillei is a large muntiacine, diagnosed by long, thick and medially curved main beam and a relatively long brow tine emerging directly from the burr. It was originally found in Yushe Basin in Shanxi Province,and reported later from Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province. Huade is the third area yielding the species.E. triangularis distinguishes from $E$ .blainvillei by its special main beam with triangular cross sections,and it was reported only from Yushe Basin. Its presence in Huade extended its geographic distribution northward to Nei Mongol. Euprox is a transitional form of cervids from permanent antlers to seasonally deciduous ones and it is found in several localities across Eurasia.Huade is the third area in Nei Mongol yielding the taxon after Tung Gur and Siziwang Qi (Siziwang Banner). C. huadeensis is a pliocervine with four tines, and particularly with two distal tines sword-like. It is found at Tuchengzi for the second time, but not elsewhere so far,and it seems to be an endemic taxon. C.shanxius distinguishes from C. novorossiae by absence of Palaeomeryx fold on lower molars. It is widely found in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu and Nei Mongol of northern China. It is often found with numerous specimens in alocality thatindicates it lived inlarge herds.E.blainvillei,E.triangularisand C.shanxius are main members of Yushe I,i.e.Mahui Formation or Baodean. Euprox appeared also mainly in the Late Miocene. The geological age of Tuchengzi locality based on excavated cervids is therefore the Late Miocene. The numerous specimens of C. shanxius indicates forested environment in Huade area in that age. ",

The downtown of Huade is about $2 9 9 ~ \\mathrm { k m }$ northwest (headings: $3 1 8 . 6 6 ^ { \\circ }$ ）of Beijing City.The expedition by Swedish geologist and paleontologist Johan Gunna Andersson and his Chinese collaborators in 1919 marked the first paleontological investigation in Huade area,and two fossil localities,Ertemte and Harr Obo were discovered and excavated in 1919 and 1920 (Andersson,1923).A Sino-Soviet joint expedition team carried out a second paleontological investigation in Huade area in 1959 and discovered and collected many large mammal fossils from two new fosil localities,Tuchengzi and Heishatu in the county (Zhai, 1963; Qiu,1979). Tuchengzi locality is about $1 ~ \\mathrm { k m }$ north of Tuchengzi Village and about $7 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ southeast of Dawan Village, and about $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { k m }$ southeast (heading: $3 3 5 ^ { \\circ } .$ ）of Huade downtown. It belongs administratively to Tuchengzi Village although it is physically closer to Dawan than to Tuchengzi. Some follow-up excavations for “dragon bones” by local habitants were carried out in the l98Os at Tuchengzi locality, and the fossils were sold to a Chinese medicine store at Huade downtown. An incomplete mandible of a probable pliopithecine was later recovered from the store. In order to find more primate specimens and justify biostratigraphic status of Tuchengzi locality, a series of excavations have been conducted since 2013 (Dong, 2014; Dong et al.,2014,2016). The cervids are the most common materials collected during the excavations, and here we describe new materials of five taxon of Cervidae from Tuchengzi locality. The dental terminology follows that by Dong (20o4), upper teeth are abbreviated in upper case and the lower ones in lower case. The specimens described are housed at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IVPP). ",

IV, fig.2; Dong and Hu,1994),e.g. the second and third tines curve slightly medially, the ornamentation of longitudinal crests and furrows are smooth. The left proximal antler fragment with pedicle and partial frontal (V 23517.1) is close to the type by its pedicle prolonging on the frontal by a ridge,and its antler structure is also similar to that of the type although the specimen is from a young individual. Many broken antlers (V 5635) from Tuchengzi, the same locality as those described above, were regarded as nearly the same as those of $C .$ shanxius (previously regarded as Cervocerus novorossiae) from Yushe Basin (Teilhard de Chardin and Trassaert, 1937) and included into “Cervocerus novorossiae” by Qiu (1979). Compared with the antlers (V 5635) from Tuchengzi collected in 1959,the dimensions of new material are slightly smaller,but general morphology of both old and new material is similar to each other and can be considered as the same species. The antlers (V 5635) were interpreted as young stage of $C .$ huadeensis by Wang and Zhang (2O14) according to the morphological variations of antlers. With the discovery of two dimensionally different tooth types of Cervavitus at Tuchengzi locality, it is more likely that the two species of Cervavitus are present at Tuchengzi locality. The teeth and phalanges of $C$ ，shanxius from Tuchengzi are described for the first time in this paper because neither teeth nor phalanges of $C .$ . shanxius were reported previously from Tuchengzi (Qiu,1979). Both upper and lower cheek teeth are morphologically the same as those of Cervavitus shanxius from Hounao in Yushe Basin (Dong and Hu, 1994), e.g. developed neocrista on upper molars, absence of Palaeomeryx fold on lower molars. But the dimensions of teeth from Tuchengzi (Tables 1-2) are slightly larger than those from Hounao (Dong and Hu,1994: tables 4-5). Fig.7 illustrates the dimensional comparison of the upper and lower middle cheek teeth, the most numerous ones among dental materials, between the specimens from Tuchengzi and Hounao.The counterparts overlap with each other and the dimensions of the specimens from Tuchengzi are slightly larger than those from Hounao.

The biostratigraphic range of $C .$ huadeensis is recorded equivalent to MN12-MN13,but that of $C$ . (Sika) magnus equivalent to MN16-MN17, there is a large gap between them. The cladistic analysis with the available characters shows that $C .$ huadeensis falls in the cluster of Cervavitus to form a monophyly with $C .$ ，shanxius, C. ultimus,C. fenqii and $C .$ novorossiae (Dong,2011).

It was originally assigned to Cervavitus ( $\\mathbf { \\bar { \\rho } } = \\mathbf { \\rho }$ Cervocerus) novorossiae (Zdansky,1925,1927; Teilhard de Chardin and Trassaert,1937; Qiu, 1979; Dong and Hu, 1994; etc.). Its absence of Palaeomeryx fold on lower molars distinguishes it from the $C$ novorossiae from type locality, Taraklia in Moldova (Khomenko,1913), in which the fold is developed. Dong and Hu (1994) established a subspecies of $C$ ，novorossiae shanxius for such distinction. Petronio et al. (2Oo7) considered such distinction was specific and upgrade the subspecies to species and the upgrade was accepted afterwards (e.g. Dong, 2011; Dong et al., 2014) although Wang and Zhang (2014) supposed the existence of Khomenko's $C$ novorossiae in Lantian and Baode. The character of developed neocrista on molars in $C .$ shanxius is very peculiar, it is also present in Cervavitus sp. from Kohfidisch in Austria (Vislobokova, 2007), and it is probably the character of all Eurasian Cervavitus. C. shanxius is not only present in many localities in northern China, but also unearthed in relatively large quantity. It indicates that the species lived in large herds and widespread. Consequently the areas of its fossil localities should be well forested to feed such large herds of browsers. ",
