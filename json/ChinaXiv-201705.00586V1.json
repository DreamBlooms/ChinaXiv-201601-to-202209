Several colorimetric or fluorescent sensors involving this chemical mechanism have been achieved based on chromophoric moieties such as pyrene [30] or polydiacetylene [31].Besides,two ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ sensing schemes were also constructed on the basis of altering the novel photophysical effect ofAlE (Aggregation-induced emission)-active fluorogens [2.32]. Unlike traditional aggregation-caused quenching(AcQ) molecules [33,34], typical AIE-active ones such as hexaphenylsilole (HPS) and tetraphenylethylene(TPE) are non-emissive in good solutions but highly luminescent as aggregates. Tang et al.[2] thus designed a ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ assay scheme over a wide concentration range,utilizing the dipropylamine solutions of HPS.The viscosity and polarity of the solutions are significantly increased upon bubblingwith ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ ,thus inducing the strong fluorescence emission of HPS.A similar but greener approach was subsequently reported by Tian et al.[32] where 5-amino-1-pentanol solutions of TPE with lower toxicity were used.However,these fluorescent sensory systems are still not perfect because toxic reagents with unpleasant odor (mainly amine compounds)are required.Inaddition,although both of these fluorescent probes are proved to have extraordinarily high waterresistance and no problem of carbon monoxide (CO)-interfering, whether they are also highly tolerant to possibly coexisting acid $S 0 _ { 2 }$ and $\\mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \\mathsf { S }$ gases or common volatile organic compounds (alkanes, triethylamine,acetone,etc.)remains unknown.Therefore,it is of greaturgency to develop a simple,quick,highly selective and quantitative method that isapplicable ina relatively low environmental impact medium such as ethanol.

All experiments were carried out in a $3 0 \\mathrm { m L }$ Schlenk flask.Ina typical experiment,the flask was first subjected to vacuum in order to remove air and saturated with ${ \\sf N } _ { 2 }$ and ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ gas mixtures at controlled conditions (around 3oo K and 1atm).1mL anhydrous ethanol solutions of TPE-PEI $( 2 . 4 \\mathrm { m g / m L } )$ （20 were thenadded quickly into the flask and vigorously stirred there at $1 5 0 0 \\mathrm { r / \\mathrm { m i n } }$ before fluorescence measurement.Vigorous stirring of the sensory solutions was made to maximize the surface area for the reaction between ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ and the sensory solutions and shorten the equilibration time of the developed polymeric sensor,because the fabrication of a fast-response fluorescent probe is an essential prerequisite for real-time detection of ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ .As expected,the time-dependent fluorescent response profiles(Fig.S6) showed that the fluorescence intensities at $4 7 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ rapidly increased and kept nearly constant after only 2 min within experimental error.Therefore,the fluorescence intensities of the sensory solutions were recorded after being exposed to an atmosphere containing different ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 } { \\mathsf { - N } } _ { 2 }$ mixtures for $2 \\mathrm { m i n }$ .As summarized in Fig.S7,the photoluminescence response of the sensory polymer at $4 7 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ is proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide present in the $\\Nu _ { 2 } / \\thinspace \\thinspace \\thinspace \\thinspace \\subset \\thinspace 0 _ { 2 }$ gas mixtures and a LOD (limit of detection) of $1 . 2 \\ : \\mathrm { v o l } \\% \\ : \\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ is estimated according to the universal method for calculating the detection limit [43,44].

The good anti-interference ability of the presently developed sensory system towards alkanes is of great interest because there is a growing market fora cheap and reliable sensor of medium precision for the product quality monitoring of biogas,which is primarily composed of ${ \\mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ and alkanes (mainly methane)[47].
