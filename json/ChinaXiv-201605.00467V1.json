Research efforts have been undertaken to solve the above-mentioned constraints and a number of disease-resistant and high-yielding varieties were released for cultivation.

This will subsequently enable the discovery of SNPs and InDels at the genome-wide scale within both germplasm collections and breeding lines of pigeonpea.SNPs and InDels are of high importance for crop improvement programs (Chen et al.,2014; Tao et a/.,2014).Both SNPsand InDels are being used in different trait mapping approaches,haplotype analysis and GAB programs such as marker-assisted selection,marker-assisted back-crossing, genomic selection,varietal identification and hybridity testing.In recent years，SNPs have been detected and analysed in many cultivars and inbred lines of pigeonpea and used for linkage mapping and diversity analysis (Saxena et al.，2012，2014). However，these SNPs were identified in limited number of accessions and few SNPs were applicable to other accessions. Forimplementing modern GAB methodologies，it ishighly imperative to detect genome-wide variations in a larger set of accessions. ",

        "text": "Variants discovered from re-sequencing of 20 Cajanus spp. accessions offer information on sampled loci across the pigeonpea genome harboring high diversity and unique accession signatures. These polymorphic sites will be useful for developing high-density SNParrays， genotyping of several mapping populations to construct genetic maps and identify the genomic regions responsible for agronomic important traits. Unique accession signatures will be useful in varietal identification or assessment of adoption of varieties in different geographies.This study also re-emphasized that the cultivated pigeonpea genepool has a narrow genetic base and new populations such as IL,MAGlC,NAM,etc.must be used to re-introduce adaptive diversity lost through domestication and human selection in breeding.To use new genetic combinations, it is highly recommended to have high-density genotyping to track thesuperior haplotypes and avoid linkage drag inbreeding programs aimed for pigeonpea improvement.

Four accessions (ICPB 2049,ICPL 99050,ICPL 20097 and ICP 8863)were parents of twopigeonpea recombinant inbred lines:PRlL_A(ICPB $2 0 4 9 \\times 1 mathsf { C P L }$ 99050)and PRIL_C(ICPL $2 0 0 9 7 \\times 1 mathsf { C P 8 8 6 3 }$ .Eight accessions (ICP5529,HPL24,ICP7035,ICP 8863,ICP14486,ICP 11605,ICP 7426 and ICP 14209) representing breeding lines and landraces are being used in developing MAGlC population.10 aCceSsiOns(HPL 24，ICPL 85010，ICPL 85063，ICPL 87，ICPL 88039，MN 1,ICP 28,ICP 7035,ICP 7263 and ICP 8863）as founder parents and ICPL 87119 as a nested parent are being used in developing NAM population.Details on each accession have beenprovided in Table S1.

After cleaning steps,filtered reads were mapped onto the reference genome with BowTiE2 v2.2.4 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012)using default options.Reads mapped on more than one position or not mapped were filtered to define uniquely mapped reads and unmapped reads. Reads having unique alignment onto the reference genome were retained in the BAM files. BAM files Were further processed for variant (SNP and InDel) calling using Genome Analysis Toolkit suite with a minimum depth coverage of five reads per individual accession (McKenna et al.，2010). Using an in-house perl script，the distribution of identified variants was analysed along the entire genome using a contiguous window of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathsf { k b }$ ：Additionally，identified SNPs were classified into homozygous and heterozygous (reads aligned at a position contained reference as well as alternate bases) SNPs, on the basis of mismatch frequencies.InDels were identified within the size range of 1-48 bp.Accession-specific variants (SNPs and InDels)were reported only if the variant call was present in a particular accession and reference allele was present inremaining accessions.For identification of CNVs，CNVnator tool was used with an e-value of 1e-05 (Abyzov et al.，2011). Raw reads from Asha (ICPL 87119) genotype were aligned to draft assembly (Asha) for detecting the false positives in CNVs. Identified CNVs present in genes with length $\\geq 1 \\ { \\mathsf { k b } }$ were then reported.The frequencies of variants (SNPs and InDels) and CNVs were then projected using Circos (Krzywinski et al.,2oo9) across the categorized genotypes.
