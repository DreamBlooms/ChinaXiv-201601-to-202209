Over the next 20-40 years,total potentiallyavailable biomass could increase to 100-115 Mt per year,with new plantings of short-rotation trees being the major source of the increase (14.7 Mt per year by 2030 and $2 9 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { M t }$ per year by 2050). We exclude oilseeds,algae and 'regrowth',that is woody vegetation naturaly regenerating on previously cleared land,which may be important in several regionsof Australia (Australian Forestry 77,2014,1; Global Change Biology Bioenergy 7,2015,497).We briefly discusssome of the challenges to providingareliable and sustainable supply of the large amounts of biomass required to build a bioenergy industry of significant scale.More detailed regional analyses,including of the costs of delivered biomass,logistics and economics of harvest, transport and storage,competing markets for biomassand a fullasessment of the sustainabilityof production are needed to underpin investment in specific conversion facilities (e.g. Opportunities for forest bioenergy: An assessment of the environmental and economic opportunitiesand constraints asociated with bioenergy production from biomass resources in two prospective regions of Australia, 2011a).

These regional-scale spatial and temporal estimates of biomass production and potential availability are required to underpin the development of industry based on local conversion facilities, because the economies of scale depend on the distributional density of the aggregate amount of biomass feedstocks relevant to the particular conversion technology.Optimizing the scale and type of energy facility or biorefinery to the distribution,location，spatial density and seasonal supply of biomass is critical.

The beginning of the dry season is the ideal time for maximizing harvest amounts,after this the biomassdecays.In the southernwinterrainareas,harvesting takes place as soon as there is sufficient grass biomass on the ground and coincides with grain harvest in about November-December,or slightly earlier in the more northern zones.For harvest of green biomass (i.e. ",

Depending on the type of technology,there are tradeoffs between the type and scale of economy of the conversion facility,and the spatial distribution and concentration of the feedstock resource (e.g.Richard,2010; Stucley et al.,2012;Brinsmead et al.,2015a).Brinsmead et al.(2015a） suggest specific analytical approaches to define the economic tradeoffs between spatial density, cost of harvest and transport,and scale of economy for a range of emerging technologies. Richard (2010) suggests that a cellulosic biofuel refinery should have an annual output of $2 0 0 { - } 1 0 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M L }$ in order to achieve economiesof scale.IEA (2004） reports conversion efficiencies of cellulosic biomass,such as the types discussed here,to be in the range of 288-3901 of ethanol per tonne of dry feedstock.Using this range,a $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { M L }$ refinery would require $5 0 0 { - } 7 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { k t }$ of biomass per year. Richard (2010） reports that a $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { M W }$ power plant would require a similar amount of biomass. Optimizing the variables within the production plant, including cost and scale efficiency，needs to be conducted in the context of the supply chain and region,in terms of biomass spatial density，type，seasonality etc.as demonstrated by Brinsmead et al. (2015a,b). This approach can be further explored across the range of biomass types and regions matched with energy types and scales. ",
