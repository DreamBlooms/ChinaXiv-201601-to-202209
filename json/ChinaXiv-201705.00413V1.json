Herein,by using first-principles calculations,we attempt to fllthis gap by providing atomistic insights into the bonding behaviors of oxygen atom(s)at interfaces constructed by two self-mated diamond (001) or(111）surfaces.The effect of the interfacial oxygen coverage on the optimized interfacial structures is highlighted.The results show thatif the oxygen coverage is not higher than O.5,the two surfaces tend to be connected by oxygen atoms by formation of $\\scriptstyle { C - 0 - C }$ bonds,and thus high friction is expected. Otherwise,the two surfaces keep being separated,and thus low friction is expected.The interfacial electron distributions are manifested to underlie the structural optimizations.Insights gained here together with the findings of T.E.Derry et al.concerning oxygen coverage on diamond surfaces contribute to understanding the unusual frictional behavior of hydrogen-free diamond-like carbons in oxygen atmosphere.

        "text": "Friction is a science on the relative motion of two contact surfaces,for which the chemical interactions at the interface play a pivotal role[1-3].Besides the initial materials in contact with each other[3],the atmosphere usually can affect the chemical nature of the sliding interface and hence the friction outcomes.This claim is well exemplified by the fact that the friction behaviors ofvarious diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are strongly affected by the surrounding atmosphere [4-1O].The participation of environmental gaseous species in friction process is chiefly via tribochemical reaction [4-11].Hydrogen ambient is known to be important for achieving superlubricity,friction coefficient below O.O1,in DLC films,because hydrogen can chemically bond with the frictioninduced carbon dangling bonds and thus H-terminated DLC sliding interface can be maintained [9-11].The electrostatic repulsion counteracting the weak van der Waals attractions between H-terminated carbon surfaces is claimed to be responsible for the superlubricity[12,13].In humid air,the hydrogenated surfaces can be destroyed by $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ and $0 _ { 2 }$ by creating partial to full OHterminated surfaces [11,13],and thus hydrogen bonds (i.e., $\\overbrace { \\mathbf { 0 { \\mathrm { - } } H \\cdots } \\mathbf { 0 } } )$ will build across the sliding interface,leading to the friction coefficients of DLC films generally in a range of $0 . 0 2 \\mathrm { - } 0 . 2 \\$ [14]. The frictional behaviors between $\\mathsf { H } -$ or OH-terminated carbon surfaces have been intensively verified and interpreted by theoretical sim ulations as well [9,11,13,15-19]. ",

        "text": "In contrast,the frictional behavior and mechanism between carbon surfaces that are exclusively bonded with oxygen are scarcely considered.However, this is an important theme,given that oxygen-terminated carbon surfaces are dominant when H-free carbon materials are rubbed inatmospheres where only molecular oratomic oxygen is active.Gharam et al.[8] reported that the Hfree DLC film in a dry mixture of $0 _ { 2 }$ and Ar yielded high friction coefficients with significant fluctuation $\\left( 0 . 3 5 \\pm 0 . 0 5 \\right)$ ，whileina humid mixture with $45 \\%$ RH, the film could show low and steady friction coefficients $( 0 . 1 2 \\pm 0 . 0 1 ) \\$ ). Similarly, Qi etal.[9] showed that the H-free DLC film produced a high friction coefficient of O.72 in dry $\\mathsf { N } _ { 2 }$ ，an intermediate friction coefficient of O.28 in dry air $( 0 _ { 2 } { : } \\mathsf { N } _ { 2 } = 2 2 \\% { : } 7 8 \\%$ and ${ \\sf N } _ { 2 }$ is inert),and a ultralow friction coefficient of 0.012 in $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ gas.However,the relatively high friction of the H-free DLC film in dry air has not been explained in the theoretical study because the interaction of $0 _ { 2 }$ with H-free DLC surface is complex [9]. Recently, Zilibotti et al.[19] paid some attention to one type of O-passivated diamond interface constructed with two oxygenated diamond (Oo1) surfaces with oxygen in ether (C-O-C) configuration.Unfortunately, insights gained from their firstprinciples study cannot decipher the experimental results reported in refs 8 and 9.They showed that the equilibrium distance between O-terminated diamond surfaces was larger than that between H-terminated diamond surfaces,and the lateral potential energy surface of the oxygenated interface was also smoother than that of hydrogenated one [19]. Therefore,one can expect the oxygenated diamond interface to show a superlow friction coefficient even lower than that of the well-known superlubricating Hpassivated interface.However,Feng et al.[2O] gave evidence that the atomic O was less effective than atomic H in reducing the friction of a diamond on diamond contact.Then a question is:what isthe friction mechanism of H-free diamond-like carbons in molecule or atomic oxygen?

The surfaces were modeled by $( 2 \\times 1 )$ supercells,as illustrated in Fig.1.The interfaces were constructed with two same diamond surface slabs with mirror-symmetry.Thus, the interface models had totally 48 carbon atoms,of which 4 atoms had dangling bonds at the interfaces.Various numbers of oxygen atoms from1 to 4 were added in the interface regions to take into account the effect of coverage.In fact,oxygen molecules would dissociate into atoms and bond to carbon atoms during the relaxation. Considering the limited adsorption configurations of oxygen on diamond surfaces,we could firstly distribute the oxygen atom(s） to the two surfaces and move it(them）close to the adsorption site(s),and then optimize the interfacial models.Two types of interfaces could be obtained,depending on the distance between the two surfaces and the number of oxygen atoms.If the two surfaces were apparently separated from each other in the optimized interface (type I),we would narrow the separation between the two surfaces to determine whether or not the interface could be sutured by oxygen atoms (type II).Interactions between periodic replicas of interface models were minimized by including a vacuum region of $1 5 { \\mathring { \\mathsf { A } } } .$ During geometry optimization,all atoms were allowed to fully relax while the cell parameters were fixed. Moreover,differential electron density and Mulliken atomic population were calculated to detect the mechanisms behind the phenomena observed in structural optimizations. ",

The latter does not present in the H-passivated carbon interface, since hydrogen atom has no lone-pair on it. Owing to such electrostatic repulsions,the two O-terminated diamond surfaces keep to be well-separated. ",

This concern can be dispelled by the findings of Derry and coworkers [21-23] concerning the oxygen coverage on diamond surfaces.They measured the oxygen coverage on natural diamond surfaces by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry,and the results unexpectedly showed that the coverage of chemisorbed oxygen on diamond（Oo1）and（111）surfaces is only about $1 / 2$ and $1 / 3$ monolayer,respectively[21,22].The underlying reason is the fact that the van der Waals diameter of oxygen atom $( 2 . 8 0 \\mathring { \\mathsf { A } } )$ is larger than the nearest distance between two active carbon atoms on the diamond surfaces $( 2 . 5 4 \\mathring { \\mathsf { A } } )$ ,which can result in the steric hindrance that prevents the accommodation of oxygen at the adjacent sites and limits the oxygen coverage to partial monolayer,as illustrated in Fig.13.The notion was further consolidated by their subsequent DFT study [23],where they demonstrated that increasing oxygen coverage higher than $1 / 3$ monolayer on the diamond（111） surface will develop repulsive interactions between oxygen atoms.

The carbon to carbon frictional interfaces are modeled by selfmated diamond（Oo1）and（111）surfaces，and 1 to 4 oxygen atoms are placed in the interface regions,and then structural optimizations are conducted.The results show that if the interfacial oxygen coverage is nothigher than O.5,the mating surfaces tend to be connected by oxygen atoms by formation of $\\mathsf { C } { \\mathrm { - } } 0 { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathsf { C }$ bonds,and thus high-friction is expected.Otherwise,the two surfaces keep being separated,and thus low-friction is expected.The interfacial electron distributions are manifested to underlie the structural optimizations.According to the insights gained here together with the findings of T.E.Derry et al. concerning oxygen coverage on diamond surfaces,we suggest that it is the coexistence of highfriction atomic domains and low-friction domains at the friction interface that leads to the intermediate friction coefficients of hydrogen-free diamond-like carbons in oxygen atmosphere.
