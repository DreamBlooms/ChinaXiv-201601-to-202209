This work is a folow-up to Wang et al.，using significantly upgraded new simulations.We focus on the contribution of the velocity vortices and the fast shock reflection and refraction in the solar corona to the formation of the EUV waves.Folowing the loss of equilibrium in the coronal magnetic structure,the fux rope exhibits rapid motions and invokes the fast-mode shock forward of the rope,which then produces the type II radio burst. The expansion of the fast shock,which is associated with outward motion,takes place in various directions,and the downward expansion shows the reflection and the refraction as a result of the non-uniform background plasma. The reflected component of the fast shock propagates upward and the refracted component propagates downward.As the refracted component reaches the boundary surface,a weak echo is excited. The Moreton wave is invoked as the fast shock touches the bottom boundary,so the Moreton wave lags the type I burst.A secondary echo occurs in the area where reflection of the fast shock encounters the slow-mode shock,and the nearby magnetic field lines are further distorted because of the interaction between the secondary echo and the velocity vortices. Our results indicate that the EUV wave may arise from various processes that are revealed in the new simulations. ",

(2012)and references therein). One interesting phenomenon closely associated with CMEs is the globally propagating wave-like disturbance in the corona,i.e. the EIT or EUV wave. Moses et al.(1997) first reported this phenomenon,and Thompson et al.(1998） first analyzed this phenomenon in detail using the data from the Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)Imaging Telescope(EIT）on (space）board the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft.

The EUV waves are usually associated with CMEs, dimmings, type II radio bursts,and flares (Biesecker et al. 2Oo2). Recently，Nitta et al. (2O13) presented a large sample of events that look like EUV waves as observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;Lemen et al. (2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory( $S D O$ )，and revisited their associations with flares,CMEs and type II radio bursts.They found that the speed of EUV waves is not strongly correlated with CME magnitude or the flare intensity, nor do they show an association with type II bursts (cf.

At t=50 s,the plasma flow near the side back of the flux rope results in vortices,as clearly seen in the lower-left panel of Fig.6. The flow is so strong that it impacts the nearby magnetic field lines,resulting in distinct deformation of the nearby magnetic structures.Because the background plasma in the corona is not uniform,reflection and refraction take place at both wake ends of the fast shock as it moves downward (see Fig.8).The reflected component of the fast shock propagates upward and the refracted compo nent propagates downward continuously. In this paper, weuse the term“reflection”for the reflection that takes place in the propagation path of the fast-mode shock due to the non-uniform media.The“echo”for the reflection occurs on the boundary surface.However,in physics, reflection and echo are actually the same phenomenon.

So our simulations show that the origin of EUV waves includes not only the fast shock propagating freely in a certainlayer,but also various disturbances caused by the fast shock and the motion of the flux rope.

The downward expansion produces reflection and refraction as a result of the non-uniform background plasma density. The reflected component of the fast shock propagates upward and the refracted component propagates downward. 4.As the refracted component touches the boundary surface,a weak echo is produced.The Moreton wave is invoked as the fast shock sweeps the bottom boundary, so the Moreton wave lags the type I burst. 5.

The nearby magnetic field lines are further distorted because of the interaction between the secondary echo and the vortices. 7.During the subsequent evolution,we found an interesting phenomenon: a large structure consisting of two small vortices.One vortex is influenced by the initial reflected component of the fast shock,and another one is impacted by the strong echo of the fast shock. The latter vortex is stronger and faster,and so it overtakes the former in a short time scale,which may correspond to the ripples as observed in a specific event (e.g. see Liu et al. (2010)). ",
