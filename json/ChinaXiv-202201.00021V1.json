        "text": "Abstract: The Tarim River is the longest inland river in China and is considered as an important river to protect the oasis economy and environment of the Tarim Basin. However, excessive exploitation and over-utilization of natural resources, particularly water resources, have triggered a series of ecological and environmental problems,such as the reduction in the volume of water in the main river,deterioration of water quality,drying up of downstream rivers,degradation of vegetation,and land desertification.In this study, the land use/land cover change (LUCC) responses to ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches of the Tarim River were investigated using ENVI (Environment for Visualizing Images) and GIS (Geographic Information System) data analysis software for the period of 1990-2018. Multi-temporal remote sensing images and ecological water conveyance data from 1990 to 2018 were used. The results indicate that LUCC covered an area of $2 6 4 4 . 3 4 ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ during this period, accounting for $1 5 . 7 9 \\%$ of the total study area.From 1990 to 2018,wetland,farmland,forestland,and artificial surfaces increased by 533.42 $\\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ $( 2 1 6 . 7 7 \\% )$ ， $4 4 6 . 6 8 ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ $( 1 2 3 . 6 6 \\% )$ ， $2 8 4 . 5 5 ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ $( 5 . 6 7 \\% )$ ，and $5 7 . 5 1 ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ $( 2 1 7 . 9 6 \\% )$ ，respectively, whereas areas covered by grassand and other land use/land cover types,such as Gobi, bare soil,and deserts， decreased by $1 0 3 . 3 4 ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ $( 1 4 . 3 1 \\% )$ and $1 2 1 8 . 8 3 \\ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ $( 1 1 . 7 5 \\% )$ ，respectively. Vegetation area decreased first and then increased,with the order of $2 0 1 0 { < } 2 0 0 0 { < } 1 9 9 0 { < } 2 0 1 8$ .LUCC in the overflow and stagnant areas in the lower reaches of the Tarim River was mainly characterized by fragmentation, irregularity，and complexity. By analyzing the LUCC responses to 19 rounds of ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches of the Tarim River from 200O to the end of 2018,we proposed guidelines for the rational development and utilization of water and soil resources and formulation of strategies for the sustainable development of the lower reaches of the Tarim River. This study provides scientific guidance for optimal scheduling of water resources in the region. ",

Changes in the fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) in the lower reaches of the Tarim River have been monitored from 2000 to 2017,using the time sequence normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data produced by MOD13Q1; further, the growth and recovery of vegetation in the region under ecological water conveyance have also been explored (Zhu et al., 2019).By combining Landsat TM/ETM and China & Brazil Earth Resource Satelite/Chargecoupled Device (CBERS/CCD） remote sensing images,Liu et al.

This indicates that vegetation has undergone a process of degradation and then restoration. Many studies have suggested that the benefits of water conveyance wil take several years to be visible and cannot be observed immediately (Wan,2012; Guo et al.,2017; Wang and Guo,2018). Similar to the gradual degradation of vegetation before water conveyance， the ecological responses of downstream vegetation and groundwater are also slow on the spatio-temporal scale (Chen et al.,2015a,b; Keyimu et al.,2017). For example, we analyzed the relationship between vegetation area in 2010 and 2018 and ecological water conveyance in previous years (2009 and 2017,respectively). In December 2O09, the cumulative number of water conveyance days was 26 d, and the cumulative water conveyance capacity was $0 . 1 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ ，reaching the position of Kaerdayi. Water conveyance in 2O17 was divided into three months: April, May, and December; there were 215 cumulative water conveyance days,and the cumulative amount of water delivery was $8 . 3 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ . This affected the growth of vegetation in 2018.In addition, early ecological water conveyance was launched in February 2018 to solve the problem of ecological water supply in spring. The change in vegetation area in each year was positively correlated with the cumulative ecological water conveyance in the previous year, with one, two, three,four, and five years of cumulative ecological water conveyance volume in response to LUCC. Therefore, the short-term and long-term effects of cumulative ecological water conveyance effectively promote the natural restoration of vegetation on both sides of the river (Ye et al.,2O09; Zhang et al., 2013).

Our study indicated that the main source of groundwater recharge in the lower reaches of the Tarim River is river runoff in both vertical and horizontal directions,and the amplitude of groundwater level fluctuations gradually slows down with increasing distance both vertically and horizontally (Wu and Cai, 2004; Yu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017). Based on the interpretation of remote sensing images and field monitoring,it can be concluded that shallow groundwater level in the lower reaches of the Tarim River increased as a result of ecological water conveyance. According to the monitoring data, the depth of groundwater increased from 9.8-10.1 to $2 . 1 { - } 5 . 3 \\mathrm { m }$ at a distance of 1 km from the main river channel, and groundwater mineralization increased from 1.1-3.0 to $5 . 3 \\mathrm { - } 7 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { g / L }$ during the period from 2000 to 2017 (Ablekim et al.， 2016; Chen et al.,2019). Previous studies showed that vegetation in the lower reaches ofthe Tarim River has ben restored, and the area increased to $2 2 8 5 . 0 \\mathrm { \\bar { 0 } } \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ,with an increase of $3 6 2 . 0 0 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ . The sandy area decreased by $8 5 4 . 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ and the number of plant species increased from 17 to 46,with hogweed, white thorn, camel thorn, reed,sand jujube,and licorice as the main types (Fan et al.,20l3,2014; Ye et al.,2014a,b; Chen et al.,2015a,b,2020). Some drought-tolerant trees and shrubs also gradually recovered, and the floral biodiversity gradually restored. After years of continuous ecological water conveyance, the flooded poplar forestland area in the lower reaches of the Tarim River reached a total area of $7 1 2 . 0 0 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ . Extensive poplar forests that had died due to lack of water have been restored. Additionally,area of artificial surfaces exhibited an increasing trend, while area covered by other land use/land cover types,such as Gobi, bare soil,and deserts,decreased significantly, indicating that the study area was increasingly affected by human activities, mainly since 2000 (Hartmann et al., 2016; Bao et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018). However, according to the response of LUCC to ecological water conveyance analyzed in this study, the increased area and the recovery of vegetation were still mainly concentrated in certain areas.Therefore, further efforts should be made to ensure long-term， stable,and more scientific ecological water conveyance and rational utilization of water resources in the lower reaches of the Tarim River.
