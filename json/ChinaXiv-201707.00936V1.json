The functional can be one of the following four forms: the meson exchange or point-coupling nucleon interactions combined with the non-linear or density-dependent couplings.For the pp channel,either the BCS approach or the Bogoliubov transformation is implemented. The MDC-CDFTs with the BCS approach for the pairing (in the following labelled as MDC-RMF models with RMF standing for“relativistic mean field\"） have been applied to investigate multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces and the non-axial octupole $Y _ { 3 2 }$ -correlations in $N = 1 5 0$ isotones.In this contribution we present briefly the formalism of MDC-RMF models and some results from these models.The potential energy surfaces with and without triaxial deformations are compared and it is found that the triaxiality plays an important role upon the second fision barriers of actinide nuclei. In the study of $Y _ { 3 2 }$ -correlations in $N = 1 5 0$ isotones,it is found that,for $^ { 2 4 8 } \\mathrm { C f }$ and $^ { 2 5 0 }$ Fm, $\\beta _ { 3 2 } > 0 . 0 3$ and the energy is lowered by the $\\beta _ { 3 2 }$ distortion by more than $3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { k e V }$ ； while for $^ { 2 4 6 } \\mathrm { C m }$ and $^ { 2 5 2 }$ No, the pocket with respect to $\\beta _ { 3 2 }$ is quite shallow.

Besides these features, it was found for the frst time that the outer barrier is also considerably lowered by about 1 MeV when the triaxial deformation is allowed. In addition,a better reproduction of the empirical barrier height can be seen for the outer barrier.

However, to estimate the fission barrier heights with an even higher accuracy, it is desirable to include also the effects of the non-axial deformations. From these potential energy curves it is clear that the non-axial deformations lower the outer barriers by around O.5 to 1 MeV compared with the axial symmetric results.

        "text": "In Ref. [6] the non-axial reflection-asymmetric $\\beta _ { 3 2 }$ shape in some transfermium nuclei with （20 $N = 1 5 0$ ，namely $^ { 2 4 6 }$ Cm, $^ { 2 4 8 }$ Cf, $2 5 0$ Fm,and $2 5 2$ No were investigated using the MDC-RMF model. In Fig. 5, we show potential energy curves for these $N = 1 5 0$ isotones. For $^ { 2 4 6 }$ Cm, the ground state deformation $\\beta _ { 3 2 } = 0 . 0 2 0$ . The potential energy curve is rather flat around the minimum. We denote the energy difference between the ground state and the point with （204 $\\beta _ { 3 2 } = 0$ by $E _ { \\mathrm { d e p t h } }$ which measures the energy gain with respect to the $\\beta _ { 3 2 }$ distortion. For $^ { 2 4 6 }$ Cm, $E _ { \\mathrm { d e p t h } }$ is only 34 keV. For $^ { 2 4 8 }$ Cf, $2 5 0$ Fm, and $2 5 2$ No, the minima locate at $\\beta _ { 3 2 } = 0 . 0 3 7$ ,0.034, and 0.025, respectively. The corresponding energy gain $E _ { \\mathrm { d e p t h } } = 0 . 3 5 1$ , 0.328,and 0.104 MeV. As is discussed in Ref. [6], the occurrence of the non-axial octupole $\\beta _ { 3 2 }$ correlations is mainly from a pair of neutron orbitals [734]9/2 $( \\nu j _ { 1 5 / 2 } )$ and [622]5/2 $( \\nu g _ { 9 / 2 } )$ which are close to the neutron Fermi surface and a pair of proton orbitals [521]3/2 $( \\pi f _ { 7 / 2 } )$ and [633]7/2 $( \\pi i _ { 1 3 / 2 } )$ which are close to the proton Fermi surface.

        "text": "It may be hard to conclude that these nuclei have static non-axial octupole deformations from these results because the potential energy curve is flat around the minimum and $E _ { \\mathrm { d e p t h } }$ is small [6]. However, the present calculations at least indicate a strong $Y _ { 3 2 }$ -correlation in these nuclei. Both the non-axial octupole parameter $\\beta _ { 3 2 }$ and the energy gain $E _ { \\mathrm { d e p t h } }$ reach maximal values at $^ { 2 4 8 }$ Cf in the four nuclei along the $N = 1 5 0$ isotonic chain. This is consistent with the analysis given in Refs. [34,35] and the experimental observation that in $^ { 2 4 8 }$ Cf, the $2 ^ { - }$ state is the lowest among these nuclei [36]. ",

        "text": "In this contribution we present the formalism and some applications of the multi-dimensional constrained relativistic mean field (MDC-RMF） models in which all shape degrees of freedom （20 $\\beta _ { \\lambda \\mu }$ deformations with even $\\mu$ are allowed. The potential energy surfaces (curves) of $2 4 0$ Pu and actinide nuclei with various symmetries are investigated. It is found that besides the octupole deformation, the triaxiality also plays an important role upon the second fission barriers. For most of even-even actinide nuclei, the triaxiality lowers the outer barrier by $0 . 5 \\sim 1$ MeV, accounting for about $1 0 \\sim 2 0 \\%$ of the barrier height. The non-axial reflection-asymmetric $\\beta _ { 3 2 }$ （204 shape in some transfermium nuclei with $N = 1 5 0$ , namely $^ { 2 4 6 }$ Cm, $\\mathrm { ^ { 2 4 8 } C f }$ ， ${ } ^ { 2 5 0 } \\mathrm { F m }$ ，and $2 5 2$ No are studied and rather strong non-axial octupole $Y _ { 3 2 }$ effects have been found in $^ { 2 4 8 }$ Cf and $^ { 2 5 0 } \\mathrm { F m }$ which are both well deformed with large axial-quadrupole deformations, $\\beta _ { 2 0 } \\approx 0 . 3$ .We note that it is crucial to include the reflection asymmetric and non-axial shapes simultaneously for the study of potential energy surfaces and fisson barriers of actinide nuclei and of nuclei in unknown mass regions such as superheavy nuclei.
