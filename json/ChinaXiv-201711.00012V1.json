        "text": "Abstract: An improved algebraic reconstruction technique(ART) with tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy(TDLAS） is presented in this paper for determining two-dimensional distribution of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ concentration and temperature in a simulated combustion flame.This work aims to simulate the reconstruction of spectroscopic measurements by a multi-view parallel-beam scanning geometry and analyze the effects of projection rays on reconstruction accuracy. It finally proved that reconstruction quality dramatically increases with increasing number of projection rays until they are more than 18O for $2 0 \\times 2 0$ grid,after that point, the number of projection rays has litle impact on reconstruction accuracy. It is clear that the temperature reconstruction resultsare more accurate than the water vapor concentration bytraditional concentration calculation method, the study in this article also proposed an innovative way to remove the error of concentration reconstruction and improve the reconstruction quality greatly, the capability of this new method is evaluated by appropriate assessment parameters.By using this new approach, the concentration reconstruction accuracy is not only badly improved, but also a suitable parallel-beam arrangement is put forward for sake of high reconstruction accuracy and simplicity of experimental validation. At last, a bimodal structure of combustion region is assumed to demonstrate the robustness and universality of the proposed method. Numerical investigation indicates that the proposed TDLAS tomographic algorithm is capable for accurate temperature and concentration profiles detection, this feasible formula for reconstruction research is expected to resolve several key issues in practical combustion devices.

        "text": "Over the past decades, TDLAS has become an indispensable method for making sensitive and fast in situ measurements in gaseous detection， such as species concentration， pressure, temperature, and velocity[1,2,3]. Traditional absorption spectroscopy is a line-of-sight(LOS） technique，which can only reflects averaged value along the laser path without providing any spatially resolved information[4,5,6], while the temperature and concentration among combustion area are usually non-uniform, thus, it is necessary to accurately obtain the spatial distribution of fluid field parameters. Recently, TDLAS data is combined with computer tomography(CT), herein referred to as tunable diode laser absorption tomography(TDLAT),to image two-dimensional distribution of combustion properties of scramjet wind tunnel. TDLAT can be roughly divided into two categories in terms of reconstruction algorithm: transformation method, the representative algorithm is filtered back projection(FBP) algorithm[7,8,23], which needs complete projection data to realize physical reconstruction,and the other one is iterative method, the main example is algebraic reconstruction technique(ART) algorithm[9,10,11,12]. Bryneretal. employed filtered back projection algorithm to reconstruct the peak of the water vapor absorption transition centered at approximately $7 1 6 4 . 9 \\mathrm { { c m } ^ { - 1 } }$ of flat burner and indoor environment based on experimental measurements[13].Li Fei Et al. designed a set of TDLAT system with 6 parallel rays which were arranged in different position, they reconstructed the temperature and concentration distribution of scramjet combustor exit using ART[14].L.Ma used a tunable laser called “fiber Fabry-Perot tunable filter laser(FFP-TFL)” to scan over the 1333-1377nm range at ${ \\sim } 2 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ in the 2D reconstruction of temperature and $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ concentration distributions over a Hencken burner flame[15]. Although the FBP algorithm can obtain highly accurate reconstructions of objective area, especially in medical imaging, a large number of closely sampled angular views and projection rays may increase the difficulty of experimental design， therefore，FBP reconstruction study based on laboratory verification is rarely reported in the literature.Unlike FBP,ART tomography algorithm has been successively used for combustion diagnosis because of its strong resistance to noise and availability with only limited projection data[12,16]. Even though many researchers have performed relevant work for imaging, it is hard to evaluate the preciseness of reconstruction results， especially the concentration distribution results, it is usually not so satisfactory when compared with temperature reconstruction by using traditional method[23].

At the same time， asymmetric temperature and concentration distribution models were created to analyze the robustness and universality of the proposed algorithm. By the way of this article, the temperature and concentration can be simultaneously and precisely generated whatever the combustion flow field is like in the future. ",

We numerically demonstrated a spatial resolution with totally containing up $2 0 \\times 2 0$ grid points for an improved ART algorithm. By quantitatively calculating the reconstruction error of different parallel-beam scanning arrangements, it proved that reconstruction accuracy was greatly dependent on projection rays only when they were less than a certain value, additionally, the concentration reconstruction results are always worse than the temperature reconstruction by traditional algorithm. Therefore,a modified concentration calculation method was introduced later, which aimed to directly reconstruct concentration instead of deriving from temperature. This proposed method facilitates the high-quality concentration reconstruction without adding extra projection rays. The conclusions presented in the above indicate that projection rays should be approximately equal to half of the grid number or near this magnitude if we simultaneously consider the reconstruction accuracy and simplicity in engineering application. At the end of this article, we applied this proposed method to a more complicated flow field model for demonstrating the robustness and universality of the method. The study in this work validates an available and feasible approach for precisely reconstructing temperature and concentration distribution,and we believe that it certainly can offer a good theoretical foundation for experimental verification in the future.
