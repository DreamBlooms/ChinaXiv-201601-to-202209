However,Achlioptas,D'Souza,and Spencer [4] found recently that the percolation phase transition in random network becomes discontinuous (first-order) under the Achlioptas process (AP),where the edge with minimum product of cluster masses is connected from the two randomly chosen unoccupied edges.The Achlioptas process suppresses the appearance oflarger cluster and discourages the formation of a giant component,which has the size comparable with the number of vertices $N$ . The percolation phase transition is delayed by this Achlioptas process and becomes sharper.It was argued by them[4] that the phase transition is discontinuous and named as an explosive percolation.Later,the Achlioptas process was introduced to the two-dimensional regular lattice networks [5] and scale-free networks [6,7].It was claimed that the explosive percolation was found both in lattice [5] and in scale-free networks[6,7].

It is not well established that the first-order phase transition can be distinguished from the continuous phase transition by the size-dependence of $\\varDelta$ . It was argued by da Costa et al.[9] that the explosive percolation transition, under their modified Achlioptas process, is actually continuous.Recently,Riordan et al.[1O] show mathematically that all Achlioptas process have continuous phase transitions.The finite-size behavior of the order-parameter distribution function has been used as the evidence of both discontinuous[11] and continuous[l2] phase transition.It is also argued with the finite-size scaling that the explosive percolation is continuous [13,14].This controversy about the character of explosive percolation is going on and calls for further investigations.
