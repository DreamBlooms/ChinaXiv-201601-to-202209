        "text": "Abstract: The vegetation ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China,considered to be the \"natural laboratory\"of climate change in the world,has undergone profound changes under the stress of global change.Herein，we analyzed and discussed the spatial-temporal change patterns and the driving mechanisms of net primary productivity (NPP) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2000 to 2015 based on the gravity center and correlation coeficient models. Subsequently, we quantitatively distinguished the relative effects of climate change (such as precipitation, temperature and evapotranspiration) and human activities (such as grazing and ecological construction) on the NPP changes using scenario analysis and Miami model based on the MOD17A3 and meteorological data. The average annual NPP in the QinghaiTibet Plateau showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest during 200o-2015.With respect to the inter-annual changes, the average annual NPP exhibited a fluctuating upward trend from 2000 to 2015, with a steep increase observed in 2005 and a high fluctuation observed from 2005 to 2015. In the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the regions with the increase in NPP (change rate higher than $10 \\%$ ）were mainly concentrated in the Three-River Source Region,the northern Hengduan Mountains,the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River,and the eastern parts of the North Tibet Plateau, whereas the regions with the decrease in NPP (change rate lower than $- 1 0 \\%$ ）were mainly concentrated in the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Ali Plateau. The gravity center of NPP in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has moved southwestward during 20-2015,indicating that the increment and growth rate of NPP in the southwestern part is greater than those of NPP in the northeastern part. Further,a significant correlation was observed between NPP and climate factors in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The regions exhibiting a significant correlation between NPP and precipitation were mainly located in the central and eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,and the regions exhibiting a significant correlation between NPP and temperature were mainly located in the southern and eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.Furthermore,the relative effects of climate change and human activities on the NPP changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau exhibited significant spatial differences in three types of zones,i.e.,the climate change-dominant zone, the human activity-dominant zone,and the climate change and human activity interaction zone.These research results can provide theoretical and methodological supports to reveal the driving mechanisms of the regional ecosystems to the global change in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

NPP is the residual part of the total amount of organic matter produced by photosynthesis after the elimination of autotrophic respiration. As the core content of the carbon budget and climate change research, NPP serves as an important indicator to determine the ecosystem health and sustainable development level (Alexander et al., 2Oo07; Zhang et al., 2014; Leandro et al., 2O19). Therefore, analyzing and discussing the spatial-temporal change pattrns and the driving mechanisms of NPP in a regional vegetation ecosystem not only are of significance to understand the response of this ecosystem to climate change, but also can provide a scientific basis for ecological environment protection， plant yield estimation, resource exploitation, effective management of natural resources,and formulation of the corresponding social and economic development strategies (Sun et al., 2014).

Furthermore,the driving mechanisms on the response of NPP to climate change differ because of the differences in data sources， research areas and spatial-temporal scales (Chandrasekaran and Swamy, 2002； Travis et al.， 2015). NPP globally increased from 1980 to 20o0; however, the reasons varied in different regions (Li et al.,2018; Ji et al.,2019). Under the background of global change, climate in China has undergone significant changes,and the NPP of terrestrial vegetation exhibited an increasing trend (Chirici et al., 2007; Gao et al.,2018; Wang and Li, 2018;Wang et al., 2018). Climate change weakens the stress of hydrothermal conditions on vegetation growth. However, the response of vegetation NPP in China to climate change shows obvious regional differences (Guo et al., 2O17; Li et al., 2017; Wang et al.,2017; Wang et al., 2018; Fatemeh et al., 2019). Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the driving mechanisms of NPP under the stress of global change in different regions (Edward et al., 2013). ",

As a special geographic unit, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau exhibits an important role in regulating and indicating global change; it is considered to be the \"natural laboratory\" for studies of climate change in the world (Haberl et al.,2004; Huang et al.,2008; Sun et al., 2014; Wang et al.,2016). Although some previous studies have used conventional analysis methods (such as the correlation analysis model) to investigate the NPP change paterns in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the relationships between NPP and climate factors and the relative effects of climate change and human activities on the NPP changes remain unclear (Sun et al., 2O14; Huang et al., 2018; Jeremy et al., 2018; Sunil et al.,2O19).Further, the \"gravity center\" concept, which indicates the point at which the force of gravity present on each part of an object exerts a resultant force, is derived from physics (Liu et al., 2011). However, in geography, the \"gravity center\" concept has been extensively applied to population, economy, food,land use,ecological environment, regional development and other fields (Liu et al., 2O11). The spatial variation of the gravity center can beter reflect the variation degree and trend of geographical phenomena. ",

In winter, strong winds (lasting for up to $2 0 0 \\mathrm { d }$ in some places) and scarce precipitation can be observed because of the influence of the dry westerlies in the plateau. Further, complex and diverse vegetation landscape types, including forests, meadows, grassands and deserts,appear successively in the horizontal belt spectrum of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the climate gradually changes from the marine wet type in the southeast to the continental arid type in the hinterland of the plateau (Yang et al., 2015).

The number of the NPP gravity centers in different quadrants of the coordinate system and its percentage were estimated.The results shown in Figure 6 denoted that $3 7 . 5 0 \\%$ of the NPP gravity centers were located in the southwest quadrant, which were followed by those in the northeast quadrant with a proportion of $2 5 . 0 0 \\%$ This indicated that the increment and growth rate of NPP in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were relatively large during the study period. In addition, the sum of the gravity center number in the two aforementioned quadrants accounted for $6 2 . 5 0 \\%$ of the total gravity center number. Further, the proportions of the NPP gravity centers in the northwest and southeast quadrants were relatively small at $1 8 . 7 5 \\%$ . Thus,we divided the study area into two parts based on the coordinate axis. The gravity center number of NPP in the northern half quadrant $( 4 3 . 7 5 \\% )$ was slightly smaller than that in the southern half quadrant $( 5 6 . 2 5 \\% )$ .

In 2006,2007 and 2008,the mitigation distances of the gravity center of NPP were smaller, implying that the changes in NPP in each parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were relatively consistent in these three years.

The lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River are afected by the warm and wet airflow in the Indian Ocean. The forest cover is high and the NPP is high in rainforests, monsoon forests and broad-leaved forests.The NPP in most areas of the northern Tibet Plateau is relatively low because of the high altitude, low temperature,low precipitation and numerous vegetation types, such as grasslands, alpine meadows and sparse shrubs (Sun et al., 2014). Deserts and desert grasslands with the lowest NPP are widespread in the Ali Plateau because of the scarcity of annual precipitation and low temperature. During 2Ooo-2O04, the average annual NPP in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has shown an upward trend. After 2O04, the average annual NPP has shown a steep increase. This increase can be attributed to the fact that the forest lands and grasslands have been considerably restored after the implementation of the projects of \"returning farmland to grassland\" and \"returning grazing land to grassland\". The average annual NPP in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau presented a sharp increase in 20o5, with high fluctuations observed during 2005-2015. ",

In the central, northeastern and western parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, NPP was positively correlated with precipitation because the altitude of these regions was higher than $4 0 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ a.s.l.and the precipitation was low. Therefore, precipitation became the dominant factor that restricts the growth of vegetation. In addition, the grasslands and alpine meadows in these regions demonstrated a high sensitivity to precipitation (Yang et al.， 2O15). However， NPP was negatively correlated with precipitation in the southeastern part of the Hengduan Mountains, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin.Precipitation was abundant in these regions,so it was not the main factor that restricts the growth of vegetation. Because of the high levels of precipitation in these regions, the rainfall erosivity was high, the slope was steep and the soil erosion phenomena (freeze-thaw erosion and hydraulic erosion) were serious. In addition, the negative correlations between NPP and precipitation in some regions (especially in the Hengduan Mountains) were associated with lower solar radiation due to increased precipitation (Liu et al., 2Ol1). Thus, the regional vegetation ecosystem will be destroyed to a certain extent. ",

The regions that exhibited negative correlations between NPP and temperature were mainly concentrated in the central and northern parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau because of scarce precipitation in these regions. Although the increase in temperature was conducive to the plant photosynthesis, regional drought was exacerbated to a certain extent, inhibiting vegetation growth. ",

In the A2 region, however, a significant increase in temperature was observed due to the scarcity of precipitation, resulting in different degrees of drought and thus destroying the regional vegetation ecosystem. The human activity-dominant zone can also be divided into two parts: C1 (a region with the decrease in NPP induced by human activities) and C2 (a region with the increase in NPP induced by human activities). Grazing and farming were the main human activities in these regions. However, with the implementation of the ecological projects of \"returning farmland to grassland\" and \"returning grazing land to grassland\",the effects of human activities on the NPP changes in different regions showed different directions (inhibition or promotion). Overgrazing and reclamation played a leading role in the C1 region, whereas ecological protection policies played an essential role in the C2 region (Sun et al., 2014). In addition,in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, there existed an interaction zone (B) where the NPP changes were dominated by the combined effects of climate change and human activities.This region was a transitional zone in which human effects were gradually weakening while climate efects were gradually increasing. Thus, significant temporal and spatial differences can be observed in the relative effects of climate change and human activities on the NPP changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. ",
