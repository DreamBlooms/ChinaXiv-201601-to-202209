This paper discusses the issues that are pertinent to the design of a linear permanent magnet generator for application in a FPEC.To achieve the required high power density and low moving mass,a tubular machine equipped with modular windings and axially magnetized is considered to be the most appropriate.Finite Element Analysis are adopted to analyse the PMLG.Magnetic fielddistribution,EMF,thrust forceand Noload corl loss are obtained through the finite element method. An effective tool for design optimization is provided.It is shown that the machine design can be optimized with respect to three key dimensional ratios while satisfying other performance specifications.

This requirement is met particularly well by Free piston energy converter (FPEC)[2],[5],[6]. It is capable of transforming chemical energy into electrical energy by means of a combustion process. This is achieved by keeping the system frequency constant and adapting to the power demanded by variation of the stroke and compression. Furthermore,these system characteristics mean that the freepistonlineargenerator can beoperated with both conventional fuels such as petrol,diesel and gas and with alternative fuels such as sun fuel, synthetic fuel,hydrogen etc[7]-[9].
