        "text": "Recently, chromium based chalcogenide spinel ACr $_ 2$ Se $^ 4$ (A = Cu, Zn, Hg, Cr, Cd, etc) have been paid considerable attention due to exotic physical phenomena, such as Weyl semi-metal in HgCr $_ 2$ Se $^ 4$ [1,2],spin-orbit coupling in CdCr $2$ Se $^ 4$ [3],magnetoelectric effect or multiferocity in ZnCr $^ 2$ Se $^ 4$ [4, 5]. The ferromagnetic selenide CuCr $2$ Se $^ 4$ is special due to the theoretical prediction of high spin-polarization and exhibition of significant magneto-optic Kerr rotation, which make it a perspective material for spintronics [6-12]. The CuCr $_ 2$ Se $_ 4$ ， which holds an itinerant ferromagnetic ground state, displays the highest Curie temperature $\\mathit { \\Delta } ^ { \\prime } \\mathit { I } _ { C } ^ { \\prime }$ of 430 K among spinel chalcogenides [13]. It is suggested that the ferrimagnetic hybridization between localized $3 d ^ { 3 }$ electrons of $\\mathrm { C r ^ { 3 + } }$ ions and delocalized holes in Se $4 p$ band results into a hole-mediated exchange [12]. This scenario has been confirmed by density functional calculations and magneto-optical study, where the appearance of a hybridizationinduced hump-like band structure was observed at the Fermi energy only for the spin-up states [14,15]. Moreover, the thermopower experiment has deomostated that the carriers are of $p$ -type,which also supports the hole-mediated exchange mechanism [26]. ",

Therefore, the halogen doping in the Se-sites supplies an effective way to modulate transport and magnetic behaviors, such as the CuCr $2$ Se $_ { 4 - x }$ a $_ { x }$ and CuCr $^ 2$ Se $_ { 4 - x }$ Br $x$ systems [17-19]. The CuCr $^ 2$ Se $_ { 4 - x }$ Br $x$ is well known for the dissipationless Anomalous Hall current， where the density of holes decreases from $7 . 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 1 }$ $\\mathrm { c m ^ { - 1 } }$ for $x = 0$ to $1 . 9 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \\ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }$ for $x = 1 . 0$ [20, 21]. It is expected that the perfect half-metallic situation can be realized by tiny electron doping ( $1 0 \\sim 2 0 \\%$ doping of Br as predicted by Butler et al） [6]. With the doping of bromine, the resistivity of this system evolves from metallic behavior for $x = 0$ to insulating state for $x = 1$ ,where $x = 0 . 2 5$ （20 lies at the boundary [20]. Moreover,it has been demonstrated that the substitution of Brfor Se $^ -$ ions in CuCr se Br system leads to the shift of the Kerr effect maximum energy $2$ $_ { 4 - x }$ $x$ near 1 eV to the higher energy region around $x = 0 . 2 5$ [22].

All these parameters present periodic behaviors dependent on $\\varphi$ [as shown in Fig. 4(a), (b) and (c)], except the $I _ { E P R }$ [as shown Fig. 4 (d)]. The $H _ { r }$ is defined as the magnetic field value at $d P / d H = 0$ . In fact, the effective resonance field $H _ { r } ^ { e f f } = H _ { r } + H _ { i n t }$ ( $H _ { i n t }$ is the internal field caused by the ferromagnetic ordering). According to the in-plane magnetic ordering scenario,when $\\varphi = 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (in-plane), the magnetization is strongest， which result into the strong $H _ { i n t }$ .Thus,the needful $H _ { r }$ （20 is smaller. Contrarily, when $\\varphi = 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (out-of-plane), the $H _ { i n t }$ is weakest, the needful $H _ { r }$ is stronger.

In order to further investigate the magnetic interaction, the temperature dependence of EPR parameters are obtained. Due to the strong in-plane magnetization, the temperature dependence of inplane EPR parameters are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5 (a) gives the temperature dependence of $H _ { r }$ ，where the right axis plots the $g$ -factor.The $H _ { r }$ decreases with the decrease of temperature, corresponding to the increase of $g$ -factor with the decrease of temperature. No abrupt changes can be observed at $T _ { C }$ for the temperature dependence of $H _ { r }$ and $g$ -factor. The decrease of $H _ { r }$ may be due to the enhancement of the ferromagnetism with the decrease of temperature. An apparent change occurs to the temperature dependence of $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ at $T _ { C }$ ， as shown in Fig. 5 (b). As we know, the $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ is corresponding to the spin coupling with the environment. With the decrease of temperature, $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ decreases sharply at $\\mathit { \\Delta } T _ { C } ^ { \\prime } = 3 9 0 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ ： With further temperature cooling, $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ increases slightly with the decrease of temperature at a speed of 0.95 kOe/K. The abrupt decline of $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ indicates that drastic changes occur to the spin coupling with the surrounding environment due to the magnetic ordering transition. Above $\\mathit { \\Delta } ^ { \\prime } \\mathit { I } _ { \\mathit { C } } ^ { \\prime }$ in the paramagnetic phase, with temperature increasing, the thermal fluctuation of spins becomes stronger,which shorten the relaxation time $\\tau$ . According to the relation （204 $\\Delta H _ { p p } \\propto 1 / \\tau$ ， $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ will be broadened with the increase of temperature in the paramagnetic regime [29]. Below $T _ { C }$ in the ferromagnetic phase, the increase of $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ with temperature decreasing may be due to the enhancement of spin coupling. As we know, there exists strong spin-orbit coupling in this system [30]. Therefore, the increase of $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ indicates the increase of the spin-orbit coupling with the decrease of temperature. It is noticed that the increase speed of $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ in single crystal sample is much smaller than that in the polycrystalline CuCr $_ 2$ Se $^ 4$ (6.88 kOe/K) [31]. In a polycrystalline, $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ can be broadened due to the local dipolar feld of pores and pits [32], which indicates that much crystal boundaries and defects affect significantly on the broaden of $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ in the polycrystalline. In the single crystal, the increase of $\\Delta H _ { p p }$ is mainly determined by the spin-orbit coupling. Figure 5 (c） gives the temperature dependence of the EPR height, which shows a corresponding change at $T _ { C }$ due to the ferromagnetic ordering. Figure 5 (d) shows the temperature dependence of $I _ { E P R }$ ， which exhibits similar behavior as that in the polycrystal CuCr $2$ Se $^ 4$ [31].Generally, the $\\scriptstyle I _ { E P R }$ is determined by the number of paramagnetic ions participating into the resonance. In the paramagnetic region, the $I _ { E P R }$ is proportional to $1 / T$ .Below $T _ { C }$ , the ferromagnetic phase becomes dominant in this system, leading to the dramatic decrease of the number of paramagnetic ions. The decreasing number of paramagnetic ions is responsible for the decrease of $I _ { E P R }$ in low temperature range [31]. ",
