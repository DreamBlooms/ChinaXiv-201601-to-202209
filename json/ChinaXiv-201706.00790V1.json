The internal flows of both with and without cavitations are analyzed using the CFX.The characteristics of unsteady pressure on the blade surfaces and the symmetric plane of the volute are presented and compared.The results show that the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations of critical cavitation on the blade pressure surface (PS)are bigger as compared with those at the non-cavitation condition,but on the suction surface (SS),the situation ison the contrary.When cavitation occurs,reduction ofload in the impeller is a result. In the present study,such reduction of load is observed mainly on the first halfof the blades.Pressure fluctuations at five monitoring points,denoted byWK1 to WK5 in the volute,are also analyzed.No matterat the critical cavitation or at the non-cavitation conditions,the monitored pressure fluctuations are at the same frequencies,which equal to the blade passing frequency (BPF)and its multiples.However,the amplitudes of the fluctuations at critical cavitation condition are considerably stronger, as compared with those for without cavitation.

Comparing the pressure modes in the frequency domain, a peak value is firstly found at BPF at monitoring point WK1 which is near the tongue of the volute.
