        "text": "DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (DSBs), has long been considered a major initiator of cellular responses to ionizing radiation. Since even a single unrepaired DSB can be lethal to a cell,detection and removal of these lesions are important cellular functions; their presence rapidly results in the recruitment of DNA repair machinery to the damage sites and triggers multiple signaling events (l2). The activation of multiple signal pathways,including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),ultimately leads to altered gene expression with secondary effects on cell signaling response and effector genes (l3). Previous studies have shown that many MAPK signal pathway kinases,including JNK,ERK1/2 and $\\mathtt { p } 3 8$ participate in radiation-induced bystander effects $( l 4 )$ ，and that p21 expression could be regulated via p53 and MEK/ ERK1/2 MAPK pathways to control cell proliferation after DNA damage $( l 5 )$ .Signaling from strand break-related damage can in turn result in cell cycle arrest, enhancement of DNA repair capacity or activation of apoptotic pathways when damage cannot be repaired.In this study,we examined the induction of $\\gamma { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { H } 2 \\mathrm { A X }$ foci formation，micronuclei formation and protein expression of signal pathways in wild-type MEFs, $\\mathrm { p } 2 1 ^ { - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { + / + }$ MEFs and $\\mathrm { p } 2 \\mathrm { l } ^ { - / - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { - / - }$ MEFs,to elucidate the role of p21 and Hus1 in production and transmission of radiation-induced damage signal pathways involved in bystander effects.

Cells deficient in the Husl gene failed to proliferate in vitro,but inactivation of p21 allowed for the continued growth of Hus1-deficient cells,indicating a close relationship between p21 and Hus1 $( l I )$ . In the current study，using wild-type MEFs, $\\mathrm { p } 2 1 ^ { - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { + / + }$ MEFs and $\\mathrm { p } 2 1 ^ { - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { - \\prime - }$ MEFs，we investigated the roles of $\\mathsf { p } 2 1$ and Hus1 in production and transmission of bystander signals. The irradiated wild-type MEFs could produce bystander signals in neighboring nonirradiated cells through gap junction channels and soluble extracellular factors， that induced $\\gamma { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { H } 2 \\mathrm { A X }$ foci formation and micronuclei formation in bystander cells.The irradiated $\\mathrm { p } 2 1 ^ { - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { + / + }$ MEFs could not induce $\\gamma { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { H } 2 \\mathrm { A X }$ foci formation and micronuclei formation in neighboring nonirradiated cells,while irradiated $\\mathrm { p } 2 \\mathrm { l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { - - }$ MEFs restored the ability to induce $\\gamma \\mathrm { . }$ H2AX foci formation and micronuclei formation in nonirradiated neighboring cells,and these increases could be inhibited through transfecting Hus1-expression plasmid into $\\mathrm { p } 2 \\mathrm { l } ^ { - / - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { - / - }$ MEFs.These results indicated that the loss of p21 resulted in the absence of bystander effects after irradiation,while the inactivation of Hus1 in p21-deficient cells recovered the bystander effects (Fig.1).We also found that these effects were not specific to alpha-particle radiation and were also observed after 4 Gy gamma irradiation (Supplementary Fig. S1； http://dx.doi.org/10. 1667/RR14165.1.S1)， suggesting that these effects were independent of radiation type and LET. Previous studies by Azzam et al. showed that low-dose alpha-particles irradiation could increase p21 expression in nonirradiated bystander cells (3，26). Hus1 is required for the S-phase checkpoint (27)，and loss of Hus1 leads to defects in genotoxin-induced signaling to Chk1 and in significantly increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU） and ultraviolet (UV) light, but in only minor effects on radiation sensitivity $( I I )$ . Thus,the lack of bystander response in p21-deficient cells could be dye to eithera defect in theirability to mount the response,that is,to generate the signal after irradiation, or from a defect in their ability to respond to such bystander signals.We addressed this question by performing media transfer experiments in cells with different genetic backgrounds,which functioned interchangeably in all possible permutations as either bystander signal producers or signal responders.The results of these experiments indicated that while wild-type MEFs were able to produce and respond to bystander signals, $\\mathrm { p } 2 \\mathrm { l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { + / + }$ MEFs were unable to generate bystander signals，but retained the ability to respond to such signals (Fig. 3).

In addition, regulation of gap junctions would affect the radiation-induced bystander effects (3).The current study additionally demonstrated that the GJIC plays an important roles in mediating ionizing radiation-induced bystander effects，as we clearly showed that the gapjunction channel inhibitor,lindane,inhibited the modest bystander response observed in $\\mathrm { p } 2 \\mathrm { l } ^ { - } \\mathrm { H u s } 1 ^ { - \\prime - }$ MEFs (Fig. 2).

To determine the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon，we investigated the activation of MAPKs pathways including JNK1/2, ERK1/2 and $\\mathsf { p } 3 8$ in current study. Multiple MAPK pathways are activated by exposure to ionizing radiation, and play crucial roles in controlling cell survival and repopulation effects after irradiation(7).It has also been reported that activation of MAPKs is coordinated with an increase in $\\mathsf { p } 2 1$ expression (l5).Park et al.found that phosphorylations of ERK1/2 and $\\mathrm { J N K } 1 / 2$ were involved in regulating the phosphorylation of $\\mathrm { C x } 4 3$ in mouse cells $( 3 I )$ .In addition, $\\mathsf { p } 3 8$ was shown to be involved in ionizing radiation-induced bystander effects, together with NF- $\\mathbf { \\nabla \\kappa } \\kappa \\mathbf { B }$ -regulating COX-2 activity (32).

Taken together，we hypothesize that the loss of p21 resulted in deficiency in activation of MAPK signal pathways,leading to deficiency in the production of bystander signals and the absence of bystander effects after alpha-particle irradiation.However, further loss of Hus1 in p21-deficient cells restored the activation of MAPK signal pathways and restoredthe bystander effects.
