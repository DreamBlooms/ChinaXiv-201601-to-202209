It was found that with rising strain the sample resistance and the magnetic field sensitivity are increased and decreased, respectively，due to the irregular cracking structure and the induced shapeanisotropy.13 The experimental and theoretical works have shown that the applied strain can tune the magnetization orientation of the ferromagnetic layers in a spin valve via the inverse magnetostrictive effect and significantly destabilize its GMR performance.16,18-27 Therefore, how to simultaneously achieve a desired stretchability and a stable magnetic field sensitivity with strain is still a great challenge for flexible magnetic sensors.

The strain-engineered wrinkles signifcantly promote the stretchability and the strain stability of the GMR sensor.37 In this study, we employed a strain-relief architecture based on the strain-engineered wrinkles to fabricate flexible magnetoelectronics.The architecture is composed of both selfassembled periodic wrinkles and parallel ribbons and can be realized simply by direct sputtering with metal mask on prestrained PDMS substrates.In this structure,the biaxial strain accompanying with stretching operation (the uniaxial applied tensile strain and the induced transverse compressive strain due to the Poisson effect) can be accommodated, thus significantly reducing the influence of the residual strain on the GMR performance. Moreover, we employ a dual spin valve structure, which has been demonstrated to show the higher GMR ratio and higher magnetic field sensitivity than those of the conventional simple spin valve because of the spin dependent scateringonthebothsidesofthefreelayer84toostruct the multilayer magnetic sensor. Different to the GMR multilayer-based magnetic sensor， the dual spin-valve sensor is appropriate for detecting weak field with high magnetic field sensitivity.The strain stability of GMR performance also benefits from the symmetric dual spin valve structure,where the magnetic free layer and the $\\mathtt { C u }$ spacer layer are located in the center of the film with nearly zero bending strain.Finally, an almost constant GMR ratio of $9 . 9 \\%$ ,arather stable magnetic field sensitivity of $0 . 6 9 \\% / \\mathrm { O e } ,$ and the nearly unchanged zero field resistance were obtained under a tensile stretch up to ${ \\sim } 2 5 \\%$ ， making the strain-relief structure a promising architecture for manufacturing fully flexible electronics.

Figure lc shows a schematic drawing of the asfabricated wrinkled spin valve ribbons(SVR)，where the direction of the well-defined periodic wrinkles is perpendicular to the ribbons and parallel to the exchange bias.According to the Poisson effect，as the prestrain is released，the PDMS substrate displays an elongation $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { L } }$ in the lateral direction (perpendicular to the prestrain),which can be written as $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { L } } =$ $\\nu _ { \\mathrm { p D M S } } \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { p r e } } = 0 . 5 \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { p r e } } ,$ where $\\nu _ { \\mathrm { P D M S } } = 0 . 5$ is the Poisson ratio of PDMS.42 Accordingly, the lateral tensile strains in the $3 0 \\%$ and $5 0 \\%$ prestrained thin films are $1 5 \\%$ and $2 5 \\%$ ，respectively, which by far exceed the stretching limit of metallic thin films. Consequently，as a reference shown in Figure S2a of the Supporting Information, the film fabricated without the ribbon mask seriously cracks along the prestrain after releasing the prestrain. Therefore,the lateral tensile strain by the Poisson effect is devastating and should be avoided during the fabrication.In contrast，cracks are not observed in the measurement range up to $3 \\times 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ in both SVR samples fabricated with the $3 0 \\%$ and $5 0 \\%$ prestrains ( $S \\mathrm { V R } { - } 3 0 \\%$ and $S \\mathrm { V R - } 5 0 \\%$ ).They exhibit a uniform wavy structure over a large area of a few square centimeters (Figure ld).This is because most of the induced lateral tensile strain by the Poisson effect is released through the bared PDMS area where is much softer than that covered by the metallic multilayers.

The information about periodicity (wavelength） of the SVR in the real space is simply reduced to a set of bright spots in the frequency space.The first order spot,whose distance to center is inversely proportional to the wavelength,is circled in red.As seen, their wavelength is almost constant when the tensile strain increases from O to $4 0 \\%$ .When the applied tensile strain approaches and exceeds the prestrain, the wavelength gradually increases due to the plastic deformation of the metallic SVRs (see the FFT images for the cases of $5 0 \\%$ and $6 0 \\%$ applied stains).In addition，the image contrast between the wrinkle peak and the wrinkle trench is lowered with increasing applied tensile strain,reflecting that the wrinkles are flattened by the tensile stretching.In case of the applied tensile strain less than the prestrain，SVRs remain continuous and the wrinkling structure can be reversibly changed.When the applied tensile strain is smaller than the prestrain,the SVRs exhibit a good continuity with a nearly constant wavelength of $8 . 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (Figure 2b).

The sample of $S \\mathrm { V R - } 0 \\%$ grown without prestrain is very brittle and cracks seriously under an applied tensile strain even less than $2 \\% ,$ ，and the GMR signal becomes noisy (Supporting Information，Figure S3).In a stark contrast，for either the periodically wrinkled $S \\mathrm { V R } { - } 3 0 \\%$ or $S \\mathrm { V R - } 5 0 \\%$ ，when applying a tensile strain of $2 5 \\%$ ，the measured GMR curves are almost unchanged (Figure $^ { 3 \\mathrm { b } , \\mathrm { c } } ,$ ),signifying that the GMR performance of the wrinkled SVRs is insensitive to the stretching operation.

In previous works, when stretching a magnetic sensor, the strain-induced magnetic anisotropy in the magnetic layer due to the inverse magnetostrictive effect significantlydeteriorated itsmagneticfieldsensitivity.6,13 However,in our case,the large stretching tensile strain and the induced lateral compressive strain are released through the combined periodic wrinkling and parallel ribbon structures.The residual strain in the magnetic layer is negligible,and therefore, a constant magnetic field sensitivity can be achieved during stretching the SVRs.With further increasing the applied tensile strain beyond $2 5 \\%$ ，the GMR ratio and the magnetic field sensitivity become a little fluctuating.However, the zero field resistance continues to increase with rising tensile strain. The $S \\mathrm { V R - } 5 0 \\%$ displays a similar strain dependent behavior as the $S \\mathrm { V R } { - } 3 0 \\%$ .The almost constant GMR ratio of $7 . 9 \\%$ ，the magnetic field sensitivity of $0 . 4 \\% / \\mathrm { O e } ,$ and the zero field resistance of $9 2 \\Omega$ are achieved in the tensile strain range of $^ { 0 - }$ $2 5 \\%$ (Figure $3 \\mathrm { d - f ) }$ .It is found that the onset points for the distinct increase of the zero field resistance and the obvious fluctuations of the GMR ratio and the magnetic sensitivity in both $S \\mathrm { V R } { - } 3 0 \\%$ and $S \\mathrm { V R - } 5 0 \\%$ are roughly superimposed at a tensile strain of ${ \\sim } 2 5 \\%$ .Weascribe thisdeteriorationof GMR performance to the destabilization of wire contact at the high strain state (see Methods section for details).As a result, especially for the sample of $S \\mathrm { V R } { - } 5 0 \\%$ ，theexperimentally observed stretchability is lower than our expectation that the stretchability should be close to the prestrain.

        "text": "the width of metallic SVRs remains unchanged.This behavior is verified by the optical measurements shown in Figure $^ { 5 \\mathrm { b } , }$ indicating a negligible residual lateral strain in the as-fabricated SVRs.Obviously, the SVR ribbon/width ratio $( W _ { \\mathrm { S V R } } / W _ { \\mathrm { P D M S } } )$ playsan important role in determining the stretchability of the SVRs.A peak force quantitative nanomechanical atomic force microscopy (PF-QNM AFM） characterization was performed to investigate the mechanical stability of the wrinkled SVRs grown with different $W _ { \\mathrm { S V R } } / W _ { \\mathrm { P D M S } }$ and prestrains.45-48 Note that the elastic modulus of PDMS in an ultrahigh strain state is no longer constant but parabolically increases as the applied strainincreases.950FortheSVRgrowwiththe $W _ { \\mathrm { S V R } } / W _ { \\mathrm { P D M S } }$ of $1 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } / 2 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and without the prestrain， the elastic modulus in PDMS measured in the Derjaguin-MullerToporov (DMT） model is constant and uniform (Figure Sc), suggesting there is no strain concentration in the uncovered PDMS area.However,as the tensile prestrain is increased to $5 0 \\%$ (Figure Sd)，the elastic modulus of PDMS gradually increases when approaching the SVR/PDMS boundary.For the sample in Figure Se,the tensile prestrain keeps at $5 0 \\%$ ，but $W _ { \\mathrm { S V R } } / W _ { \\mathrm { P D M S } }$ changes to $4 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } / 2 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ It is found that the elastic modulus ofPDMS at the PDMS/SVRboundary is much higher than that in the central area,indicating an aggravated strain concentration at the SVR/PDMS boundary. Since the occurrence of cracks is determined by the strain-energy release rate that is proportional to $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { P D M S } } ^ { \\mathrm { } } ^ { 2 }$ ，the earliest cracking sites should be located at the PDMS/SVR boundaries.49-51 When the lateral tensile strain in PDMS surpasses a critical value,a lot of microcracks are formed on the edge of the SVR (Figure Se). To conclude,the mechanical stability of the strain-engineered SVRs is governed by the prestrain as well as the ribbon width ratio.Accordingly,in the experiment we designed the samples of $S \\mathrm { V R } { - } 3 0 \\%$ and $S \\mathrm { V R - } 5 0 \\%$ with the $W _ { \\mathrm { S V R } } / W _ { \\mathrm { P D M S } }$ of $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m / }$ $2 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ which are crack-resistant and highly stable under a large tensile strain.

The obtained PDMS substrate was $3 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick with a surface roughness of $0 . 3 3 \\ \\mathrm { ~ n m }$ (Supporting Information， Figure S1a). The PDMS substrate was prestretched and fixed on a homemade stretching apparatus (Supporting Information, Figure S1b).Then, the sputter deposition of the dual spin valve on prestretched PDMS substrate by usinga band-like shadow mask(Figure lb）was carried out in a 6- target ultrahigh-vacuum magnetron sputtering system.A couple of permanent magnets placed on the both sides of the substrates provided an in-plane magnetic field of $8 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { O e }$ during the sputtering deposition to induce an exchange bias perpendicular to the prestrain direction.Finally,after deposition,removing the shadow mask softly and releasing the prestrain resulted in wrinkled SVRs (Supporting Information,Figure S1c).The surface morphology was characterized bya Zeisss confocal laser scanning microscope and a Bruker's multifunctional scanning probe microscope.The elastic modulus was measured bya PF-QNM AFM in the DMT model.To measure the GMR properties by 4-wire method,platinum wires with $3 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in diameter were adhered to the wrinkled SVRs using high conductive silver paste and then heated at $7 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ on a hot plate for $^ { 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ Tensile strain was in situ applied through a homemade stretching apparatus with a micrometer screw gauge on it,which can modulate the tensile strain in a precise of $0 . 2 \\%$ 、In this experiment, the stretching of the SVR thin films covered under silver paste electrode was obviously confined.During the stretching measurements, the high concentration of strain around the electrodes caused the fractures in SVRs,resulting in an early failure of the devices before reaching the stretching limit.
