However, efects of soil water content and nitrogen on soil carbon mineralization after   \n15 ryegrass incorporation are not fully understood.The present study was to investigate the effect of soil water content and nitrogen rate on soil carbon mineralization after ryegrass incorporated into upland red soil (Ferralsols).A laboratory experiment was established, including soil water contents $[ 1 5 \\%$ (W1), $30 \\%$ (W2), $45 \\%$ (W3)] and nitrogen rates [0 (N1), $6 0 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g } ( \\mathrm { N } 2 )$ ， $1 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g ( N } 3 ) ]$ . The results showed that the highest soil carbon mineralization accumulation was observed in W3N3.Nitrogen application inhibited carbon mineralization rate and accumulation in the late stage of ryegrass incorporation at W1,but increased carbon mineralization rate and accumulation at W2.With increasing soil water content, nitrogen application could improve soil carbon mineralization at the early stage of ryegrass incorporation. In conclusion, soil nitrogen and water content could regulate soil carbon mineralization. Considering to reduce the soil $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions, rational nitrogen application should be taken seriously during cover crop (ryegrass) incorporated into the upland red soil. ",

        "text": "oil organic carbon has a significant important role in the global carbon cycle(Bailey et al. 2018). Soil carbon decomposition and sequestration is mainly affected by cropping systems(Moreno-Cornejo et al. 2015), tillage methods,cover crops(Poeplau and Don 2015), organic manure and chemical fertilizer(Lehmann and Kleber 2O15) in field. Soil carbon mineralization is limited by environmental factors, such as field moisture capacity(O'Connell et al. 2016), temperature(Giardina and Ryan 2000), climate(Luo et al. 2017), etc. Soil water content impacts soil oxygen, which would inhibit soil microbial activity,and finally affected soil carbon mineralization(Rivas et al. 2014). The influences of exogenous nitrogen input on soil carbon mineralization varied with environmental factors(Coucheney et al. 2O13). The major objects of present documents are forest (Fisk et al. 2O15), wetland(Zheng et al. 2018), grassland(Poeplau et al. 20l7) and cropland(Das et al. 2019), but there are few reports about effects of soil water content and nitrogen rate on soil carbon mineralization after cover crop incorporated into red soil.

Ryegrass, as a forage grass or cover crop,has high cold resistance, high biomass production, and rich nutritional value. Sowing ryegrass could mitigate nitrous oxide emissions(Pilecco et al. 2019) and remediate contaminated soil(Li et al. 2020). Ryegrass incorporation could improve crop yield and soil quality in paddy field(Yang 1996), ryegrass residues could also lower soil $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions and increase soil C stocks(Mwafulirwa et al. 2019).Soil carbon mineralization is an important indicator for measuring soil quality(GilSotres et al. 2005). Planting ryegrass as cover crop after sweet corn harvested in late October, and incorporated into soil in next early April, was it beneficial to improve soil quality? Our results showed that applied chemical nitrogen fertilizer $( 6 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g / k g } )$ could inhibit ryegrass decomposition and nitrogen release(Yang et al. 2018), and soil nitrogen mineralization(Wang et al. 2018) at the early stage of ryegrass incorporation, which might alleviate the loss of soil nitrogen.

The soil enzyme activity is a key factor in the decomposition of soil organic mater, it might limit by low soil water content(Marschner and Kalbitz 2O03).
