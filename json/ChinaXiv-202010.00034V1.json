        "text": "Abstract: The shear stress generated by the wind on the land surface is the driving force that results in the wind erosion of the soil. It is an independent factor influencing soil wind erosion. The factors related to wind erosivity, known as submodels, mainly include the weather factor (WF) in revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ),the erosion submodel (ES) in wind erosion prediction system (WEPS),as wellas the drift potential (DP) in wind energy environmental assessment. However, the essential factors of WF and ES contain wind, soil characteristics and surface coverings, which therefore results in the interdependence between WF or ES and other factors (e.g., soil erodible factor) in soil erosion models. Considering that DP is a relative indicator of the wind energy environment and does not have the value of expressing wind to induce shear stresson the surface. Therefore,a new factor is needed to express accurately wind erosivity. Based on the theoretical basis that the soil loss by wind erosion $\\boldsymbol { \\mathcal { Q } } )$ is proportional to the shear stress of the wind on the soil surface,a new model of wind driving force (WDF) was established, which expresses the potential capacity of wind to drive soil mass in per unit area and a period of time. Through the calculations in the typical area,the WDF, WF and DP are compared and analyzed from the theoretical basis, construction goal, problem-solving ability and typical area application; the spatial distribution of soil wind erosion intensity was concurrently compared with the spatial distributions of the WDF, WF and DP values in the typical area. The results indicate that the WDF is better to reflect the potential capacity of wind erosivity than WF and DP,and that the WDF model is a good model with universal applicability and can be logically incorporated into the soil wind erosion models.

        "text": "The wind is the driving force of soil wind erosion. When the shear stress exerted on the soil surface by wind exceeds the ability of soil to resist detachment, soil wind erosion occurs (Skidmore,1986). Therefore， wind velocity is regarded as an important variable in soil wind erosion models (Woodruff and Siddoway,1965; Hagen et al., 1996; Fryrear et al., 1998). Since the shear stress of the wind on the soil surface is an important factor determining the soil loss by wind erosion, the relationship between the soil loss by wind erosion $( Q )$ and the shear stress $( \\tau )$ of the wind on the soil surface is generally written as $Q \\propto ( \\tau ^ { 1 / 2 } - \\tau _ { t } ^ { 1 / 2 } ) \\tau$ (Lettau and Lettau, 1978), or $Q \\propto ( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } ) \\tau ^ { 1 / 2 }$ (Sauermann et al., 2001), or $Q \\propto ( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } )$ (Anderson and Haff, 1988; Andreotti, 2004; Duran and Herrmann, 2006; Martin and Kok, 2017), where $\\scriptstyle \\tau = \\rho _ { \\mathrm { g } } u *$ $\\tau _ { t } { = } \\rho _ { \\mathrm { g } } u * _ { t }$ $\\tau$ and $\\tau _ { t }$ expressed in $\\mathrm { N } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . Here, $\\tau _ { t }$ is the critical shear stress when wind erosion occurs, $\\rho _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ is the density of air $( \\mathrm { k g } / \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } )$ , and $u *$ and $\\boldsymbol { u } * _ { t }$ are the friction velocity and the critical friction velocity $\\mathrm { { ( m / s ) } }$ , respectively. When the soil wind erosion reaches steady state, $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ represents the soil particle flux in per unit width and unit time. Previous studies have shown that the number of soil particles $( N )$ that is driven by the wind in the unit area and unit time is also positively correlated with $\\left( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } \\right)$ (Cheng et al., 2007).

        "text": "Because of many factors affecting soil wind erosion, previous studies often took the factors, such as surface crop residue coverage, crop upright biomass, surface soil moisture, precipitation and evaporation, into account when describing the wind erosivity, and called wind erosivity as the weather factor (WF) (FAO et al.,1979; Hagen et al., 1996), or the erosion submodel (ES) (Hagen et al.,1996). The problem is that WF and ES do not exclusively express wind erosivity, but rather combine wind erosivity with the intrinsic properties of the soil (e.g., soil moisture) and surface attachments (e.g., crop residues) (Zou et al.,2O14). In fact, wind erosivity depends on the wind velocity determined by the weather process and does not change with other factors influencing soil wind erosion. Roughness elements on the surface (such as plants and ridges) only re-transform the wind velocity of the near-surface layer. From the perspective of wind erosion dynamics, it is necessary to study the energy relationship between wind and soil, and the factors affecting soil wind erosion can be divided into air, surface and soil(Chepil, 1945). During the soil wind erosion process, the properties and mechanical attributes of each influencing factor are different. According to the atributes that are favorable or unfavorable to soil wind erosion, and the principles of similar mechanical properties exhibited during soil wind erosion process, the three categories of factors, which are air, surface roughness and soil, represent wind erosivity factors, roughness interference factors and soil anti-erodibility factors, respectively (Zou et al., 2O15). Corresponding to the three categories of factors are wind driving force (WDF), roughness interference force (RIF) and soil anti-erodibility force (SAF), respectively (Zou et al.， 2O14). Studying the energy relationship between wind and soil is of great significance during the process of soil wind erosion (Chepil, 1945). The purpose of establishing the WDF model is to distinguish the wind driving force from soil characteristics and roughness factors affecting soil wind erosion. ",

In the soil wind erosion models, the WDF should be an independent variable or a submodel, which is spatially located above the soil surface,and is in contact with the surface roughness elements and soil surface. In terms of mechanical properties, the WDF reflects the potential for wind to produce shear stress on the soil surface and causes the displacement of soil particles away from their original positions (Zou et al., 2O14). For a given area, soil wind erosion also has a time scale, which means that the WDF must match the unit area and time scale. Therefore, when establishing the WDF model, the focus of attention must be the accumulative shear stress generated by the wind on the surface per unit area in unit time or a given period. In general, the WDF is defined as the accumulative shear stress generated by wind on a surface per unit area in one year $\\mathrm { ( P a \\ h / a ) }$ ： ",

Since $u *$ exhibits different intensities on soil wind erosion, the resulting values of $\\tau$ will therefore differ. Consequently, in each wind erosion event, the value of $u *$ must be divided into several grades. Previous studies showed that the wind velocity variations in soil wind erosion areas in China and abroad are consistent with this assumption (Hagen et al.,1996; Fryrear et al., 1998; Yuan et al., 2018), even globally (Dai and Deser, 1999).

The model also assumes that when soil wind erosion is at steady state, the soil wind erosion rate $( \\mathrm { k g } / ( \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { s } ) )$ refers to the ratio of the aeolian sand flux $\\mathrm { ( k g / ( m { \\cdot } s ) ) }$ by the length of the plot $\\mathrm { ( m ) }$ , which represents the soil loss by wind erosion per unit area per unit time. In order to verify the objectivity of this hypothesis, it is necessary to start by clarifying the following two basic concepts. Firstly, Bagnold (1941) initially proposed the aeolian sand flux $Q \\propto \\tau ^ { 3 / 2 }$ . To avoid meaningless result calculated from $Q \\propto \\tau ^ { 3 / 2 }$ when $\\tau { < } \\tau _ { t }$ ,the forms of $Q \\propto ( \\tau ^ { 1 / 2 } - \\tau _ { t } ^ { 1 / 2 } ) \\tau$ and $Q \\propto ( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } ) \\tau ^ { 1 / 2 }$ were later proposed (Lettau and Lettau, 1978; Sauermann et al., 2Oo1), these equations are overall expressed as $Q \\propto \\tau ^ { 3 / 2 }$ . Secondly, In order to reveal in essence the relationship between the shear stress of the wind acting on the soil surface and the $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ ,the $Q \\propto ( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } )$ form was proposed (Anderson and Haff, 1988; Andreoti, 2004; Duran and Herrmann, 2006; Martin and Kok, 2017), where $( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } )$ was the effective instantaneous shear stress of the wind acting on the soil surface $\\mathrm { ( N / m } ^ { 2 } )$ · $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ was the particle mass of the soil surface that is the instantaneously driven by the wind in the unit area under the action of $( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } )$ . When the soil wind erosion is at steady state, the particle mass on the soil surface that is driven by the wind per unit area per unit time is completely transported by the wind. Therefore, the $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ in the aeolian sand flux equations $Q \\propto \\tau ^ { 3 / 2 }$ $Q \\propto ( \\tau ^ { 1 / 2 } - \\tau _ { t } ^ { 1 / 2 } ) \\tau$ and $Q \\propto ( \\tau { - } \\tau _ { t } ) \\tau ^ { 1 / 2 }$ divided by the length of the plot represents essentially the soil wind erosion rate.

        "text": "In the 'appropriate time scale', the soil wind erosion process is considered to be at steady state. The 'appropriate time scale' here is a variable, and its specific value is determined by the duration of monitoring soil wind erosion. For example, it can be 5 or $1 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ when monitoring soil wind erosion in a day or a month in a limited area, and it can be an hour when monitoring inter-annual soil wind erosion in a large area. The point of this hypothesis is that since the wind is always in a turbulent pulsating state by nature, which may induce the soil wind erosion rate to have strong pulsating and intermittent characteristics, it is very difficult to strictly define whether or not the soil wind erosion is at steady state (Zou et al.,2O19). Hence, both the wind velocity is in turbulent conditions, and aeolian sand flux have time-scale effects (Duran et al., 2O11; Martin et al., 2O13; Mayaud et al, 2017). This means that for a specific turbulent wind, there is a good correlation between wind velocity and aeolian sand flux in the average value of a certain time period (Butterfield,1991,1998, 1999; Wang and Zheng, 2O13). Therefore, the so-called steady state is actually only limited to a relatively short period of time in which the soil wind erosion rate fluctuates within a smal range. For the study of soil wind erosion process, the length of the time period is the decisive factor in determining the 'appropriate time scale'. Currently, the 'appropriate time scale' is usually ranges from 5 to 10 min (Udo,2O16; Shang et al., 2017) in a day or a few days,and an hour in the interannual time period (The Office of the First National Water Resources Census Leading Group of the State Council, 2010).

The WDF is an independent driving force of soil wind erosion. RIF is the re-transformation of the WDF by various roughness elements attached to the surface, which therefore weakens the WDF and acts in opposition with the space located above the soil surface. SAF is a force that the soil itself possesses against the WDF and is determined by factors including the soil physical and chemical properties,as wellas the plant roots.

Amongst these influencing factors, some are favourable and will promote soil wind erosion, while others are unfavourable and will have a rather inhibitory effect. The wind is the only factor that plays a positive role in promoting soil wind erosion (Skidmore, 1986). The WDF proposed herein has a clear physical meaning and contains not only the force of the wind acting on the soil surface but also the duration of this force, which is essentially the impulse generated by the wind on the soil surface per unit area and its duration. However, the physical meaning of other parameters related to the WDF currently in use is not clear. For example, WF in the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) is expressed in $\\mathrm { k g / m }$ (Fryrear et al., 1998), and the unit of the drift potential (DP) expressing the wind energy environment is in the cubic of per nautical mile per hour, that is (n mile/h)³ (Fryberger and Dean, 1979).

In other areas, the soil wind erosion intensity can be significantly affected by mountains, vegetation and precipitation, which is not conducive to distinguish the impacts of wind erosivity on soil wind erosion intensity. Figure 6 indicates that the WDF is the best fitted with soil wind erosion intensity in spatial distribution, DP is moderately, and WF is the worst. The west part of the Taklimakan Desert is affected by the loose sediments of the dry lake basin and represents a higher level of soil wind erosion intensity, which is slightly different from the performance of the WDF. In the calculation of DP, the weight $( W _ { i } )$ of the wind velocity level is artificially added, the higher the wind velocity level, the greater the weight, which results in the differences between the maximum and minimum values of DP to be improperly enlarged.

        "text": "In the existing soil wind erosion models, the factor or called submodel expressing wind erosivity is not ndependent variable, which makes the theoretical basis of these models unreliable. Each soil wind erosion event is a random event that occurs within a certain period of time. The WDF model is a variable in the soil wind erosion model, which is a type of random event. The independence of random events is a unique and very important concept in probability theory. The theoretical basis for establishing any model is that several variables should be independent of each other. According to the definition, the WDF does not depend on any other influencing factors of soil wind erosion; that is, the WDF model is an independent variable. Therefore, it meets the modeling requirements of the soil wind erosion model, and overcomes the limitations that WF and ES present in combining wind and soil moisture as well as crop residues (Hagen et al., 1996; Fryrear et al., 1998).

        "text": "From the perspective of the earth surface material cycle process, which contains three links of erosion, transportation and deposition, erosion is the first link. As a type of soil erosion, soil wind erosion should not include the process that the eroded soil particles are transported and deposited by the wind. Therefore, it is defined as 'the process of wind force causing the topsoil particles to detach the original spatial position' (Zou et al., 2O14). The difference between soil wind erosion and soil loss by wind is that the latter is a concept with time and spatial scale (Zou et al., 2015), which not only reflects the results of wind erosion but also shows the transportation and settlement results of the eroded particles (Zhang et al., 2O18). In this paper, based on the theoretical basis of $Q \\propto \\tau$ , the WDF model precisely expresses the potential capacity of soil particle mass per unit area to be driven by the wind in a certain period of time.

        "text": "The WDF model was established under the theoretical framework of the dynamic models of soil wind erosion (Zou et al., 2O15) and had a clear physical meaning rather than a statistical model based on experimental data. Because the WDF, RIF and SAF were strictly distinguished, all the three are independent of each other. The WDF can be logically incorporated into the soil wind erosion model and is more applicable than WF, ES and DP. The comparison results of spatial distributions of the WDF, WF and DP with that of soil wind erosion intensity in the typical area are strong evidences (Fig. 6). In practical applications, for an area where $\\boldsymbol { u } * _ { t }$ can be determined, in order to eliminate the impacts of the data of $u * _ { i } < u * _ { t }$ on the WDF calculation results, $u *$ values of $\\geq \\boldsymbol { u } * _ { t }$ are selected to participate in the calculation of the WDF. The WDF model lays a reliable theoretical foundation for the establishment of the dynamic models of soil wind erosion. ",
