        "text": "Saccade-induced retrieval enhancement (SIRE) refers to the phenomenon that active engaging of horizontal eye movements before recall would enhance subsequent memory performance (Lyle & Martin,201O). Christman,Garvey, Propper, and Phaneuf (2003) firstly described SIRE,in that study, participants were asked to learn a word list first, then guided to visually follow a black dot on the screen which moved horizontally for 30 seconds before recalling the word list. Their results showed a higher sensitivity ( $[ { \\mathsf { d } } ^ { \\prime }$ in signal detection theory) following horizontal saccades relative to no eye movements. Since then， SIRE has been examined in many studies, most of these studies found that horizontal saccades promoted recognition (Christman,Garvey， Propper,& Phaneuf, 20O3,Experiment 1;Parker, Relph，& Dagnall, 2008; Lyle,Logan,& Roediger, 2008),free recall (Lyle & Edlin,2015; Lyle,Logan,& Roediger, 2008; Nieuwenhuis et al.，2013; Parker, Relph,& Dagnall 2008; Samara, Elzinga, Slaghuter, Nieuwenhuis, 2011),reduced false memories (Christman, Propper,& Dion, 2004; Parker& Dagnal,2012),and facilitated autobiographical memory(Christman,Garvey, Propper, & Phaneuf, 2003, Experiment 2; Christman, Propper,& Brown,2006; Parker & Dagnall, 2010; Parker, Parkin,& Dagnall,2013).

        "text": "Nonetheless, SIRE has been challenged by some other empirical evidence.For example, a pre-registered collaborative study failed to replicate the enhancing effect of horizontal saccades on memory retrieval and reported contradictory results,i.e., compared with the no eye movement condition, participants' free recallperformance after induced eye movements was even worse (Matzke et al., 2015). In addition, whether horizontal saccades are necessary in SIRE remained unclear. Vertical saccades which were often used as the control condition were also found to enhance words recognition (compared with no eye movement condition, $\\begin{array} { r } { d = 0 . 6 8 \\mathrm { : } } \\end{array}$ ）(Lyle et al., 2008; also see Parker et al., 2008). Furthermore, handedness has also been suggested to be an important factor that would affect SIRE. According to the interhemispheric interaction hypothesis,strongly right-handed people have lower baseline level of interhemispheric interaction and they should benefit more on memory performance from horizontal saccades (Christman，Garvey， Propper，& Phaneuf, 2Oo3)，though some research findings did not fully support this view (Lyle & Jacobs, 201O). Generally speaking, there are inconsistencies in the research results of SIRE, thus it is necessary to conduct a quantitative review of the existing evidence in order to clarify whether the SIRE exists and examine the potential mechanisms.

Two methods were used in previous studies to distinguish the level of interhemispheric interaction. One is to select mixed handed individuals by handedness tests.Since mixed handed individuals have larger corpus callosum (Luders et al.，201O)，their level of interhemispheric interaction should be higher than that of right- or left-handed individuals, and consequently, they have better memory performance.The other method is to provide certain visual stimuli to guide horizontal saccades,the level of interhemispheric interaction can be temporarily improved and subsequent memory retrieval enhanced. It is debatable whether the above two methods can separate individuals with different levels of interhemispheric interaction. However， previous studies have shown that memory was superior in mixed handed individuals than in strongly right-handed individuals (Christman et al.，2006；Christman et al.，2004；Propper， Christman，& Phaneuf，2O05).Moreover， the memory performance of strongly right-handed individuals could be temporarily improved following horizontal saccades. On the contrary, horizontal saccades failed to improve memory performance for non-strongly right-handed individuals,and in some cases even detrimental for their memory performance (Lyle, Logan,& Roediger, 2Oo8).These results provided some support for the interhemispheric interaction hypothesis.

This model suggested that the encoding and retrieval of episodic memory involved asymmetrical brain areas. Specifically， encoding is associated with increased activity in the left prefrontal lobe,while retrieval is associated with increased activity in the right prefrontal lobe (Tulving, Kapur, Craik,Moscovitch,& Houle, 1994). Cabeza and Nyberg (2oOO) summarized PET/fMRl findings and found that the encoding of episodic memory involved the left hemisphere,and the retrieval of episodic memory involved bilateral hemisphere or tended to be right-lateralized.Studies on split-brain individuals also showed that cutting off the connections between the two hemispheres hindered episodic memory recognition (Cronin Golomb, Gabrieli,& Keane,1996). Based on these evidences, Christman and colleagues (2O03) suggested that the interaction between the two hemispheres provides a basis for accurate episodic memory. ",

Propper and colleagues (2O07) compared EEG coherence between left and right frontal lobes between eye movement and control conditions. However， they did not observe any increased interhemispheric EEG coherence following manipulation of horizontal saccades.In Samara's (2011) study, they used a within-group design and compared the changes of EEG coherence before and after saccades.Results showed that although the recognition of emotional words was better following horizontal saccades relative to no eye movements,they failed to observe increased EEG coherence between the two hemispheres follwing horizontal saccades,and the memory enhancement was not correlated to changes of EEG coherence.In a most recent study, the effects of eye movements manipulation on EEG power and coherence were examined (Fleck et al.，2O18).

        "text": "Taken together, although many studies have demonstrated the enhancing effect of saccades on memory retrieval, there is no direct evidence indicating that this efect was contributed by interhemispheric interaction. Lyle and Edlin (2O15) have proposed that saccades may improve memory retrieval by promoting top-down attention control. From this perspective, SIRE can be regarded as the effect of a short attention control \"exercise\". If the subsequent memory test primarily relied on top-down attention control,the effect of this eye movement “exercise\" would be manifested. On the contrary,if the memory test is simple and depends more on bottom-up spontaneous processing, eye movements would not benefit the performance (Lyle & Edlin, 2015).This theory explains why eye movements manipulation can also enhance performance on other cognitive tests such as attention (Edlin & Lyle, 2O13)and creativity (Shobe， Ross，& Fleck, 2O09).The“top-down attention control hypothesis\" was derived from early neuroimaging studies, which suggested that saccades were associated with activations of the frontal eye field,intraparietal sulcus,and superior parietal lobe,namely brain regions that have long been implicated in top-down attention control (Corbetta & Shulman,2Oo2). However, no studies have established a direct relationship between the manipulation of horizontal saccades and activations of attention-related brain regions which lead to enhancement of memory performance.

Similarly, after adjustment $( N = 5 )$ , the effect of unknown handedness individuals decreased from O.6O to 0.31 $( 9 5 \\% C I = [ 0 . 0 3 - 0 . 6 ] )$ but still significant. Detailed results are shown in Table 4. Generally speaking, despite publication bias and the reduced effect sizes after adjustment, our results demonstrated that strongly right-handed individuals could be benefited from horizontal eye movements manipulation， while nonstrongly right-handed individuals were insensitive to this procedure. The overall effect was relatively small ( $\\left. d = 0 . 2 0 \\right.$ maybe due to the inclusion of non-strongly right-handed participants, but the effect remained robust. ",

Effect sizes of SIRE was $d =$ 0.45 for the strongly right-handed group but $d = - 0 . 0 6$ for the non-strongly right-handed group, the latter indicated a null effect.Together with previous evidence, we propose three potential reasons for the inconsistencies in this research field: 1) some studies failed to take handedness into consideration,our results suggested it is a moderating factor of SIRE; 2) there was a large variability of the paradigms and memory types among diferent empirical studies, though the moderating effect of type of memory was not significant, the studies within each type of memory were heterogeneous; 3)the difference in time duration between the end of saccades manipulation and the completion of memory tasks may be another reason for the inconsistent results.Since the enhancing effect of eye movements may be temporary,the benefits may not be maintained if the interval between saccades and recall was too long (Samara et al., 2011). Despite the variabilities,enhancing effect of saccades persists after taking publication bias into consideration, therefore it might be taken as a strategy to improve memory temporarily in daily lives.

        "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, there are mainly two theories on the underlying mechanisms of SIRE. The interhemispheric interaction hypothesis proposed that horizontal saccades improve memory retrieval by facilitating the interhemispheric interaction of the brain (Christman，Garvey， Propper， & Phaneuf, 2O03)，whereas the top-down attentional control hypothesis suggested that eye movements promote memory by improving attention control (Lyle & Edlin，2015). Controversy between these two hypotheses can be partly elucidated by the present meta-analysis. The interhemispheric interaction hypothesis believed the retrieval of episodic memory rely on the level of interhemispheric interaction, and that any facilitation of interhemispheric interaction would improve memory retrieval. According to this theory， strongly right-handed individuals who had lower levels of interhemispheric interaction benefited more from saccades,which was supported by our results.Another important discrepancy between the two theories is whether the direction of saccades affect the effect on memory retrieval.The interhemispheric interaction hypothesis suggests that only horizontal saccades can facilitate interhemispheric interaction，which would be beneficial to memory retrieval. On the contrary, the top-down attentional control hypothesis proposes that the activation offrontoparietal network caused by saccades was the primary reason for memory improvement. According to the latter theory, saccades would improve memory retrieval no matter it is horizontal or vertical. Our results demonstrated that only horizontal saccades are beneficial to memory retrieval，which again supports the interhemispheric interaction hypothesis.Though the three EEG studies (Fleck et al.,2018; Propper，Pierce，Geisler，Christman，& Bellorado，2O07；Samara，Elzinga，Slagter，& Nieuwenhuis, 2O11) did not reveal increased interhemispheric coherence after horizontal saccades manipulation,there were some limitations in these studies, such as small sample size，limited number of electrodes used to measure coherence，and lack of behavioral measures. Further neuroimaging studies with stricter experimental designs were warranted ",
