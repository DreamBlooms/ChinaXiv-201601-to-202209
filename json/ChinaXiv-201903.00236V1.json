Conservation tillage (reduced tilage with residue incorporated (RT) and no-tillage with residue mulch (NT)) significantly increased SOC sequestration and soil aggregation in deep soil compared with conventional tilage with residue removal (CT). Compared with CT,RT significantly increased the proportion of small macroaggregates by $23 \\% { - } 8 1 \\%$ in the $1 0 { - } 8 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ layer, and the OC content in small macroaggregates by $1 \\% - 5 8 \\%$ in the $\\mathrm { 0 - 8 0 ~ c m }$ layer. RT significantly increased (by $2 4 \\% - 9 0 \\%$ the OC content in mineral-SOC within small macroaggregates in the $ { 0 - 6 0 } ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ layer, while there was a $23 \\text{‰}$ $80 \\%$ increase in the $\\ : 0 { - } 4 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ layer with NT. These results indicated that: (1) conservation tillge treatments are beneficial for soil aggregation and SOC sequestration in a deep soil in a dryland environment; and (2) the SOC in mineral-associated OC plays important roles in soil aggregation and SOC sequestration. In conclusion, RT with NT is recommended as an agricultural management tool in dryland soils because of its role in improving soil aggregation and SOC sequestration. ",

It is important to ensure the long-term sustainability of SOC in agro-ecosystems to maintain soil fertility (Liang et al.， 2014). Soil aggregates are linked with SOC stabilization and their formation is considered to be crucial for SOC sequestration (Tisdall and Oades,1982; Balesdent et al., 2000). According to Tisdall and Oades (1982), soil aggregates can be divided into macroaggregates $( > 2 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ and microaggregates $( < 2 5 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ． Cambardella and Elliot (1993） further classified the aggregates as large macroaggregates $( > 2 0 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ， small macroaggregates $( 2 0 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ,microaggregates (250-53 $\\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ,and the silt+clay fraction $( < 5 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ . Soil aggregates can reduce SOC mineralization through physical protection by limiting the contact between organic carbon (OC) and microorganisms (Balabane and Plante, 2004; Sui et al., 2012). The distribution and stability of aggregates are important indicators of the physical quality of a soil (Shrestha et al.,2007; Zhu et al.,2017). However, soil aggregate formation can be modified by agricultural practices, such as tillage and fertilizer application (Ma et al., 2007; Abiven et al.,2009; Wang et al., 2011). ",

The disruption of soil aggregates results in enhanced SOC decomposition and transformation rates (Beare et al.,1994; Zotareli et al., 2007). Some studies have reported that conservation tillage can improve SOC stabilization (Gao et al., 2015; Nath and Lal，2017). Compared with conventional tillage，which can accelerate the regeneration of macroaggregates, conservation tillage can yield a greater macroaggregate content and sequester more SOC in agricultural land (Freibauer et al.,2004; AlvaroFuentes et al., 2008). However, most studies of the effects of tillage and straw retention on soil aggregates have focused on plowing depth $( 0 { - } 2 0 \\mathrm { c m } )$ (Huang et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2015; Liu et al.,2015), while deep soil degradation is becoming a serious limitation to crop yield and soil quality (Hartmann et al.,2Oo8). Accordingly, it is necessary to conduct studies of deep soil (Hou et al.,2013; Andruschkewitsch et al.,2014; Zhu et al., 2017). ",

        "text": "Dryland farming occurs across a large region in the northern China, which accounts for approximately $5 5 \\%$ of all arable land in China. In this region, water shortages and large seasonal and annual variations in rainfallead to regular soil drought and erosion, which are the main limits on crop yield and are aggravated by frequent tillage and residue removal (Wang et al., 2011). Studies have shown that conservation tillage combined with residue retention is an effective measure to enhance soil aggregation and reduce the effects of drought and soil erosion (Wang et al., 2006; Wang et al.,2O11). This study analyzed the soil aggregate distribution and aggregateassociated OC and SOC physical fractions to understand the effect of conservation tilage and residue retention on physical aggregate fractionation in a deep soil in dryland agriculture. The objectives of the study were to ascertain the effects of long-term conservation tillage and residue retention on: (1） aggregate distribution and stability in the vertical direction in soil; and (2) variations in aggregate-associated and subfraction-associated OC in a deep soil in a dryland environment. It was hypothesized that: (1） compared to conventional tillge, conservation tillage would yield more SOC and stable macroaggregates in the deep soil layer in a dryland environment in China; (2） conservation tillage would result in more SOC in soil macroaggregates than conventional tillage; and (3） mineral-associated OC (mSOC） was the main form of SOC accumulated in dryland soils in China.

(1998). Soil subsamples that were classified as $2 0 0 0 { - } 2 5 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ were separated into free-light OC (fLOC), particulate OC (POC), and mSOC.

First， conventional tillge increases soil disturbance， promotes fragmentation of macroaggregates, and reduces the stability of aggregates without organic supplements; thus, accelerating the mineralization of SOC (Six et al., 2002; Hou et al., 2013; Andruschkewitsch et al.,2014). Second, conservation tilage involves returning the residue back to the field， which can directly increase the SOC content,accelerate the formation of macroaggregates, and reinforce their stability (Six et al., 2O04; Blanco-canqui and Lal, 2007; Gao et al.,2015;Liu et al., 2015; Jiang et al.,2017). The soil under conservation tillage was less disturbed than under CT and therefore conservation tillage created a suitable environment for microorganism activity and diversity with regard to the soil pore-size distribution, temperature and water capacity (Young et al., 200o; Six et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2017).

Soil aggregate formation is affected by many factors,of which tillage practice and residue retention are among the most vital.This study demonstrated that conservation tillage and residue retention significantly increased the amount of macroaggregates in the surface layer $( 0 { - } 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } )$ ，which was consistent with the results of many previous studies (Golchin et al.,1994; Bossuyt et al.,2002; Andruschkewitsch et al.,2014; Liu et al.,2015).The main reason for the significant difference in macroaggregate mass proportion between conventional and conservation tilage is that moldboard plowing has a negative effect on macroaggregate maintenance. Conservation tillage treatments with crop residue addition provide energy for biological activity in soil; thus,aiding macroaggregate formation (Lal,1995; Liu et al., 2015). Furthermore,this study showed that the distribution of soil aggregates had a close relationship with SOC,i.e., the mass percentage of macroaggregates increased with SOC content (Fig. 3). This was in line with the results of Jiang et al. (2O17), who reported that organic matter played a critical role in soil aggregate formation. The main reason for this phenomenon was the ability of SOC to function as a binding agent. On the one hand, SOC provides nutrients and energy for microorganisms and crops,thereby resulting in more excretion, which produces binding agents for aggregates. On the other hand, SOC directly encouraged aggregation by binding soil mineral particles that could then form soil aggregates. ",

        "text": "Aregular phenomenon related to soil aggregate distribution, which has rarely been reported, was detected in the deeper soil layers (down to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { c m } \\dot { } ,$ )in this study (Ma et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2013; Andruschkewitsch et al.,2014).The results revealed that in the 20-40,40-60, 60-80,and 80-100 cm layers, conservation tillage still increased the mass percentage of small macroaggregates compared to CT. These results confirmed the first hypothesis proposed in this study,i.e.， that conservation tilage could develop more stable macroaggregates in deep soil layers in dryland China.The root distribution, tillage method,and soil structure, especially the pore-size distribution and interconnection, need to be considered to describe this phenomenon. Mengel and Barber(1974) determined that the top $7 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ of soil is physically suitable for root growth, but that the maize root system has the genetic potential to develop and extend deeper than $1 0 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ (Hartmann et al.,2008). The deepest layer where conservation tillage affected the aggregate distribution in the current study was precisely in line with these previous studies (Fig. 2). The root system on one hand can change the soil structure, but on the other hand can produce residues and exudates that are critical bonding materials for soil aggregation and provide an energy source for soil microorganisms (Six et al., 2000a; Zheng et al.,2015; Li et al.,2016). Moreover, conservation tillage has beneficial impacts on hydrologic properties, the water infiltration rate, and soil structure (Nath and Lal, 2Ol7), which promotes plant growth and produces more roots than conventional tillge. CT involved two plowings, RT had one plowing, and NT had none. Reduced tillge enhances aggregate stability and produces less compaction, which benefits nutrient exchange between soil levels (Hou et al., 2013). For this reason， RT and NT both showed significant increases in the amount of small macroaggregates compared with CT. Another important factor is the soil pore structure. As reported by Gao et al. (2Ol7), there are many more connected pores in a conservation tillage soil than in a conventional tillage soil, which are crucial for maintaining oxygen content and water movement. The connections between pores in soil enable the delivery of organic nutrition from the upper layer to the deep soil, accelerating aggregate formation. Aggregate formation models assume an approximate formation rate of macroaggregates under NT and CT because the input of residues is practically identical in these two tillage treatments (Six et al., 200ob; Zotareli L et al.,2007). Similarly, in the present study, similar formation rates of macroaggregate were assumed under NT, RT and CT.In models,the ratio of fPOC to cPOC can be used as a relative measurement of macroaggregate turnover. A high ratio of fPOC to cPOC means a slow turnover of macroaggregates (Six et al., 200ob; Zotarelli L et al.,2007). In this study, it was found that the ratios of fPOC to cPOC in small macroaggregates under RT and NT were higher than under CT in all layers. The ratio was almost twice as large as in CT(Table 2) (except for RT in the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ layer and RT and NT in the $4 0 { \\mathrm { - } } 6 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ layer)，meaning that the macroaggregate turnover in RT and NT was approximately twice as slow as in CT.

In small macroaggregates, the highest OC content was observed under the RT treatment and was significantly increased from the $0 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 0 ~ { \\mathrm { c m } }$ to the 60-80 cm layers compared with that under CT. Due to the application of straw in the field,aggregate formation under RTcan be more efficient and stable than under CT(Table 2).Fresh organic material could be successfully occluded within small macroaggregates (Oortset al.， 2007; Andruschkewitsch et al.，2013）and reduced tillage times,resulted in less disruption of small macroaggregates and a good pore structure under RT and leading to greater OC accumulation (Andruschkewitsch et al.,2014; Gao et al.,2015; Gao et al.,2017). NT significantly increased the OC content in large macroaggregates $( > 2 0 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ in the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layer,and the large macroaggregates were more stable compared with CT,as demonstrated by the higher MWD and GWD (Table 2). These results were in line with the second hypothesis proposed here, i.e., that conservation tillage would result in more SOC being present in macroaggregates. However, NT resulted in the lowest OC content in small macroaggregates for all soil layers except the $0 { - } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ layer. Although straw was left in the NT field, the straw was unbroken, with no tillage treatment, which could have led to less residue decomposition and more transportation between soil layers (Six et al.,2000a; Ayoubi et al.,2012). This could have led to OC accumulation in the surface layer under NT. ",

RT significantly increased the OC content in small macroaggregates at depths of $0 { - } 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ compared with CT.In addition to the reduced tillage times under RT,chopping the straw that was mixed into the soil also explained this result. Crop residues directly increased the SOC in aggregates and created a good soil structure for nutrition leaching.In addition, they also played a critical role in binding particles together and offering energy and nutrients for microorganisms,which in turn produced excreta to serve as nucleation sites for aggregates (Andruschkewitsch et al.,2014; Wang et al., 2017). Furthermore, the environmental conditions in this dryland agricultural region should be taken into consideration. Low mean precipitation and high evaporation affect the decomposition rate of exogenous material. These factors led to decomposed organic materials being accumulated in microaggregates and rarely in the silt+clay fraction. In contrast, most OC accumulated in macroaggregates (Zhao et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2017). ",

The results presented here show that the $< 5 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ fraction in small macroaggregates was highest under RT and was higher under RT and NT than under CT (Fig. 6a). Moreover, RT and NT significantly increased the OC content in fPOC and mSOC down to a depth of $6 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ (Fig. 6b). These results are consistent with the theory presented above and with the third hypothesis presented here, that $\\mathrm { \\ m S O C }$ is the main way to accumulate SOC in dryland soil. These results were in line with those of Li et al. (2Ol6), who conducted an incubation experiment by adding $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ -labeled maize straw residue to carborundum tubes containing soil and found that the OC content derived from residual carbon increased with incubation time and was mainly distributed in the mSOC fraction.

        "text": "Long-term conservation tillage with residue retention increased SOC contents in deep soil. A significant effect of RT was sustained down to the $6 0 { - } 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ layer, while that of NT was sustained down to the $4 0 { - } 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ layer. This implies that conservation tillage can increase the SOC content in deep soil compared with CT. The RT treatment significantly increased the amount of small macroaggregates in the layers from 10 to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ ,and the number of small macroaggregates in the $0 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 \\ { \\mathrm { c m } }$ layers under NT was higher than under CT. In addition, the MWD and GMD under conservation tillage were higher than under CT at a soil depth of $\\scriptstyle 0 - 8 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ ,which suggested a more stable aggregation with conservation tilage, not only in surface soil, but also in deep soil. RT significantly increased aggregate-associated OC contents in small macroaggregates at a depth of $\\scriptstyle 0 - 8 0 \\ { \\mathrm { c m } }$ compared with CT. The proportion of the $< 5 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ fraction in small macroaggregates and the OC content in fPOC and mSOC were significantly higher under both RT and NT down to a depth of $6 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ . In conclusion, conservation tillage with residue retention improved soil quality by accelerating soil aggregation and SOC sequestration. This agricultural management practice is recommended in dryland soil because of its role in improving soil aggregation and SOC sequestration, which will significantly increase or maintain the maize yield (Fig. 7).
