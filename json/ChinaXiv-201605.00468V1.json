We further conducted rice whole-genome GeneChip analysis to elucidate the possible molecular mechanism underlying why the down-regulation of $0 s S P X 1$ caused deficiencies in anthers and pollens and lower seed-setting rate in rice.The down-regulation of $\\boldsymbol { O s S P X 1 }$ significantlyaffected expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and sugar transport,anther development,cell cycle,etc.These genes may be related to polen fertilityand male gametophyte development. Our study demonstrated that down-regulation of $0 s S P X 1$ disrupted rice normal antherand pollen development by affecting carbohydrate metabolism and sugar transport, leading to semi-male sterility,and ultimately resulted in low seed-seting rate and qrain yield.

        "text": "Rice (Oryza sativa),one of the major food staples for the world's population，isa model monocot plant for molecular biological studyand a model crop for agronomical improvement.The rice grain yield is affected by many genetic and environmental factors, such as photosynthesis ability，nutrient efficiency，processes of pollination and fertilization,biotic and abiotic stresses,etc.Pollen fertility isa critical factor for rice yield.Dozens of genes are involved in anther and pollen development in rice and Arabidopsis，including anther cell differentiation，meiosis and pollen development (Wilson and Zhang，2oo9)．The development of pollen and anther requires nutrients such as sugars and lipids from source organs to support pollen development and maturation (Goetz et al.,2001). Carbon Starved Anther (CSA),encoding a MYB transcription factor,is involved in sugar partitioning and the csa mutant showed low carbohydrate level in later anthers with male sterility (Zhang et al.，201O).Defective Pollen Wall (DPW)isa fatty acyl reductase，and the mutant dpw showed defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine (Shi et al.,2O11).The tapetum degeneration triggered by a programmed cell death (PCD） process provides cellular contents supporting pollen wall formation (Wu and Cheun,2ooO).The TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) encodes a putative transcription factor with a bHLH domain.In the tdr mutant,the tapetum PCD was retarded in the anther with aborted pollen development (Li etal.，2oo6).The Arabidopsis ortholog AMS (Aborted Microspores) showed similar function (Xu et al.，2010). UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) is a key enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism,producing UDP-glucose for sucrose synthesis in leaves.In Arabidopsis pho1 mutants，Ugp was found to be up-regulated under conditions of phosphate deficiency (Ciereszko et al.，2o01).Rice Ugp1 is essential for pollen callose deposition，and the Ugp1-silenced plants showed thermosensitive male sterility (Chen etal.,20o7).Rice OsUgp2 is apollen-preferential gene and plays a critical role in starch accumulation during pollen maturation (Mu et al.,2009).

Rice plants can accumulate abundant Pi in vegetative organs such as leaves at the early developmental stage and transport the Pi stored in the leaves to reproductive organs such as panicle at the late developmental stage (Marschner，1995).The rice phosphate transporter gene $\\boldsymbol { O s P T 8 }$ is involved in Pi translocation from vegetative organs to reproductive organs in rice.The suppression of OsPT8 resulted in lower seed-setting rate,higher phosphorus content in the panicle axis and decreased phosphorus content in unfilled grain hulls (Jia et al.，2011).Under high Pi level，overexpressing OsPHR2 upregulated some Pi transporter genes and suppressed the growth parameters during harvest stage,for example lower seed-setting rate,lower tiller number and grain number.In particular，the OsPHR2-Ov1 transgenic line showed disordered male reproductive organs such as twisted anther structures,few pollen grains and low pollen viability (Zhou et al.，2008).The Itn1 (OsPHO2) mutant significantly reduced tiller numberand fertility compare to WT (Hu et al.，2011)．OsSPX1，as one of the Pi-dependent inhibitors of OsPHR2 activity in rice (Wang et al.，2014)，is involved in the Pi starvation signaling network related to OsPHR2 and OsPHO2 (Liu et al.,201O),but there is no any report about the effect of $\\boldsymbol { O s S P X 1 }$ on pollen development and grain yield.

        "text": "Phosphorus is one of the major mineral nutrients for plant growth and development.Rice plants can accumulate abundant Pi in vegetative organs such as leaves at the early developmental stage and transport the Pi stored in the leaves to reproductive organs such as panicle at the late developmental stage.OsSPX1is involved in the Pi-signaling network related to OsPHR2 and OsPHO2.OsPHR2-Ov1 transgenic line showed disordered male reproductive organs.The Itn1 (OsPHO2) mutant had significantly reduced tiller number and fertility compared to WT.We studied the potential function of OsSPX1 during rice reproductive phase, and discovered that the $0 s S P X 1$ antisense transgenic rice lines had lower seed-setting rate.Thus,we further investigated the anther and pollen development of the transgenic and wild-type plants and found that the pollen fertility was affected by antisense of $ { \\boldsymbol { O } }  { \\boldsymbol { s } }  { \\boldsymbol { S } }  { \\boldsymbol { P } }  { \\boldsymbol { X } }  { \\boldsymbol { 1 } }$ gene，possibly through influence on pollen fertility.We conducted rice whole-genome GeneChip analysis to comparethe gene expressionprofiling between wild-type and transgenic rice lines.GO and GeneBins analysis results showed that the down-regulated genes in the $ { \\mathcal Ḋ O s Ḍ } ^ { \\phantom { \\dagger } }$ antisense lineswere significantly enriched in the following biological processes,including starch and sucrose metabolism，carbohy drate metabolism and sugar transport,anther development,cell cycle,etc. ",

        "text": "During the pollen maturation，starch and lipids accumulate and the supply of photosynthetic assimilates (including sugar and lipids) from source organs is required (Goetz et al.，2001). In the functional enrichment analysis for the probe sets that had significantly lower expression in Ubi::OsSPX1-antisense transgenic lineA1，GeneBins，MapMan and GO analysesall highlighted the sucrose and starch metabolism and sugar transporter categories.Starch biosynthesis is critical during pollen maturation and sterile pollen are normally starch deficient (Datta et al.,2oo2).In maize,several key sugar metabolic genes were lower expressed in late pollen stage of CMS male-sterile genotype than that of male-fertile genotypes,including SPP (sucrose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase)，IVR (invertase)，HXK (Hexokinase),hexose transporter,etc.(Datta et al.,2oo2).In our results， two HXK genes(LOC_Os05g09500 and LOC_ Os05g3111） and one SPP homolog (LOC_Os05g05270)were significantly lower expressed in Ubi:OsSPX1-antisense transgenic line A1 (Table 1).Moreover,a dozen of sugar transporter genes Werealso lower expressed in this line (Table 1).Expression patterns of seven sugar transporter genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 5).For example,LOC_Os10g21590,a carbohydrate transporter/sugar porter gene has its Arabidopsis homologs，AtPMT1 and AtPMT2 more highly expressed in mature or germinating pollen grains，aswell as in growing pollen tubes (Klepek et al.，201O)．Analyses of reporter genes performed with promoter sequences showed expressionin hydathodes and young xylem cells (both genes)．For another gene of a sugar transport protein,LOC_Os07g10590 - of,its Arabidopsis homologs，AtSTP6 was only expressed during the late stages of pollen (Scholz-Starke et al.,20o3)and AtSTP9 was specifically expressed in the male gametophyte (Schneidereit et al.，2003). In addition，several ABCG (ATP-binding cassette transporter) genes were lower expressed in line A1 (Table 1), including $L O C \\_ O s 1 O g 1 3 8 3 0 ,$ homolog of Arabidopsis ABCG31. It was reported that the many pollen grains in double mutant abcg9/abcg31 were shrivelled up and collapsed when exposure todryair (Schneidereit et al.，2oo3).These results indicate that antisense of $0 s S P X 1$ ，possibly through regulation of phosphate homoeostasis,affects the expression levels of some key genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and sugar transport，and then influences the transport of nutrients from source organs like flag leaves to sink organs like anthers.
