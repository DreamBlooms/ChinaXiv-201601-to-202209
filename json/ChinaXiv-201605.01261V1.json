Here we have developed a new lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) for B. anthracis spore detection based on the fact that conjugates of B.anthracis spores and super-paramagnetic particles labeled with antibodies willblock the pores of chromatographic strips and form retention lines on the strips,instead of the conventionally reported test lines and control lines in classic LFIA.As aresult, this new LFIA can simultaneously realize optical, magnetic and naked-eye detection by analyzing signals from the retention lines.As few as 5Oo-7Oo pure B.anthracis spores can be recognized with CV values less than $8 . 3 1 \\%$ within $5 \\mathrm { m i n }$ of chromatography and a total time of $2 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ .For powdery sample tests, this LFIA can endure interference from $2 5 \\%$ （20 $( \\boldsymbol { \\mathsf { w } } / \\boldsymbol { \\mathsf { v } } )$ milk, $10 \\%$ (w/v）baking soda and $1 0 \\%$ (w/v）starch without any sample pre-treatment,and has a corresponding detection limit of $6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ spores/g milk powder, $2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ spores/g starch and $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ spores $/ \\mathrm { g }$ baking soda.

        "text": "Lateral-flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIA）are considered as simple and small devices for the detection of targets in samples.Since serological lateral-flow tests emerged in the 1980s, this technology has been widely applied in medical diagnostics (Arens et al.，2005；McMullan et al.,2012),biodefense (Hodge et al.,2013;Hong et al.,2010), food safety(Shephard,2008)and other fields due to its fast-response,low cost and simplicity (Paek et al.,20oO;Yetisen et al.,2013). This technology integrates thin layerchromatography with immunoreactions.The capture protein (antibody orantigen),usually labeled by colloidal gold,binds to its target and flows alonga chromatography strip by capillary force. When chromatography is finished,protein-target complexes and free capture proteins accumulate in two defined regions of the strip，forming a test line and control line,respectively.The qualitative or quantitative detection of various analytes can be assessed by the naked eye or with the aid of portable devices. Recently,many new labels,such as quantum dots (Berlina et al, 2013;Li et al., 2010),magnetic particles (Afshar et al., 2011; Liu et al.,2O11), carbon nanoparticles (Suarez-Pantaleon et al., 2013) and fluorescent bioconjugates (Swanson and D'Andrea, 2013; Zhang et al.，2O14)，have been used in LIFA,giving improved detection sensitivity.However,LIFAs are mainly used to detect proteins,drugs and other small molecules,and often suffer from interference from particle components in the tested samples.

        "text": "Bacillus anthracis,a Gram-positive aerobic bacterium,is notoriousas the causative agent of anthrax and is a“Category A\" biothreat.In addition to conventional bacteriological assays,various techniques are capable of identifying B.anthracis,including immunoassays (Morel et al.,2O12)，DNA sequencing (Be et al, 2013), biosensor detection systems (Hao et al., 2Oo9;Wang et al., 2009a),Raman microspectroscopy (Arora et al.,2O12),Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry(Li et al.,2O12）and other advanced approaches based on nanomaterials (Deng et al.，2013). These methods tend to have long detection time,require the use of expensive devices,complicated protocols or experienced operators.As a result,the detection of B.anthracis spores under field conditions is still challenging.To address this issue,we previously developed specific and high affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which can bind directly to the surface of intact B.anthracis (Wang etal.,2oo9b). Using the mAbs and super-paramagnetic iron oxide particles as labels,we established a super-paramagnetic lateralflow immunological detection system for the detection of pure B.anthracis spores and B.anthracis spore-containing artificial samples (Wang et al.,2013).This system provided good stability, longtermstorageand asensitivedetectionlimitof $4 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ 、However,the chromatography step requires almost $3 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ and low concentrations of B.anthracis spores cannot be detected with the naked eye.This is likely because both the super-paramagnetic particles (diameter: $1 0 0 { - } 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ )andtheB. anthracis sporesare large in size (diameter: $\\sim 1 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\dot { }$ and forma huge immunocomplex which causes“Road Closure\"during chromatography,especially when more than one epitope on the spore surface is bound by antibody.This hypothesis would explain why in our previous report we always found complex resting near the conjugate pad of strips during the chromatographic process.The bulkiness of spores and their ease of aggregation thus limit the application of LIFA for the detection of intact spores.

These results indicate that significant amounts of Bacillus spores other than B.anthracis spores were not captured by mAbs conjugated super-paramagnetic particles.Therefore,this proposed \"Road Closure\"based magnetic lateral-flow immunoassay is specific for detection of B.anthracis spores.

        "text": "It is often necessary to analyze white powders for biothreat hazards and environmental safety issues.In this study,as the common household products,milk powder, starch and baking soda were chosen as representatives white powders.After mixing spores with these powders,samples were dissolved or resuspended in reaction buffer, then analyzed directly without the need for any pre-treatment such as filtration.No obvious interference from milk powder ( $1 5 \\%$ $20 \\%$ and $2 5 \\% , \\mathrm { w / v } )$ orstarch $( 5 \\% , 1 0 \\% , \\mathrm { w / v } )$ was detected.As shown in Fig.5,B.anthracis spores could still be recognized at concentrations as low as $1 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ with a CV less than $9 \\%$ in the $2 5 \\%$ milk sample (Fig.5A). Similar results were obtained for the $10 \\%$ starch sample (Fig.5B), giving corresponding detection limits of $6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ spores $/ { \\tt g }$ in milk powder and $2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ spores $/ { \\tt g }$ in starch.Bearing in mind that both milk samples over $2 5 \\%$ and starch samples over $10 \\%$ are difficult to prepare because of theirrespective solubilities,higher concentration gradients were not designed for this test.Compared with the milk and starch samples,baking soda had a marked effect on spore detection. In the $10 \\%$ baking soda saturated solution,the detection limit was approximately $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ (Fig.5C),about 10-fold higher than that obtained for detection of pure B. anthracis spores (Fig. 2C). Evenwhen the concentration of baking soda was $5 \\%$ ,thedetection limit of the magnetic assay reader only reached $4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ (data not shown).It is possible that the ion content in baking soda influences immunological reactions between B.anthracis spores and mAbs conjugated super-paramagnetic particles,reducing detection sensitivity.However,baking soda also gave a satisfactory CVvalue of $5 . 3 2 \\substack { - 8 . 6 9 \\% }$ ，andhad a similar linearrange $( 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 3 } { - } 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \\mathrm { C F U / m l } )$ to the two other white powdery samples (Fig.5).To our knowledge,no lateral-flow based techniques for spore detection that directly analyze such high levels of powdery samples without any pre-treatment have been reported.Although PCR provides similar levels of sensitivity when testing $2 \\%$ starch samplesand milk samples,it fails to detect B.anthracis sporesin baking soda solution at this concentration (Isabel et al.,2012). These tests thus demonstrate that our lateral-flow immunoassay is notaffected by interference and performs excellently even when there is a high content of powdery matrix. ",

        "text": "This study provides a new immunochromatographic assay strategy for the sensitiveand rapid detection of intactB.anthracis spores in complex matrices.It has several significant advantages over traditional lateral-flow immunoassays.Firstly,with respect to strip manufacture,conjugate pads previously located between the sample pad and nitrocellulose membrane have been removed,as theyare not needed as carriers of labeled antigen or antibody.In addition,antibody is not preloaded onto the nitrocellulose membrane to form test lines and control lines during the chromatography process.This new design not only simplifies the production process,but also eliminates the need for special storage conditions associated with preloaded antibodies.This new method thus greatly reduces manufacturing costs and also extends the shelf life of the strips.Secondly,the super-paramagnetic particles play a dual role.As reported previously (Wang et al.，2013)，superparamagnetic particlesare still used as antibody labels to facilitate quantification,as they produce stable magnetic signals with low background noise due to their unique physicochemical properties. At the same time,these particles also serve to purify/enrich B.anthracis spores.During incubation,the B.anthracis spores in the sample are captured by the mAbs conjugated super-paramagnetic particles forming immunocomplexes (Fig.S).After washing and magnetic separation,these complexes can be separated from the reaction system and resuspended in a suitable volume of an appropriate buffer. Therefore,irrespective of the components of the tested sample,this method can be used directly to detect B. anthracis spores providing there is an immunological reaction. In reality,antigen-antibody interactions are usually robust and can endure greater interference than techniques such as PCR(Fig.5). In addition,conventional lateral-flow assays generally require sample pre-treatment before B.anthracis spores can be detected in powdery matrices because of their low tolerance of interference. Thirdly,and most importantly,our new lateral-flow immunoassay performs excellently for B.anthracis spore detection.As it employs super-paramagnetic particles as labels and does not require any sample pre-treatment,it can simultaneously provide optical, magnetic and naked-eye detection within a total time of $2 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ 业 Low concentrations of B.anthracis spores can be clearly distinguished by the naked eye and can also be quantified with an optical signal detector or magnetic analyzer (Fig.3). For spore cultures,it has a detection limit of $5 { - } 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ in $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { l }$ spore suspensions (Figs.2 and 3),indicating that as few as 500- $7 0 0 B .$ anthracis spores can be recognized.This is not only far below the estimated $5 0 \\%$ lethal dose $( \\mathrm { L D } _ { 5 0 } )$ for humans of 3000- 50,000 spores (Eubanks et al.,2oO7),but isalso more sensitive than many other immunological detection methods which are combined with advanced instrumentation(Li et al.,2O12;Wang et al.,2oo9a). Similar results can be achieved for low concentrations of powdery substances including $5- 1 5 \\%$ milk and $5 \\%$ starch (data not shown).While the sensitivity was slightly reduced when analyzing $2 5 \\%$ milk and $10 \\%$ starch,it can still provide specific recognition of $1 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } – 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\mathrm { C F U } / \\mathrm { m l } \\ B$ . anthracis spores, giving a corresponding detection limit of $6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ spores $/ \\mathrm { g }$ milk powder and $2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ spores/g starch (Fig.5). This is better than previouslyreported lateral-flow assays and expensive chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (Chenau et al., 2011;Wang et al. 2013). However,saturated baking soda did markedly interfere with the detection process,giving a detection limit of $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\mathrm { C F U / m l }$ and $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ spores/g. We believe this will not interfere with the application of this assay for the detection of B.anthracis spores inanti-terroristactivities,as terrorists are more inclined to spread highlyconcentratedB.anthracis spores.Asan example,B.anthracis spore preparations which were mailed through the U.S.Postal Service in 2O01,had a concentration of $4 . 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } \\mathrm { C F U / g }$ and $2 . 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } \\mathrm { C F U / g }$ (http://www.justice.gov.). Our “Road Closure\" based super-paramagnetic lateral-flow immunoassay thus has manyadvantages for B.anthracis spore detection. ",
