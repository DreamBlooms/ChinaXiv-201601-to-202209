Three signal processing algorithms are investigated, including the correlation method, which isused to make an initial estimate of the incidence angle withina certainrange.Then inverse matrix method and singular value decomposition method are subsequently utilized to refine the estimate within this range.

        "text": "DOA estimation techniques for aperture antenna have wide applications in many fields,such as communication,radar, sonar,radio,etc [1].Many algorithms,including the Multiple SignalClassification(MUSIC)Ôºå EstimationofSignal Parameters via Rotation Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT), have been investigated to address this problem.However,these techniques do not perform too well on highly correlated or coherent signals generated via multipath propagation scenario. Alternative approaches for coherent signals have also been developed for DOA estimationÔºå including the Maximum Likelihood (MLÔºâ method,Weighted Subspace Fiting(WSF) methodÔºåSpatial Smoothing(SSÔºâ methodÔºåSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) method and Toeplitz method, to name a few.Its accuracy of the ML method degrades severely when the angular separation between sources is small and the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) drops below a certain level [2].The WSF method presents a relatively high computational burden owing to the multi-variable minimization that it must perform.The SS method cannot resolve the number of signals that exceed the number of array sensors.The performance of SVD method is poor when the SNR level is low,because it reconstructs the matrix data set,which includes all the signal information,by directly processing the noise-free snapshot data[3]. In this paper,a novel technique for DOA estimation is proposed for aperture antennas,such as the parabolic reflector to improve the estimation in a computationally efficient manner. The proposed method uses the correlation approach to estimate the DOA within a certain angular range.The inverse matrix and SVD methods are subsequently employed to improve the initial estimate and improve the resolution of the aperture antenna.
