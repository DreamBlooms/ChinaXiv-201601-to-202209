        "text": "Biomass production on low-grade land is needed to meet future energy demands and minimize resource conflicts.This,however,requires improvements in plant water-use eficiency(WUE)that are beyond conventional C3 and C4 dedicated bioenergy crops.Here we present the first global-scale geographic information system (GIS)-based productivity model of two highly water-efcient crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) candidates: Agaoe tequilana and Opuntia ficus-indica.Features of these plants thattranslateto WUE advantages over C3 and C4bioenergy crops include nocturnal stomatal opening，rapid rectifier-like root hydraulic conductivity responses to fluctuating soil water potential and the capacity to buffer against periods of drought.Yield simulations for the year 2070 were performed under the four representative concentration pathway (RCPs) scenarios presented in the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report. Simulations on low-grade land suggest that O.ficus-indica alone has the capacity to meet 'extreme' bioenergy demand scenarios $( > 6 0 0$ EJ $\\mathrm { y r } ^ { - 1 }$ ）and is highlyresilient to climate change $( - 1 \\% )$ .Agave tequilana is moderately impacted $( - 1 1 \\% )$ . These results are significant because bioenergy demand scenarios ${ > } 6 0 0$ EJ $\\mathrm { y r } ^ { - 1 }$ could be met without significantly increasing conflicts with food production and contributing to deforestation. Both CAM candidates outperformed the C4 bioenergy crop,Panicum virgatum L.

        "text": "Strategies to improve energy security and mitigate against the impacts of climate change commonly include the production of energy from biomass (EIA, 2013; IEA,2013). On a calorific basis,the most important biomass resources in future energy scenarios are feedstocks specifically grown for energy (Slade et al.,2014). However, the utilization of land for dedicated energy crops is controversial.Conflicts that exist between land allocated to bioenergy production, food production,and biodiversity conservation have been called the 'bioenergy trilemma'(Tilman et al.，20o9).These conflicts are predicted to become more acute with the negative impacts of climate change on water availability and food production, set against the increasing demands of agrowing global population (Tilman et al.，2oo9;Godfray et al.,2010;Van Renssen,2011;Creutzig et al.,2012; Howellsetal.,2013;Wheeler&von Braun,2013;Slade et al., 2014). One possible solution is to restrict bioenergy production to marginal and low-grade lands.Yet the extent to which such areas may be utilized remains largely unknown and would require improvements in plant water-use efficiency (WUE) that exclude most conventional C3 and C4 bioenergy crops (Somerville et al., 2010; Slade et al., 2014). In this context,we present the first global-scale geospatial productivity model for two bioenergy candidates of the highly water-use efficient crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) pathway.We also provide an assessment of the resilience of these candidates to climate change and investigate productivity potential on low-grade lands，which we define using Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) land-use classifications (FAO et al. 2012).

The primary uptake of $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ at night，when temperatures are low, reduces evaporative demand across the open stomata and is a key WUE adaptation of the CAM pathway (Osmond,1978;Smith &Nobel,1986;Nobel,1988;Winter & Smith, 1996). Water storage parenchyma tissue of succulent CAM species provides a buffer against periods ofwaterdeficit stress,and rectifier-like roothydraulic conductivity responses minimize retrograde plantsoil water losses and allow plants to capitalize on short periods of water availability (Barcikowski & Nobel, 1984;Smith & Nobel,1986;Nobel,1988).

        "text": "Succulent CAM tissues allow plants to maintain water homeostasis and facilitate a carbon acquisition strategy of‘drought avoidance' (Borland et al.,2011,2014). This is distinct from ‘drought tolerance'，which is typically observed in arid and semi-arid C3 and C4 plants that show the capacity to endure low cell water potential or inextreme cases，desiccation (Ogburn & Edwards, 2010). Integrated over a $2 4 \\mathrm { - h }$ period，typical WUE (defined as the ratio of mmol $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ fixed to mol $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ lost）values are $0 . 5 – 1 . 5$ for C3 plants,1.0-2.0 for C4 plants,and 4.0-10 for plants displaying CAM (Nobel, 1991).Under ideal conditions,some species of Agave and Opuntia average $4 3 ~ \\mathrm { M g } ~ \\mathrm { h a } ^ { - 1 } ~ \\mathrm { y r } ^ { - 1 }$ above-ground dry mass productivity which is comparable to agronomic C4 species and C3 herbaceous species and trees (Nobel,1991). These features have lead researchers to propose that CAM plantations could be more resilient to climate change and offer higher productivity on lowgrade and marginal lands than conventional C3 and C4 biomass crops (Borland et al.，2009，2014;Davis et al., 2011).We tested these hypotheses by (i) constructing a global-scale geospatial productivity model for the CAM biomass candidates Agave tequilana and Opuntia ficusindica，(ii) simulating productivity under present-day and future climate scenarios using outputs from representative concentration pathway (RCP） scenarios presented in the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report (AR5), (iii) applying macro-scale land-use constraints to estimate productivity potential on 'low-grade' lands,and (iv) comparing present-day simulations to outputs of a recently published model for the C4 biomass candidate, Panicum virgatum L.
