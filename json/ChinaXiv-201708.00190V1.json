Other postmortem processes,such as weathering, trampling,and transportation all modify bones and contribute to the forming assemblage.Here we examined three Miocene localities from Damiao,Nei Mongol, China with different fluvial subenvironments.The ages span from early Miocene to early late Miocene (ca.21-11.6 Ma).We describe the sedimentary context and taphonomic features of the small mammal assemblages, and identify the responsible agents for the fossil accumulations.Our study reveals predation as primary means of accumulation for all three localities.However,there is overprinting of other means of accumulation such as fluvial transportation and possibly signs of trampling at the two younger localities.Results indicate possibly different predators for all localities;owls for the oldest one,and diurnal birds of prey or mammalian agents for the younger two.We also show that systematic excavation for small mammals can be done,and in this way it may be possible to reduce some of the damage collecting always produces.

Of different predators, mammals modify the bones of their prey the most due to the usage of their shearing teeth in breaking up the prey before ingestion and due to this damage prey of mammalian predators is less likely to become fossilized (Andrews and Evans,1983).The least amount of bone breakage is produced by owls,while diurnal birds of prey are intermediate bone breakers (Andrews and Evans,1983;Andrews,1990).

(Andrews,1990; Arcos et al., 2010; Williams, 2001). Weathering occurs when bones are lying in the open without protection of some kind (Andrews,1990; Behrensmeyer, 1978).

Although numerous, the Neogene fossil mammal localities in Central Nei Mongol are scattered,lacking continuous vertical exposures and there are few representatives of early Miocene mammals (Kaakinen et al.,2015;Wang et al., 2009).In Damiao the strata constitute one of the most continuous sequences in Nei Mongol with early, middle,and late Miocene fossil faunas in stratigraphic superposition. Damiao also hosts the latest occurrence of the humid favouring pliopithecid primate in Central Asia,in the late middle Miocene locality of DMo1 (Zhang and Harrison, 2008). Out of the circa 30 localities,three rich localities of different age and sedimentology were chosen for closer inspection. The stratigraphy (Kaakinen et al., 2015) and some mammalian groups have been studied in detail (Wang and Zhang, 2O11; Zhang et al., 2011).

Both teeth and bones from DM16 showed high incidence of breakage, intrusive corrosion, rounding, polishing, cracking, enamel piting and staining (Fig. 3), the taphonomic features that indicate predation (e.g., Andrews,1990; Andrews and Evans,1983; Fernandez-Jalvo, 1995;Reed and Denys,2011). The straight and spiral fracture types in broken bone specimens provide further evidence for predation (Shipman et al.,1981) as means of accumulation. Results from DM16 were also inspected with respect to the richest fossil layer. This level showed even more specimens with features associated with digestion (breakage, intrusive corrosion,and scrapes) than layers below or above it. Cracking was detected only from specimens from the richest fossil horizon and below it,and was more common in teeth than bones.Nevertheless,this feature was less common than other predation features and could result from other taphonomic agents than predation, for example from weathering during subaereal exposure of the remains. Weathering,in turn,is more common on bones than teeth but is altogether not a very common feature and can be separated from digestion by some unique features on the surface of the specimens.Weathering in small mammal remains can be identified from splitting that occurs along the collagen fiber orientation,flaking or exfoliation of the outer layer of bone (Fig. 4C) as well chipping and spliting of teeth (Andrews,1990).

However, the bimodal breakage distribution at DMO1 could indicate two different agents forcing the accumulation. Primary means of accumulation would be predation with overprinting of other processes like transportation or trampling. It is said that much of the breakage of bone assemblages is due to transport before or after burial and transportation of small mammal bones produces high levels of breakage (Andrews,199o). Trampling on the other hand is not well documented in small mammals since their bones are easily destroyed (Andrews,1990).

Owls are commonly cited as a source for accumulations of small vertebrate fossils (Andrews,1990; Andrews and Evans,1983;Dodson and Wexlar,1979), but there is rich evidence of various other predators like diurnal raptors and mammalian carnivores involved in the accumulation of small mammal vertebrate remains as well (Andrews and Evans,1983 and references therein). Predation seems to be a likely agent of accumulation for all localities in Damiao, however, there are differences in the intensities of digestion-associated features between localities (Fig. 3), which might point to different predator species as dominant accumulation agents. Mammalian carnivores have a complete digestion and high levels of gastric acidity and therefore digestive corrosion (Andrews,1990). Nocturnal owls,in turn, have relatively low levels of acidity of gastric juices and corrosion whilst diurnal birds of prey feature intermediate acidity and corrosion of bone and dental remains. Signs of intrusive corrosion in Damiao specimens are very great for both bone and dental material in allthree localities,being most severe in DM01 (Fig. 3)and least pronounced but abundant in DM16.DM02 molars exhibits similar distribution of corrosion stages as dental material in both DM01 and DM16.However, incisors and molars are known to have different response to digestion (Andrews,1990; Fernandez-Jalvo et al.,2016) and when excluding incisors,it is evident that DM02 and DM01 are more alike.The high incidence of intrusive corrosion could also be of pedogenic rather than digestive origin. However, the former should affect all parts of the bone rather than just small parts of it (Andrews,1990). Considering that the fossils from Damiao are partially affected by corrosion and show other abundant predation-related taphonomic features, corrosion seems more likely to be the result of digestion for these localities.

The relatively high proportion of distal limb elements and low ratio of cranial to postcranial material together with lightly digested elements suggest the involvement of owls in DM16.Several fossilized predator pellets at or right above the richest fossil layer further support this interpretation.Additionally,a few discoloured teeth indicate that diurnal raptors may have contributed to the formation of the assemblage (cf.Andrews,199o; Mayhew,1977). For DM0l,the relatively low proportion of distal limb elements and high ratio of cranial to postcranial material point to diurnal raptor or mammalian predator as possible producers of the assemblage even without the discoloration which may be concealed by strong manganese coloration. Significant alteration by digestive processes in nearly all elements could favour a mammalian predator origin.For DMO2 the teeth exhibit similar evidence of digestion as in DM01, perhaps suggesting the same predator implicated in the deposit formation.

Indication of closed and humid environment for DM01 comes from the presence of the humid favouring pliopithecoid primate (Zhang and Harrison, 2008) as wellas anchitherine horse and the cervid Euprox alticus (Kaakinen et al.,2015; Wang and Zhang,2011). Sedimentological evidence also supports this with abundant goethite and manganese occurrence indicating more humid climate for DM1. However, the small mammal fauna in the entire sequence is dominated by rodents with only relatively few insectivores, which might indicate more dry and open environment (Klietmann et al., 2O15; Van den Hoek Ostende,2001） than that inferred from the large mammals. Taphonomy and preservational state of the specimens suggest that small mammals were collected within the fluvial system, however, the primary accumulators were predators. Predators, however, often prey outside their living habitats affecting the faunal composition of the fossil accumulation and further paleoecological interpretations based on the exposed fauna (e.g., Fernandez-Jalvo et al.,2016) and therefore small mammals from Damiao may represent habitats of some distance away. Yet many small mammal predators, even if hunting outside their living/nesting habitats,are rarely foraging far but within few kilometers distance depending on the stage of the breeding cycle and season (e.g., Hardey et al., 2O09 and references therein). It can be hypothesized that all three localities were predator accumulations that encountered fluvial transportation to the final burial sites.Based on taphonomy, sedimentology and fauna the environment was likely predominantly closed with more open surrounding areas as a gallery forest with surrounding grassland. The youngest locality, DMO1, was likely the most humid. ",
