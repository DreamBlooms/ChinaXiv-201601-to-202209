Collinear laser spectroscopy (CLS) has been proven to be a powerful tool to measure multiple nuclear properties of exotic nuclei [8,9]. In this technique, the hyperfine structure (hfs) and isotope shift due to the interaction between the atomic nucleus and surrounding electrons are probed to precisely extract the nuclear spins $( I )$ ,magnetic dipole moments $( \\mu )$ ,electric quadrupole moments $( Q _ { s } )$ ，and changes in the mean square charge radii $( \\delta \\left. r ^ { 2 } \\right. )$ of an isotopic chain ina nuclear model-independent manner.
