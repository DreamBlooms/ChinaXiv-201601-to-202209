In this study,the arid remote sensing ecological index (ARSEI) for large-scale arid areas was developed,which coupled the information of the greenness index,the salinity index,the humidity index,theheat index,and the land degradation index of arid areas.The ARSEI was used to monitor and evaluate the eco-environmental quality ofthe Aral Sea Basin from 20oO to 2019.The results show that the greennessindex,the humidity index and the land degradation index had a positive impact on the quality of the ecological environment in the Aral Sea Basin, while the salinity index and the heat index exerted a negative impact on the quality of the ecological environment. The eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin demonstrated a trend of initial improvement, followed by deterioration,and finally further improvement. The spatial variation of these changes was significant.From 2O to 2O19,grassand and wasteland (saline alkali land and sandy land) in the central and western parts of the basin had the worst ecological environment quality. The areas with poor ecological environment quality are mainly distributed in rivers, wetlands,and cultivated land around lakes. During the period from 2000 to 2019,except for the surrounding areas of the Aral Sea,the ecological environment quality in other areas of the Aral Sea Basin has been improved in general. The correlation coeficients between the change in the eco-environmental quality and the heat index and between the change in the eco-environmental quality and the humidity index were $- 0 . 5 9 3$ and O.524,respectively. Climate conditions and human activities have led to diferent combinations of heat and humidity changes in the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin.However,human activities had a greater impact.The ARSEI can quantitatively and intuitively reflect the scale and causes of large-scale and long-time period changes of the eco-environmental quality inarid areas; tis very suitable for the study of the eco-environmental quality inarid areas.

From the perspective of protecting the eco-environment, the scientific,comprehensive,and accurate assessment of the eco-environmental quality and its changes is crucial to regional development (Wang et al., 2015). It is necessary to evaluate the eco-environment quality of arid areas for the following reasons. First, in recent years，eco-environmental problems in arid areas，such as desertification， soil and grassland degradation， air pollution，and water pollution，have been progressively worsening. Eco-environmental quality assessment in arid areas has become an important research topic (Song et al.,2O12). Second, the eco-environment of arid areas is fragile,which makes the areas highly susceptible to natural and human activities and subject to secondary damage.The dynamic monitoring of the eco-environmental quality in arid areas is of great significance for water and soil conservation and ecological degradation prevention (Kang et al., 2O12; Jiang et al., 2019).

        "text": "Evaluations of the eco-environmental quality began in the 196Os and developed rapidly in the 1970s (Chai and Lha,2O18). However, initial assessments of the eco-environment quality mainly focused on specific elements,such as the water environment (Noges et al.,2Oo7),soil environment (Posthuma and Suter, 2011),and atmospheric environment (Park et al., 2013). Many research methods have been applied to different research objects including the analytic hierarchy process (Ying et al.,2O07), the fuzzy weighting method (Wei et al.,2O13),and the neural network method (Li and Zhang, 2O08). In recent years, with the rapid development of remote sensing methods and technology， the scope and efficiency of the eco-environmental quality assessment have been increased (Fan et al.,2O13),and many environmental indices have been developed, such as the National Wildlife Federation environmental quality index in the United States (Dagani,1990) and the total environmental quality index in Canada.In China,the eco-environmental status index (EI) was first proposed by the former Ministry of Environmental Protection of People's Republic of China (Zhang et al.,201O).In 2015,the former Ministry of Environmental Protection of People's Republic of China revised the index and enriched the information content of the evaluation indicators. In recent years, with the progress of 3S (RS, GIS,and GPS) technology, many 3S-based eco-environmental evaluation indices have been proposed. For example,the comprehensive index uses 1l indicators to evaluate the eco-environmental quality (Baig et al., 2O14; Sun et al., 2015), although data for some indicators are more difficult to obtain. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is a comprehensive eco-environmental evaluation index based on natural indicators, but it is more applicable to the county level (Xu et al., 2O18; Hu and Xu,2O19).Although the data for the index can be obtained more easily,the applicability of the index to arid areas needs to be further studied because the index is designed for use in urban environments. The eco-environment background value is more comprehensive and systematic in evaluating the eco-environmental quality by adopting remote sensing attributes,meteorological attributes,and natural attibutes as evaluation indicators. However, the scalesof previousresearch into monitoringthe eco-environmental quality are mostly county-level or township-level, with few larger scale studies. In addition, in terms of the study of the eco-environment quality in arid areas,previous studies adopted evaluation methods applicable to cities,which lack suitable evaluation indicators for the characteristics of arid environments. Therefore，in this study，we corrected this lack of eco-environmental quality evaluation in large-scale arid areas by developing a large-scale eco-environmental quality index suitable for arid areas,which can be used to temporally and spatially study the changes in and distribution of the eco-environment quality in arid areas.

The main land cover types in the basin include deserts, wetlands,and grasslands (Fig.1) (McDermid and Winter, 2O17). The climate of the Aral Sea Basin is extremely continental, with extreme desertification, small amounts of irregular precipitation, and large daily temperature differences and seasonal temperature diferences.Two main rivers run through the Aral Sea Basin: the Syr Darya River in the north and the Amu Darya River in the south. From 1960 to 1998,the lake surface shrank by about $60 \\%$ ，and the water volume decreased by about $80 \\%$ (Aladin,2Oo8). Since 2Ooo,as the climate continued to dry up, the water level dropped drastically,the lake area decreased significantly, several species became extinct, salt accumulation decreased, the amount of vegetation reduced, and the eco-environment was severely damaged. The Aral Sea is considered to be a typical case of ecosystem collpse. The ecosystem of the Aral Sea and the delta that flows into the Aral Sea have been almost destroyed completely (Keith et al., 2013). In addition,long-term and large-scale assessments of the eco-environment in the Aral Sea Basin are very scarce,and the spatial differentiation characteristics of the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea are rarely studied.

When the salt accumulation in the soil reaches a certain critical value,it inhibits the ability of crop roots to absorb water and nutrients,and can corrode plant roots, damaging the normal growth and development of crops. Soil salinization not only seriously damages the production potential of the soil, but also causes significant losses in agricultural production. In addition,the accumulation of salt changes the soil environment to promote the growth of halophyte plants，eventually leading to the deterioration of the eco-environment (Bennett, 2OO3). The salinity index is used to quantify and evaluate the impact of salinization on the eco-environmental quality in arid areas.In this study, the surface salinity index (SI-T) (Khan et al.,20O5; Allbed et al.,2014; Guo et al.,202Oa) was used as the salinity index.

Therefore, the land degradation index was selected as the component index of the ARSEI to obtain the general land degradation situation in the study area to enable real-time ecological protection. ",

The data for the land degradation intensity are partially missng due to incomplete data acquisition in the Aral Sea Basin. Therefore,in this study, we used an indirect method to extract the land degradation intensity information. Combined with the actual situation of the arid area, we applied the expert decision tree classification method (Jiang et al.,2O1O; Wang,2013) to determine the classification index of the land degradation intensity in arid areas according to the vegetation coverage,land cover,and slope from the ENVI,as shown in Equation 6 and Table 2. There are six grades of soil erosion: slight, mild,moderate,intense,extreme,and violent erosion. Slight soil erosion indicates that the ecosystem is not affected and basically does not need to be restored.Mild soil erosion implies that the ecosystem is slightly affected and can be easily recovered if reasonable measures are taken. Moderate soil erosion means that the ecosystem is partially damaged, and strong measures are needed to restore it. Intense soil erosion indicates the basic loss of ecosystem functions，which can be restored only by taking strong biological and engineering measures. Extreme soil erosion indicates the complete loss of ecosystem functions,which are difficult to be restored. Violent soil erosion implies that the ecosystem functions cannot be restored. The land degradation intensity of water areas,towns,and residential areas is slight. The analytic hierarchy process method (AHP) (Rastorguef et al., 2O15; Nyimbili et al., 2O18) was used to transform the land degradation intensity into the land degradation index using the YAAHP software (an analytic hierarchy process software produced by Shanxi Yuan Decision Software Technology Co. Ltd, China),as shown in Equation 7 and Table 3 (Guo et al., 2020b). ",

In addition, the correlations between the variance of the ARSEI and the variances of the greenness index and the salinity index both increased year by year.Thus,the influence of the greenness index and the salinity index on the change in the eco-environmental quality was also increasing year by year.

There was no change in the quality of the eco-environment in the area where the vegetation cover type was shrubs.

The RSEI was established for the urban environment, such as natural areas and arid areas, with a wide research area and a small urban area. Therefore,there are certain defects in its application in arid areas.In this study,based on the RSEI, we established the ARSEI by removing the surface dryness index (the building index and the surface bare soil index), which represents the urban environment, from the RSEI,and adding the salinity index and the land degradation index to characterize the environment of arid areas.The index has achieved good results in its application to the Aral Sea Basin.The application of this index to other arid areas requires follow-up analysis.

The quality of the regional eco-environment can be determined by the ecological carrying capacity and the social and economic conditions,so the ecological carrying capacity also indirectly reflects the quality of the eco-environment. Wu et al. (2020) evaluated and analyzed the ecological carrying capacity of the Aral Sea Basin from 2OOO to 2018, and found that the ecological carrying capacity of the Aral Sea Basin was mainly medium and poor, and that of the upstream area was beter than that of the downstream area, which is consistent with our assessment of the eco-environmental quality. They also revealed that the ecological carrying capacity of the Aral Sea Basin increased from 2O01 to 2O18, which agrees with our assessment that the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin improved from 20OO to 2019.After the disintegration of the Soviet Union at the end of the $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century, the central Asian countries experienced contradictions and conflicts in the allcation of water resources. The construction and maintenance of water conservancy facilities in the Aral Sea Basin were affected,and the production layout of the irrigation areas was also changed (Deng and Long,2O1la,b).As a result, the increases in the irigation area and reservoir capacity in the Aral Sea Basin slowed down,so did the shrinkage rate of the Aral Sea. In order to protect the Aral Sea,central Asian countries have continuously formulated and improved relevant policies on crossborder water resource management in recent years,including the water agreement of the five central Asian countries, the action plan for the environmental and socio-economic improvement in the Aral Sea area (2003- 2010),and the plan for the protection of the North Aral Sea. In recent years, the area of the Aral Sea stabilized and has even slightly expanded; these plans have achieved overal positive results (Yang et al.,2019). This demonstrates the correctness of our conclusions,i.e., the quality of the ecological environment in the Aral Sea Basin improved from 2OoO to 2019. ",

There is no large-scale change in the surface salinity of the Aral Sea Basin (Kumar, 2OO2). Therefore, the greenness index and the salinity index were not the decisive indices for the construction of the eco-environmental quality index in the Aral Sea Basin. The desertification of the Aral Sea Basin is severe,and the land degradation area is large (Wu et al., 2OO9). Moreover, the Aral Sea Basin belongs to a desert ecosystem.The climate in the Aral Sea Basin is dry all year round,and the soil moisture content is low,making it unsuitable for planting crops (Khamzina et al., 2O08). The second type of soil degradation is caused by the reclamation of cultivated land where the degree of land degradation is low. Therefore,the land degradation index is positively correlated with the eco-environmental quality, making it one of the decisive indicators for establishing the ARSEI. Surface temperature is one of the causes of surface droughts,so the heat index is also a decisive index for establishing the ARSEI. ",

There is a general warming trend in the Aral Sea Basin and a general trend of increasing precipitation, resulting in a noticeable transition from warm and dry to warm and humid (Micklin, 2004; Deng and Long,201la,b; Touge et al.,2015). Intense human activities (mainly agricultural irigation and continuous increase of reservoir water storage) are the main factors causing the severe shrinkage of the Aral Sea area and the deterioration of the eco-environment in the Aral Sea Basin (Jiang et al.,2017; Yang et al.,2O19).In this study，we compared the different impacts of human activities and climate change,and found that the impact of human activities was higher than that of climate change，which is consistent with the real situation. Consequently, one of the measures needed to improve the eco-environment of the Aral Sea Basin is to make rational use of water resources and to adjust the structure of the agricultural water mainly used for irrigation.

Diffrent land cover types have different surface water and heat contents and different degrees of land degradation.The main reason for the areas with the worst eco-environmental quality in the Aral Sea Basin is that the land cover in the basin is mainly desert and sandy land,with less surface water and more heat resources.From 2OOO to 2O19,the sharp deterioration of the wetland ecological environment around the Aral Sea was mainly caused by the fact that the area of the Aral Sea has been significantly reduced and the dried lakebeds and the river delta flowing into the Aral Sea have gradually turned into bare land. Therefore,the rational utilization of land resources is one of the measures needed to prevent the further deterioration of the eco-environment in the Aral Sea Basin. ",

We quantitatively and objectively analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution and the reasons for changes in the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin from 2OOO to 2O19.In the Aral Sea Basin, the heat index and the land degradation index are indispensable indicesfor building the ARSEI. From 200O to 2019，in general， the eco-environmental quality in the Aral Sea Basin was graded as worst, but with a trend of initial improvement, then deterioration，and finally further improvement. The basic reason for the temporal variation in the eco-environmental quality in the Aral Sea Basin from 2OOO to 2019 was the‘combined inter-annual change in the surface water and heat. The change in the eco-environmental quality was influenced by human activities more than by natural factors.
