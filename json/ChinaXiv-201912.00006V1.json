        "text": "Abstract: Trees growing in a semi-rid sandy environment are often exposed to drought conditions due to seasonal variations in precipitation,low soil water retention and deep groundwater level. However, adaptability and plasticity of individuals to the changing drought conditions greatly vary among tree species. In this study, we estimated water use $( T _ { \\mathrm { s } } )$ of Mongolian Scots pine (MSP; Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.） based on sap flux density measurements over four successive years (2O13-2016) that exhibited significant fluctuations in precipitation in a semi-arid sandy environment of northern China. The results showed that fluctuations in daily $T _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ synchronously varied with dry-wet cycles of soil moisture over the study period. The daily ratio of water use to reference evapotranspiration $( T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / \\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } } )$ on sunny days in each year showed a negative linear relationship with the severity of drought in the upper soil layer (0-1 m; $\\scriptstyle P < 0 . 0 1 { \\mathrm { ~ } }$ ). The decrease in $T \\mathrm { s }$ induced by erratic drought during the growing season recovered due to precipitation. However, this recovery ability failed under prolonged and severe droughts. The $T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / \\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ ratio significantly declined with the progressive reduction in the groundwater level $( g _ { \\mathrm { w } } )$ over the study period $( P { < } 0 . 0 1 )$ . We concluded that the upper soil layer contributed the most to the $T _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ of MSP during the growing season. The severity and duration of droughts in this layer greatly reduced $T _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ .Nevertheless, $g _ { \\mathrm { w } }$ （204 determined whether the $T _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ could completely recover after the alleviation of long-term soil drought. These results provide practical information for optimizing MSP management to stop ongoing degradation in the semi-arid sandy environments. ",

        "text": "Reforestation has been widely used in semi-arid areas to control soil erosion and to capture carbon for regional sustainability (D'Odorico and Porporato,2OO6). However, tree growth in water-limited ecosystems is often exposed to significant environment-related challenges,such as drought (Mereu et al., 2009;Wesche et al.,2011; Su et al.,2014). Many environmental factors influence the survival and growth of trees in semi-arid areas,for instance,amount and variability of precipitation, soil water storage and availability of groundwater (Meinzer et al., 2Oo6; Zhang Jinhu et al.， 2O18). Increasing frequency and severity of drought are known to have severe negative impacts on forest ecosystems and increase mortality rate of trees (Leo et al.,2Ol3; Barbeta et al.,2015; Gazol et al.，2018). Impacts of drought on ecological and hydrological processes associated with trees in fragile ecosystems have attracted sustained and intensive attention (Bovard et al., 2OO5). Quantification of tree water use and its long-term response to drought can aid in understanding of how trees adapt to a changing environment. ",

MSP is a popular tree species for reforestation in northern China due to its high tolerance to both drought and low temperature.

However, without frequent and long-term monitoring of tree water use and environmental variables,we stillhave limited knowledge of how and to what extent precipitation-dominated water availability is responsible for the degradation of MSP. Therefore,this study aims to: (1) quantify sap flux density and daily water use of MSP over four successive years (2013-2016) with contrasting precipitation fluctuations; (2） determine the linkage between variation in the daily tree water use and intra-seasonal dry-wet cycles of soil moisture; and (3) investigate the ability of tree water use recovery after long-term successive and severe droughts.

        "text": "In this study,moderate drought in the first dry year (2O14) and further severe drought in the second dry year (2Ol5) resulted in a marked decline in the water use of MSP. Compared with the normal year (2013),the daily $T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / T _ { \\mathrm { s - m a x } }$ was decreased by $32 \\%$ in 2014 and $62 \\%$ in 2015.The significant reduction in tree water use under drought conditions reflected the conservation of MSP in water consumption. This is consistent with the findings on Scots pine trees that have a very strong plastic response to intermittent drought (Levitt, 198O; Arneth et al., 2O06; Verbeeck et al., 2007; Mereu et al., 2O09). It was reported that the main water source for MSP was from soil moisture in the upper soils (Su et al., 2006; Wei et al.,2013; Song et al., 2014). This result was supported by our findings that water use of MSP was mainly dependent on soil moisture in the upper $0 { - } 1 \\mathrm { m }$ soil layer. In general, the value of $T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / \\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ ratio linearly decreased with the decline of $\\mathsf { R E W } _ { 0 - 1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } }$ in each year,and the slopes were more negative in the years within and after severe drought than in the normal year (2O13) (Fig. 5). Therefore,water availability in the $0 { - } 1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ soil layer is important for the water use of MSP due to the shallow-rooted traits of MSP that $8 5 \\%$ roots of MSP are occurred in the $0 . 0 { - } 0 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ soil layer (Jiang et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2008).

Water use of MSP in two successive dry years could not recovery to the normal year (2O13) (Fig.3e). The incomplete recovery of water use of MSP under the non-drought conditions in 2O16 could be attributed to the variation in hourly $T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / \\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ that accounted for $89 \\%$ of that in 2O13. This result is consistent with the reports that changes in soil moisture affect water use,but the constraints likely remain over a long period after droughts (Yan et al.,2O16).It is previously reported that fine roots of Scots pine die quickly under drought conditions (Vanguelova and Kennedy,2OO7), which might be the main direct cause of the decline in water use capacity even after soil water status was recovered.

        "text": "A deep taproot enables trees to use water from deep soils and/or groundwater under drought conditions (Barbeta et al., 2015; Hentschel et al.,2016). MSP is a dimorphic-rooted species with a maximum taproot depth of $5 . 2 0 \\textrm { m }$ ，which was observed in a 42-year-old tree in sandy soil near our site (Jiang et al., 2OO2). The water absorption by the deeper taproots of MSP was measured by isotopic technique when soil water content in the upper $0 . 6 \\mathrm { { m } }$ soil layer declined to $3 . 6 \\%$ (Wei et al.,2013; Song et al.,2O16a). This finding was supported by our results of the extreme depletion of soil water in the $1 { - } 2 \\mathrm { m }$ soil layer. Meanwhile, $g _ { \\mathrm { w } }$ value decreased from 4.88 to $5 . 8 2 \\mathrm { m }$ over the studied period,and in 2014, $g _ { \\mathrm { w } }$ value was much lower than the maximum depth of taproot $( 5 . 2 0 \\mathrm { m } )$ ： Considering the findings that $T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / \\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ ratio during the daytime on sunny days decreased linearly with the decline in groundwater levels (Fig. 7)，we concluded that significant decline in groundwater levels was partly responsible for the reduced tree water use even when soil water availability was gradually recovered. The impact of groundwater on tree water use was most prominent under extensive and prolonged drought conditions, which was greatly but incompletely replaced by reweted upper soil. The results from MSP in this study are consistent with the report that dependence of trees on groundwater increases as precipitation decreases (Kume et al., 2007). ",

Although soil moisture in the upper layer was easily recharged from the precipitation,it rapidly decreased in a short term even at higher initial soil moisture conditions in the sandy soil due to the soil texture and strong evaporation (Fig. 4). Therefore, droughts tended to occur more frequently in the sandy soil due to the high inter-monthly variations in precipitation. Moreover, coarse sandy soil effectively prevents capillary rise of water (less than $0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m } \\dot { }$ ）(Vincke and Thiry,2Oo8). It is reasonable that the contribution of groundwater to upper soil moisture by capillary rise is non-significant due to $5 9 1 \\%$ sand particles in the upper $2 \\mathrm { m }$ soil layer in the studied plot. As a result, more than half of days in the dry years (2O14 and 2O15) were drought, which was believed to induce persistent water stress on the growth of MSP. ",

In our study, $T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / \\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ ratio generally declined with a decrease in the upper soil moisture. $T _ { \\mathrm { s } } / \\mathrm { E T _ { 0 } }$ ratio also showed a significant difference between diferent drought levels and recovered to a certain extent when the whole soil layer was thoroughly rewetted in 2O16 (Fig.5b). This study reported the plasticity of MSP under severe drought conditions through the drastic reduction in water use. Additionally,the lateral roots of an MSP tree can extend to lengths that are approximately 0.65 times that of tree height (Jiang et al.， 2O02； Su et al., 2006)，which also helps MSP trees to efficiently obtain water from the upper soil layer (Song et al.，2O14). However,incomplete recovery of water use revealed that prolonged and severe droughts might greatly limit the ability of trees to adapt to climate change. In addition to random drought episodes that can greatly reduce water use, the progressive decline rate in the groundwater level ( $\\mathrm { ( 1 ~ m / a ) }$ induced by extensive and/or intensive agricultural land use and broadleaved forests plantation in the study area (Song et al.,2016b) also prevented the recovery of water use,both of which would cause a deficit in the water supply and serious degradation of forest stands if allowed to continue for two or more growing seasons. As a countermeasure against the ongoing degradation of MSP, it is more effective and more urgent to prevent unrestrained exploitation of groundwater by reducing agricultural land or converting into other land use such as coniferous forest and shrubland than by merely adjusting stand density of MSP.

Consequently, water use of MSP strongly responded to soil water availability,especially in the upper $1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ soil layer,as these trees are shallow-rooted species. Severe and prolonged soil drought greatly decreased water use of MSP in a short term. The progressive decline in groundwater restricted the degree of water use recovery in MSP even if the soil was reweted by precipitation. Our results suggested that the degradation of MSP plantations is attributable to the high temporal variations in precipitation,low soil water retention and declining groundwater level. In addition to adjusting planting density and stand structure, preventing groundwater level from decreasing by reducing irrigated farmland area is recommended as an alternative method to stop ongoing degradation of MSP in the Horqin Sandy Land of northern China.
