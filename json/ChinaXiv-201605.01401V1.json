Here we showed that coculture with macrophages significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of PPARy on its target genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and diabetic primaryadipocytes,depending on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).We further showed that PPARy underwent S-nitrosylation in response to nitrosative stres.Mass-spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that S-nitrosylation at cysteine 168 was responsible for the impairment of PPARy function. Extended exposure to NO instigated the proteasome-dependent degradation of PARy.Consistently,in vivo evidence revealed an association of the decreased PPARy protein level with increased macrophage infiltration in visceral adipose tissue (VAT)of obese diabetic db/db mice.Together,our results demonstrated that pro-inflammatory macrophages suppressed PPARy activity in adipocytes via S-nitrosylation,suggesting a novel mechanism linking metabolic inflammation with insulin resistance.

In addition to the function as an energy storage tissue,adipose tissue secrets a series ofadipokines includingadiponectin to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism in other insulin sensitive tissues such as liver and skeletal muscles[1].In obesityand other metabolic disorders,the uptake of excessive nutrients and energy causes a metabolic surplus,leading to a chronic low-grade inflammation status called metabolic inflammation or meta-inflammation [2]. In adipose tissues of obese and diabetic animals and patients,the metabolic inflammation is featured with the infiltration and activation of macrophages,impaired insulin sensitivity and dysfunctional secretion of adipokines [3-5].

        "text": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARy),a member of nuclear receptor superfamily,is highly expressed inadipose tissues.PPARy isa master regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism [6,7].PPARy heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor- $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\vec { \\mathbf { u } } }$ binds to specific PPAR-responsive elements(PPRE）in the target genes,and leads to their transcriptional activations upon the ligand binding[8]. Thiazolidinediones（TZDs） including rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are synthetic ligands selective for PPARy and have been widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as insulin sensitizers [9,1O]. The insulin sensitizing effects of TZDs are predominantly mediated by the actions of PPARy in adipose tissues viaat least the two mechanisms:1) promoting the uptake of glucose and free fatty acids for adipogenesis,and therefore decreasing their levels in circulation;aP2 (fatty acidbinding protein 4,FABP4）[11]，stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) [12],acyl-CoA synthetase,and perilipin [13] are among the PPARy target genes responsible for this mechanism;2) inducing the expression of adipokine genes such as adiponectin to improve the insulin signaling in other organs [14,15]. In expanding adipose tissue,monocytes and macrophages are recruited and activated, exhibiting pro-inflammatory features.These pro-inflammatory (classically activated）macrophages release a series of pro-inflammatory factors like TNFα,IL- $1 \\beta$ ,IL-6 and nitric oxide(NO). Among them,excessive NO derived from inducible NO synthase (iNOS）acts with reactive oxidative species(ROS）to produce a nitrosative stress [16] which may impair adipocyte function [17,18].Nitrosative stress can trigger a redox sensitive process called protein S-nitrosylation [19], i.e. the reaction of thiols at the cysteine residues in the substrate proteins with NO or NO-derived species,forming -SNO group[2O]. S-nitrosylation is an important mechanism by which NO exerts its physiological and pathological functions [21,22].Previous studies indicated that macrophages inhibited adipocyte differentiation viaa paracrine action[23].In addition，NO donor blunted PPARy activity in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes [24].However, the molecular mechanism by which NO suppresses PPARy function remains unknown.

Increased NO or protein S-nitrosylation Was also reported to affect insulin action.In db/db or ob/ob obese diabetic mice,diet-induced obesity and liver-specific iNOS transgenic mice,increased S-nitrosylation repressed insulin receptor $\\beta$ (IRβ）and Akt activity,or insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1）expression，blunting the insulin action in skeletal muscle and liver [33-35].NO donors also impaired anti-lipolytic action of insulin by S-nitrosylation of phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) in cultured adipocytes or mice [36]. Here,our finding that suppression of PPARy by S-nitrosylation provides a new mechanism of insulin resistance caused by macrophage-derived NO during obesityand obese diabetes.However, pro-inflammatory macrophages also secreted several other proinflammatory factors such as IFNy.These pro-inflammatory cytokines also impair the adipocytes'function and contribute to insulin resistance.This notion is supported by the fact that the suppressive effect of pro-inflammatorymacrophages on the PPARy target geneinadipocyteswas largelyattenuated but not fullyabolished bythe iNOS inhibitor(Fig.1C,D).

It was reported that deletion of thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip，or VDUP1,TBP-2)，a protein inhibiting Trx activity [41,42],enhanced PPARy activity and the rosiglitazone-stimulated adipogenesis,preserving insulin sensitivity [43].These results indicated that denitrosylation protected PPARy function,corroborating that PPARy function is impaired by S-nitrosylation.

        "text": "We found that S-nitrosylation inhibits PPARy through two distinct mechanisms.Firstly,short term exposure to GSNO caused theS-nitrosylation of PPARy leading to decreased transcriptional activity，asevidenced bya reduced activation of PPARy target genes adiponectin and aP2 (Figs.1,2) as well as the PPARy reporter activity. This was likely due to the location of the thiolmodified cysteine within the DBD of PPARy (cysteine 168) Therefore,the S-nitrosylation decreased the ligand-induced PPARy binding to the target genes (Fig.3). In fact, S-nitrosylation of the cysteine residues within DBD in several other transcription factors including NFkB,androgen receptor,MEF2 and c-myb has been documented to repress their transcriptional activities [44-47]. Thiol-modification was known to disrupt the conformational flexibility of the DBD [46,47]. On the other hand,extended exposure to nitrosative stress further impaired the protein stability of PPARy (Fig.7A).This could be attributed to the accelerated degradation of PPARy in proteasome because the proteasome inhibitor MG132 partially rescued the GSNO induced degradation (Fig.7C).Itisworth noting that lysosome pathway might also be involved in this process since the degradation was prevented in the presence of MG132 and $\\mathsf { N H } _ { 4 } \\mathsf { C l }$ ,a lysosome inhibitor (Fig.7D). Asa de-nitrosylating agent,NAC decreased the S-nitrosylation of PPARy(Fig.4B)and the PPARy degradation induced by GSNO (Fig.7B),supporting a role of S-nitrosylation in decreasing the PPARy stability.

Surprisingly,PPARy protein level was significantly decreased compared to the control db/m mice (Fig. 8C).A similar decrease in PPARy protein level was previously reported in adipose tissue from obese women with gestational diabetes [48].Whether the decreased PPARy level in VAT of db/db mice resulted from the chronic nitrosative stress and accelerated degradation remains to beinvestigated.
