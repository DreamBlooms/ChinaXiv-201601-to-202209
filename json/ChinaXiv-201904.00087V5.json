        "text": "When asked questions that are framed by moral action rather than by moral judgment, dualprocess moral theory posits that people will tend to be more deontological or more sensitive to norms because of a stronger moral-disgust arousal to a sacrifice proposal (e.g., sacrifice one innocent life to save five or more others). However, the action-based model of cognitive dissonance predicts that the decision-maker willbe less deontological or less sensitive to norms because of the stronger motivation process to reduce the dissonance state. A traditional moral dilemma paradigm (Study 1) was applied and the results supported the prediction of actionbased model of cognitive dissonance. To further probe which of norm sensitivity,consequence sensitivity and generalized action/inaction preference matters in moral question-framing effect, a 2 (norm: proscriptive/prescriptive) $\\times 2$ (consequence: benefits greater than/smaller than costs) × 2 (frame: moral judgment/moral action） within-subject design with Consequencesgeneralized Action/inaction-Normssensitivity (CAN） algorithm (Study 2） anda Consequences-Norms-generalized Inaction/action preferences (CNI) model design (Study 3) were comprehensively applied. Together, the results show that participants were less sensitive to norms, were more sensitive to consequences, and transitioned from a generalized action preference to a generalized inaction preference when they were asked moral action- versus moral judgment-framed questions. Thus, the present research supports the explanations of action-based model of cognitive dissonance and reveals that moral decision-making is affected by the motivation process. Theoretical and methodological implications are also discussed. ",

        "text": "An often-discussed moral dilemma involves people having to decide whether they would sacrifice one innocent person to save five or more others. If they approve of the sacrifice proposal, they obey the utilitarian principle claiming on greatest benefits while disobey the deontological principle of not killing any innocent person. If they disapprove of the sacrifice proposal, they obey deontological principle while disobey utilitarian principle. Confronting this dilemma situation, two types of question are typically asked, namely “Is it morally acceptable to perform the described action (e.g. sacrificing one innocent to save five others)?\" and “Would you perform the described action?\". The answers to these two questions may be different as the former focuses on the moral acceptance of the proposed behavior whereas the latter focuses on the implementation of the moral proposal. This phenomenon is known as the “moral-question framing efect’. The discrepancies between judgment and action choices in moral decision-making were identified by many researchers (Baron，1992； Gawronski, Armstrong, Conway, Friesdorf, & Huter, 2017; Patil, Cogoni, Zangrando, Chittaro,& Silani, 2014; Tassy, Oullier, Mancini, & Wicker,2013).   \nThe moral-question framing effect is very particular among the framing effects in moral decision-making domain. Previous found framing effects in moral decision-making mainly addressed that moral decisions can be affected by the descriptive language frames of the scenarios (Bohm & Theelen,2016; Broeders, van den Bos,Muller,& Ham, 2011; Cao et ",

The “trolley problem”can be used as an example: although the moral nature of the proposal is the sacrifice of an innocent person and the moral consequence is saving five people, moral acceptance has been found to be lower when the behavior proposal is framed as pushing the innocent person from a bridge than when framed as pressing a button to switch the trolley pathway (Greene et al., 2OO1). Greene postulated that this is because “pushing” has a more personal connotation than “pressing”and further evokes additional moral disgust in relation to the sacrifice, whereas “pressing\" induces a more rational consideration of the result of the proposed behavior than“pushing\"; consequently,“pressing” was accepted more often than was “pushing.” However, differently in moral question-framing effect, both the scenario and the behavior proposal are consistent across the two types of questions.The only difference is the question formulation which emphasizes on behavior acceptance or behavior execution.

        "text": "The first potential explanation can be driven from dual-process morality theory through which emotion arousal is related to deontological decisions while rational reasoning corresponds to utilitarian decisions; this theory was verified in several previous studies (Greene, 2007, 2009; Greene et al., 2009; Greene, Moreli, Lowenberg, Nystrom,& Cohen, 2008). In the literatures, many framing-effects have been explained by the dual-process morality theory, such as how the goal frames of \"kill’ or“save\"(Broeders et al., 2011; Petrinovich & O'Neill, 1996),the action frames of\"push\" or\"don't push\"(Pastotter et al.,2013),and the consequence frames of\"gain” or “loss” (Bohm & Theelen, 2016; Cao et al.,2017; De Dreu & McCusker, 1997; de Heus et al., 2010; Evans & van Beest, 2017) affect moral decisions.Among these framing effects,different frames activate different propensities of cognition and emotion. Individuals tend to be utilitarian when strengthening a rational cognitive propensity but deontological when enhancing emotional arousal， especially feelings of moral disgust (Cushman, Young,& Greene,2010; Greene,2007; Greene et al.,2008; Greene & Paxton, 2009; Rand, Greene, & Nowak, 2012). Previous research has shown that individuals exhibit more emotions in relation to moral action implementation than moral proposal acceptance (Pletti, Loto,Buodo,& Sarlo,2017). This suggests that, based on dual-process morality theory, when a question is framed by the moral action rather than by the moral judgment, individuals should be more averse to sacrifice and tend to refuse sacrifice proposal, signifying that they would be more sensitive to moral norms accounted by deontological principle. However, the results of Gawronski. et al (2017) indicate partly opposite conclusion; namely, individuals become less sensitive to moral norms and prefer more generalized refusal to the sacrifice proposal under the moral action frame than under the moral judgment frame. The discrepancy of generalized preference under moral action frame and moral judgment frame can be explained by dual process morality theory. As more sacrifice disgust emotion is activated under moral action frame than under moral judgment frame (Pletti, Lotto, Buodo,& Sarlo, 2017), individuals under moral action frame became overall more likely to refuse the sacrifice proposal. However, the discrepancy of sensitivity to moral norms can not be explained by dual process morality which implies more sensitive to moral norms under moral action frame than under moral judgment frame,while the results turn opposite. Therefore, there should be alternative explanations for moral question-framing effect. ",

        "text": "Based on the analysis of the dilemma situations,action-based model of cognitive dissonance (Harmon-Jones & Harmon-Jones, 20o2; Harmon-Jones, Harmon-Jones,& Levy, 2015；Harmon-Jones,Amodio,& Harmon-Jones, 2009） might be the potential alternative explanation for moral question-framing effect. Confronting the dilemma, individuals may be observed to endure a potential moral violation regardless of the decisions they make, especially in cases in which dilemmas comprise proscriptive norms and consequences of benefits greater than costs. Potential violations of moral principles (no matter utilitarianism or deontology) threaten individual's positive moral self image and this mental conflict results in an ethical dissonance state (Barkan, Ayal, & Ariely, 2O15), motivating the affected individual to reduce such dissonance when making decisions. According to action-based model of dissonance, cognitive incongruence can induce not only cognitive dissonance but also dissonance reduction. The action-based model then suggests that the negative afective state of dissonance is aroused not by all cognitive conflict but specifically when cognitions with action implications conflict with one another, making it difficult to act (Harmon-Jones et al., 2O15). Regarding traditional moral-dilemma decisions, individuals may consider that the sacrifice proposal potentially violates norms of not killing but that the consequence is considerably beneficial, or vice versa. Thus, it is difficult to decide whether or not conduct the proposed behavior. Aiming to reduce the dissonance state, individuals in the action frame condition will demonstrate more diffusion of alternatives than will individuals in judgment frame condition. Specifically， they will consider the alternative choices and extend these to rationalize other options (Harmon-Jones & Harmon-Jones, 2002; Harmon-Jones et al.,2009; Proulx, Inzlicht, & Harmon-Jones,2012). Consequently, although individuals are overall aversive to the sacrifice proposal and refuse it, they would be motivated to consider the alternative choices and more tend to approve the sacrifice proposal under action frame than under judgment frame.

Five workers are stuck in the track just in front of the trolley car, and they would be killed if the trolley car keeps moving. You can press a button to turn the trolley car to the sidetrack and run over only one worker. If you press, the one worker would die and the five workers would be saved. Two types of questions would be asked,“Is it morally acceptable to perform the described action?” [i.e.， moral judgment] or “Would you perform the described action?” [i.e.， moral action]. In the logic of dual process morality, action framing-question induces more emotional disgust to sacrifice innocent than judgment framing-question, as a result, individuals in action framing-question condition will tend to refuse pressing the button MoRE than whom in judgment framing-question condition. However, in the view of action-based model of cognitive dissonance,the action framingquestion motivates individuals to reduce the cognitive dissonance state induced by the mental conflict of the situation while the judgment framing-question will not motivate the dissonance reduction. Therefore, individuals in action framing condition would consider that press the button is a beneficial alternative although overall， they refuse to do that. Accordingly, individuals in action framing-question condition will tend to refuse pressing the button LESS than whom in judgment framing-question condition.

Generally, the binary classification of utilitarianism and deontology is ambiguous. Such as the trolley problem, pressing the button represents utilitarian response focusing on the greater benefits than costs while not pressing the button represents deontological response focusing on the moral norms underlying the behavior. However, when individuals tend more likely to press the button, it has three potential possibilities. The first is that the individuals have a weaker norm sensitivity and are less aversive to the sacrifice proposal. The second is that the individuals have a stronger consequence sensitivity and found the results of the proposed behavior is considerably beneficial. The third is that the individuals just want to approve the proposal irrespective of the norms and consequences behind. The traditional dilemma paradigm can not dissociate the three possibilities. Thus,we can not tell which of norm sensitivity, consequence sensitivity and generalized action preference matters in the moral questionframing effect under traditional dilemma paradigm. ",

These four types of dilemmas actually constitute a 2 (norm: proscriptive/prescriptive) $\\times 2$ (consequence: benefits greater than/smaller than costs） within-subject design. Therefore, we can run a within-subject ANOVA to detect whether exist significant main effects of norm and consequence and their interaction. Moreover, based on the above $2 \\times 2$ design, a new algorithm could be used to export three estimates relatively representing norm sensitivity, consequence sensitivity and a generalized action/inaction preference, named CAN algorithm (Liu, & Liao, in review): Consequence sensitivity index (C parameter) $\\mathbf { \\Sigma } =$ (p(approval ratio | proscriptive norm, benefits $>$ costs) $+ p$ (approval ratio | prescriptive norm, benefits $>$ costs) $- p$ (approval ratio 丨proscriptive norm, benefits $<$ costs) $- p$ (approval ratio |prescriptive norm, benefits $<$ costs))/2; ",

If C/N parameter is greater (less) than zero, then the participants are identified as being sensitive to supporting (opposing) the norm/consequence. The bigger the C/N parameter, the more sensitive they are to supporting the norm/consequence. If A parameter is greater (less) than O.5, then the participants are identified as having a generalized action (inaction) preference.

Therefore, we avoided the priori hypothesis of sequential processing and applied a common subtracting strategy of parameter estimation. (b) CNI model exports the parameters in a group estimation level， thus it can not be used in a correlation/regression design and the parameters can only be compared across two groups or to a specific value. However, CAN algorithm exports the parameters in an individual estimation level and overcomes these limitations.

The bigger value of I parameter in CNI model represents a stronger general Inaction preference while the bigger value ofA parameter in CAN algorithm represents a stronger general Action preference. (d) The I parameter in CNI model is dissociated from norms/consequences sensitivities. It represents the group's generalized preference on the condition of being not driven by norms or consequences. However， the A parameter in CAN algorithm is not dissociated from norms/consequences sensitivities. It represents the individual's generalized preference including all the influencing factors' effects.

When facing a moral dilemma, individuals endured potential moral violations regardless of the decisions they made. This induced a subjective feeling of dissonance and motivated individuals to reduce this state of dissonance. When considering moral action, participants had greater motivations toward reducing dissonance and tended to consider the reasonableness of conducting the moral proposal. This is the same mechanism as spreading the alternatives (Harmon-Jones et al., 2009; Harmon-Jones et al.,2015). Consequently, the moral action frame induced less deontological propensity than the moral judgment frame. The dualprocess model of morality cannot explain this deontological reduction phenomenon. Participants became less (but not more) deontological under the moral action frame than under the moral judgment frame, although previous research revealed that the moral action frame evoked more emotional involvement than did the moral judgment frame (Gawronski et al., 2017; Pletti et al., 2017).

Regarding the results of Study 1, the increase in moral acceptance under the moral action frame relative to the moral judgment frame could be explained as either a deontological reduction or a utilitarian enhancement. This ambiguity may be partly due to the conceptual manipulation.In the case of the traditional moral dilemma, only one combined situation (proscriptive norm and benefits greater than costs) was considered and not the other three combined situations (proscriptive norm and benefits smaller than costs; prescriptive norm and benefits greater than costs; prescriptive norm and benefits smaler than costs).

However, this effect existed only under the conditions of the prescriptive norm and of benefits being smaller than costs, but not under the conditions of the proscriptive norm and of benefits being greater than costs. This result supports the action-based model of dissonance. The conditions of the proscriptive norm and of benefits being greater than costs were in accordance with an individual's moral principles, either deontological or utilitarian. This ensured that they would not encounter cognitive dissonance and that they would not spread their alternative choices when considering moral action rather than moral judgment. Under the conditions of the prescriptive norm and of benefits being smaller than costs, an individual's moral principles were challenged and they encountered cognitive dissonance; thus, they adjusted their choices motivationally when considering moral action rather than moral judgment.   \nIt is worth noting that the discrepancies between the three methods of analyses demonstrate the necessity of considering comprehensively all the combinations of norms and consequences to deepen our insights regarding moral decisions. The traditional dilemma paradigm considered only the condition of the proscriptive norm with benefits being greater than costs,while the process dissociation approach extended to the two situations of the proscriptive norm and benefits being either greater or smaller than costs.The ANOVA method with CAN algorithm included the four combinations of norm and consequence and showed that the moral action frame not only weakened norm sensitivity but also strengthened consequence sensitivity and decreased the generalized action/inaction preference.   \nWith the new CAN algorithm, two new findings from Gawronski et al.

Thus, based on their study, compared with the moral judgment frame, the moral action frame may not transform participants' generalized action preference into a generalized inaction preference. Conversely, this transformation phenomenon was very significant in our study.   \nHowever, the algorithm validity together with the new findings needs to be assessed further. In addition, the continuous rating scales used in Studies 1 and 2 may not represent participants' definite yes/no atitude. Therefore, using a binary yes-or-no response in Study 3, the mature and efective CNI model was used to measure independently the sensitivities to norm/consequence and generalized inaction/action preference,as well as to evaluate the proposed CAN algorithm and the associated findings in Study 2. Furthermore, the robustness of Studies 1 and 2 was tested again. ",

Thus, in our study, the participants endured cognitive dissonance and dissonance reduction through alternative spreading in relation to both the norm and consequence aspects,further demonstrating the moral-question framing effects.Alternatively, in Western cultures, individuals may focus on the moral norm nature of the proposal but may not care as much about the consequence, and they do not show a moral-question framing effect in consequence.

The first reason for this is the theoretical concept-manipulation differences that have already been discussed by Gawronski et al. (2O17). The dual-process morality theory considers only the one situation of the proscriptive norm alongside benefits being greater than costs, while the present Studies 2 and 3,as well as Gawronski's work, covered the four combinations of norm and consequence. The second reason relates to the underlying process differences. The dual-process model of morality mainly discusses the cognitive and emotional processes， but not the motivation process. The moral action frame is associated with a stronger acting motivation than that of the moral judgment frame,which could cause individuals to spread their choices. Regarding the stronger sacrificial disgust emotion evoked by the moral action frame compared with the moral judgment frame (Gawronski et al., 2017; Pleti et al., 2017), this may simply reinforce the individual's generalized inaction preference,which could not be dissociated in the previous studies.

Therefore, they did not endure significant cognitive dissonance and would not change their choices under the moral action frame more than they would under the moral judgment frame.

The mainstream moral theory of dual process focuses on the competitive processes of cognition and emotion. It provides a strong explanation with respect to moral judgment but not when considering moral action. The present research, together with that of Gawronski et al. (20l7), draws our attention to the motivation process when considering moral actions. Individuals enduring dissonance with their default moral principles willadjust their choices when considering moral action compared with moral judgment. This tendency can be explained by the action-based model of dissonance (Harmon-Jones & Harmon-Jones,2002; Harmon-Jones et al.,20o9; Harmon-Jones et al.,2015), implying that individuals are pursuing a balance between norm and consequence. Therefore, the action-based model of cognitive dissonance may be used to explain the motivation process of a moral decision, complementing the dual-process model's explanation of cognition and emotion. The dual-process morality theory could be used to explain the general action/inaction preference discrepancy between moral action and moral judgment frames, while the actionbased model of cognitive dissonance could explain all the index changes of norm/consequence sensitivity and generalized action/inaction preferences between the two frames.

This advantage over the CNI model should be considered in future studies. Therefore,ANOVA and the CNI model should be comprehensively used as necessary. Furthermore, Hütter and Klauer (2016) proposed that the model based on a multinomial processing tree should be applied only in a within-subject design. This insight was utilized to develop the present research methodology and the moral question frames were also within subject designed. This may explain why we obtained a more robust effect than Gawronski et al. (2O17).

For this reason, we conducted the pilot study to guarantee the morality relevance of the scenarios. Based on the pilot study, the most morality-relevant scenarios were adopted. Furthermore, familiarity with the scenarios could be a noise variable if we selected the scenarios from reallife instead of fictitious scenarios. Therefore, we did consider this possible limitation before beginning the study and developed the “air pollution\"and“jump the queue” dilemma scenarios based on everyday life experience.

Especially in the simple effect analyses of Studies 2 and 3,the question framing effects did not appear when there were proscriptive norms and when benefits were greater than costs, but they appeared when there were prescriptive norms and when benefits were less than costs.This result means that the participants were not randomly adjusting their answers but were adjusting them based on whether the situations contradicted their moral principles. Let us assume that participants were anchored when answering the first question and adjusted their answers when presented with the second question regardless of whether the question was framed by moral judgment or moral action.If this is true, the response patterns should be the same across all the scenarios. However, the response patterns in Studies 2 and 3 were not the same across the four editions of scenarios that combined norms and consequences. Therefore,the response order of the questions did not interfere significantly with the results, and future studies could also apply a fixed random order to verify this result further. ",
