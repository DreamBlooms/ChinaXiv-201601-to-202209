Compounding polymer resin with conductive filler can generate excellent electromagnetic interference-shielding effectiveness but usually leads to a high-sample density，,while the foaming of polymer composite suffers from the significant-reduced electromagnetic interference-shielding efectiveness.In this study,polyetherimide composite foams with loading of l0-80 phr (parts per hundred of resins) nickel particles were fabricated to meet the gap. The polyetherimide/nickel composite foams possessed uniform cell structure and lowsample density such as $0 . 8 6 g / { \\mathrm { c m } } ^ { 3 }$ at 70 phr nickel. The coupling effects of gravity settlement and cell-structure solidification led to the formation of gradient distribution of nickel particles across the foams. The formed novel structure facilitated the enhancement of multi-reflection and multi-scattering among nickel particles and cels.As a consequence, polyetherimide/nickel foam with 70 phr nickel (PEIN70) possessed a high-electromagnetic interference shielding efectiveness of 86.7-l06.5 dB over a frequency range of 50-3000 ",

The use of carbonbased materials for EMI shielding is very popular because of their low density.A high-EMI SE value of $6 0 \\mathrm { d B }$ at $1 \\mathrm { G H z }$ was obtained by Jou et al.5 in LCP nanocomposites with loading of $40 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ nanotube.A similar data were achieved at PEIN60 foam in this study.As the value of the EMI SE was divided by the sample density, however, the specific EMI SE of the former was much lower than that of the later,i.e. ${ \\sim } 4 6 . 0$ VS $1 3 3 . 2 \\mathrm { d B } / ( \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ .The EMI SE of flexible graphite,made by the compression of exfoliated graphite in the absence of a binder,reaches $1 3 0 \\mathrm { d B }$ at $1 \\mathrm { G H z }$ ，which is higher than or comparable to all the reported EMI-shielding materials.35 The density of flexible graphite is $1 . 1 \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ ,and the calculated specific EMI SE is about $1 1 8 . 1 \\mathrm { d B } / \\$ $( \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } )$ .

On the other hand, the presence of Ni particles increased the foam density gradually but did not change the expansion ratio of PEIN foams.At higher Ni contents of 70 and $8 0 \\mathrm { p h r }$ ,PEIN foams showed the reduced expansion ratio due to the occurrence of cell coalescence.Ni particles have a much higher density than that of PEI solution, which lead to the precipitation of Ni particles under gravity during the solidification process of cell structure. The coupling effects of gravity settlement and cel-structure solidification induced the formation of gradient distribution of Ni particles across the foams.The presence of gradient distribution of Ni particles enhanced the multi-refection and multi-scattering,which endowed with PEIN composite foams with excellent-specific EMI SE.
