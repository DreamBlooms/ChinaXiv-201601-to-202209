Here we sorted BCSCs from bladder tumor tissues or normal bladder stem cells (NBBCs) from adjacent normal bladder tissues.We found that the C228T mutation (chr5,1,295,228 $\\mathbf { c } > \\mathsf { T } )$ ）of TERT promoter frequently occurs in BCSCs,but not exist in NBBCs. Importantly, introducing the C228T mutation in NBBCs causes TERT overexpression and transformation of bladder cancer. Restoration of the C228T mutation to T228C in BCSCs can recover the TERT expression to a basal level and abolish tumor formation. Additionally, the C228T mutation of TERT promoter triggers TERT expression leading to increased telomerase activity. TERT expression levels are consistent with clinical severity and prognosis of bladder cancer. ",

The majority of bladder cancers are histologically classified as urothelial carcinomas [3]. Urothelial carcinomas originate from the bladder urothelium consisting of basal,intermediate,and umbrella cells, representing early,mid,and later differentiation states, respectively [4]. Malignant transformation can occur in any of these cell types that gives rise to tumors with diverse phenotypes [5]. Over $70 \\%$ is non-muscle-invasive tumors, whereas the remainder is muscle-invasive tumors [6]. However,the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer remains elusive. ",

The major telomere maintenance needs the telomerase that synthesizes de novo telomeres [12]. Telomerase is composed of twosubunits:telomerase RNA template (TERC), and telomerase reverse transcriptase（TERT） catalytic subunit [13]. Analyses of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas revealed two somatic TERT gene promoter mutations [14]. These mutations form de novo consensus binding motifs for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors,leading to TERT activation.Recent studies have reported that TERT is implicated in the modulation of cancer stem cells [15,16].Here we show that the C228T mutation of TERT promoter highly occurs in bladder cancer stem cells and this mutation contributes to tumorigenesis of bladder cancer.

Several recent studies showed that TERT core promoter mutations occur in melanoma and other cancers[17-19].We wanted to determine whether TERT corepromoter mutations occur in BCSCs.We collected freshly isolated bladder cancer specimens from sixty patients (Supplementary Table 1).We sorted BCSCs and non-BCSCs from bladder tumor tissues through flow cytometry with CD44 (Figure 1A). Simultaneously, NBBCs and non-NBBCs were isolated from adjacent bladder normal tissues with the same surface marker. Cellular morphology of BCSCs，non-BCSCs，NBBCs and non-NBBCs were prepared by cytospinning followed by Giemsa-Wright staining (Figure 1B).BCSCs and NBBCs possessed a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio,relatively smaller and homogenous in size.The morphology of BCSCs was similar to that of NBBCs. In contrast,non-BCSCswere characterized by tumorous features (Figure 1B).Non-NBBCs were characteristic of differentiated cells.Moreover, CK5 was stained positive on BCSCs (Figure 1C).BCSCs exhibited significantly higher oncosphere-forming efficiency compared with nonBCSCs (Figure 1D).

Thus, the TERT promoter mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity. We examined TERT expression and telomerase activity in all sorted bladder cancer samples by real-time PCR and TRAP (telomeric repeat sequence amplification protocol) assays.We observed that TERT mRNA levels in BCSCs were much higher than in non-BCSCs (Figure 3B),while TERT mRNA remained low expression in NBBCs and non-NBBCs.

ETS1 gene belongs to a member of the ETS transcription factor family.To determine whether the $\\mathrm { C } 2 2 8 \\mathrm { T }$ mutation of TERT promoter binds to ETS1，we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) with an antibody against ETS1 from nuclear extracts of all sorted samples.We observed that anti-ETS1 antibody could enrich the TERT promoter in BCSCs (Figure 3G),but no enrichment in non-BCSCs,NBBCs or non-NBBCs. However,BCSCs(T228C) abolishedthebinding capacity (Figure 3G).Importantly，NBBCs(C228T) could enrich the TERT promoter to ETS1 gene.In summary, ETS1 was enriched to the TERT promoter in BCSCs and in NBBCs(C228T),which may contribute to TERT expression leading to telomerase activation. TERT was reported to be implicated in initiation and self-renewal of cancer stem cells [19].How TERT is involved in modulation of BCSC maintenance remains to be further investigated. ",

Because tumors showed heterogeneous staining, the dominant pattern was used for scoring. The scores indicating percentage of positive tumor cells and staining intensity were multiplied to produce a weighed score for each case.Caseswith weighed scores $< 1$ were defined as negative; cases with weighed scores $> 2$ were defined as stronglypositive and those in between were defined as positive.We detected bladder tumor tissues from biopsies with classification of Grade (G1-3） and Stage (T1-4) among 319 bladder cancer patients.Low grades G1-G2 and low stages Ta-T1 were weakly stained (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table 4). Severe patients with high grade G3 and high stages T3-T4 showed intense staining of TERT.Normal bladder tissues were not stained as a negative control. The expression levels of TERT epitope correlated with pathological grades and tumor stages of bladder cancers. ",

Thus C228T mutation performs as a onco-promoter for bladder cancer. This result also indicated the potential origination of BSCS from mutated NBBC,which needs further investigation.Moreover, T228C mutation in BSCS can restore the normal TERT expression and abolish its tumor initiating capacity greatly. The TERT promoter acts as a gatekeeper controlling the transition between NBBC and BCSC.Collectively，the C228T mutation in TERT promoter may act as a driver to initiate bladder tumorigenesis from NBBC.In order to confirm this conclusion，genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) should be employed in future study.
