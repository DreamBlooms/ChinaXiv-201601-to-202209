Here we demonstrated that PS341 negativelyregulated HCCand CRCboth in vitro and in vivo, including the inhibition of cellproliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),the expression of stemness-related genes,cell migration and invasiveness.Mechanically, PS341 upregulated the expression of FOXO3,which inhibited the transcriptional activation of CTNNB1.The downregualtionofCTNNB1 led to apoptosis,cellcycle arrest, and the inhibition of migration,invasion,self-renewal and tumor formation of these two cancer types. In sum,ourfindings shed lighton the PS341 mediated targeted therapy against both HCC and CRC in the future. ",

Meanwhile,the expression ofFOXO3 remained unchanged between former two groups (Fig.6g). Taken together, PS341 enhanced the expressionofFOXO3 in mRNA and protein levels in HCCand CRC cels,in which FOXO3 could bind to the promoter of CTNNB1 and suppressed the expression of CTNNB1. ",
