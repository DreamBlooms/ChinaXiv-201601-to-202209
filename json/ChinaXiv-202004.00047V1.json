        "text": "Abstract: The Chinese Loess Plateau is known as one of the most severe soil erosion regions in the world. Two ecological restoration projects,i.e., the integrated soil conservation project since the 197Os and the \"Grain for Green\" project since 1999, have been progressively implemented to control the soil erosion in this area.Ecological restoration has greatly changed flow regime over the past five decades. However, the mechanism of how flow regime responds to ecological restoration among landforms remains poorly understood.In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of flow regime in three catchments,i.e., Wuqi,Honghe and Huangling hydrological stations, respectively representing the loess hill-guly, loess table-gully and rocky mountain (covered by secondary forest) areas in the Chinese Loess Plateau, using daily hydrological data during the 196Os-2010s.The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, Petit's testand daily flow series were used to investigate the changes of flow regime. Significantly negative trends of annual streamflow were detected at the Wuqi and Honghe stations, except for the Huangling station. The annual baseflow at the Wuqi station showed a significantly positive trend whereas a significantly negative trend was observed at the Honghe station,and there was no significant trend at the Huangling station. It was interesting that baseflow index significantly increased during the whole period in all catchments. However,the trends and change points of daily flow series derived by different percentages of exceedance and extreme series in different consecutive days varied among individuals.Based on the change points analysis of annual streamflow, we divided data series into three periods,i.e.,the baseline period (from 1959 and 1963 to 1979,PI),the integrated soil conservation period (1980-1999,PI) and the \"Grain for Green\" period (2000-2011,PII).We found that streamflow decreased due to the reduction of high streamflow (exceeding $5 \\%$ of time within a year) and median streamflow $( 5 0 \\% )$ in PII and PIII at the Wuqi and Honghe stations. However, low flow $( 9 5 \\% )$ increased in PII and PII at the Wuqi station while decreased at the Honghe station. Streamflow change at the Huangling station was more stable,thus potentially resulting in much less soil erosion in the forestry area than in the other areas.The great improvement in ecological environment on the Chinese Loess Plateau revealed the advantages of ecological restoration in reducing flood amount and compensating streamflow at a regional scale.

        "text": "The Chinese Loess Plateau (LP),characterized by a fragmented landscape and severe soil erosion and located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin, is an important agricultural area. Sediment yields in several drainage basins on the LP ranged from $3 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ to $4 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 4 } ~ \\mathrm { t } / ( \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { a } )$ over recent decades (Shi and Shao,2OOO). Soil erosion has resulted in the loss of soil nutrients and agricultural land, which is detrimental to local ecological security and social economic development. To ensure ecological security, Chinese government had implemented the integrated soil conservation project since the 197Os to control soil erosion and increase water supply. The project included constructions of terraces and sediment-trapping dams， afforestation and vegetation cover improvement. These engineering measures significantly and immediately increased streamflow, weakened the magnitudes and peaks of high flow and decreased sediment deposition (Xu et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2011). Approximately $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ sediment-trapping dams were built before the end of the 198Os.However, these engineering measures will slowly lose their effectiveness and eventually be abandoned due to deposition (Ran et al., 2O13; Zhang et al., 2017).The \"Grain for Green\" project initiated by the Chinese government in 1999 has been widely adopted to improve vegetation cover in China. Studies showed that the LP was experiencing a reduction in precipitation with increasing climate warming. The loess landform is the result of the combined action of running water forces and human activities, which afects the runoff process (Zhang et al.,2008; Zhao et al.,2014; Ma et al.,2015; Yuan et al.,2015; Zhang et al., 2017).

        "text": "Recently, many studies have found that increases in percentage of area treated by ecological restoration have resulted in streamflow reduction in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin (Zhao et al., 2O13; Zhao et al.,2014). However, it is not clear how hydrological regime changed with the implementation of ecological restoration. Although streamflow has significantly decreased on a large scale,the mechanism of how streamflow change in the context of ecological restoration remains in debate (Shi and Shao,20OO; Zhang et al.,2008; Zhao et al.,2010; Gao et al.,2012; Zhang and Wei,2012; Zhao et al., 2014;Ma et al.，2015; Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, how streamflow responds to ecological restoration among drainage areas with different landforms is still unclear. To evaluate the role of \"Grain for Green\" project since 1999 in streamflow,we selected three catchments respectively representing loess hilly-gully, table-gully and rocky mountain to investigate the changes of flow regime in the integrated soil conservation period and the \"Grain for Green\" period.

The Beiluo River is characterized by high-intensity rainstorms,a fragmented landscape,crisscrossing galleys and steep slopes.This area is one of the main source areas of coarse sediment in the Yellow River basin.To control severe soil erosion, people adopted a series of soil conservation measures in this area since the 1950s.In 1999,in response to the \"Grain for Green\" project，environmental construction was conducted in this region.As long-lasting ecological constructions went on,this region has formed secondary forest with deciduous broad-leaved trees,shrub and grasslands (Qin et al.,2OlO).The Juhe River (approximately $2 2 6 6 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ，Huangling station) originates from the Ziwuling Mountains with the landforms of loess hilly-gully and rocky mountain. The catchment is covered by natural secondary forest (canopy closure of $8 0 \\%$ ),and forest structure is basically formed by trees,shrubs and herbs.The Honghe River (approximately $1 2 7 2 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ ,Honghe station) is located in the loess table-gully region. The topography in this catchment is mainly composed by plateau,ditch slope and valley.The landform in this area is characterized by flat terrain with a gentle slope,fertile soils,and mainly farmed crops. The ditch slope is the buffer zone that connects the plateau,with a slope between $7 ^ { \\circ }$ and $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ，most of which is pasture. The valley below the ditch slope has a \"V\" shape,with a slope of greater than $2 5 ^ { \\circ }$ Soil conservation measures started in the 1950s (Zhang et al.,2010; Gao et al.,2012; Ran et al., 2013; Du et al.,2014; Zhao et al., 2014).

The time spent for baseflow response to ecological restoration was longer than that of streamflow at the Wuqi station. The change point of streamflow and baseflow caused by ecological restoration from 1999 may not have appeared yet at the Honghe station. Scott and Smith (1997) reported that response time of catchment was dependent on the extent of vegetation change,the rate of tree growth,the area of ecological restoration, mean annual precipitation, soil permeability property and the other characteristics. Increased infiltration by ecological restoration can recharge to the groundwater system, resulting in a shorter response time. This viewpoint showed that vegetation effects on flow reduction will be efficient only if accumulated vegetation coverage exceeds a critical value approximately $2 0 . 0 0 \\%$ (Cai，2OO1). The percentage of artificial vegetation (afforestation and pasture） area was $4 . 7 5 \\%$ in 1979 but increased to $2 3 . 2 0 \\%$ in 2002 in the catchment of the Wuqi station. However, artificial vegetation only increased from $5 . 2 2 \\%$ in 1984 to $12 . 8 3 \\%$ in 1999 at the Honghe River.

For instance,a large number of sediment-trapping dams,with an area percentage much less than $2 0 . 0 0 \\%$ , had led to the decrease of streamflow by more than $3 0 . 0 0 \\%$ in some areas of the Yelow River (Xu et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2011; Moghadam et al.,2015). It was reported that approximately more than $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ sediment-trapping dams and reservoirs were built in the 197Os in the Chinese Loess Plateau. Obviously,the abrupt change point in streamflow and baseflow related to the construction of engineering measures in the 197Os. Our results showed that response of streamflow and baseflow in different landforms to ecological restoration were different from each other.This result might be due to the gradual change under the impact of soil and water conservation in different catchments.As cumulative area of the conservation measures increased， the characteristics of flow regime were changed. The small-scale implementation of the soil and water conservation measures in PI had an effect on streamflow and baseflow moderation, which was weaker than that in PII. With the rapid increasing of area treated by ecological restoration,flow regime changes significantly occurred in the 199Os and at the beginning of the $2 1 ^ { \\mathrm { s t } }$ century. Although change points also happened in the 198Os,streamflow and baseflow were further regulated in PIII (Table 7). At last, ecological restoration reduced surface runoff generation but increasing infiltration,and water recharge therefore increased baseflow (Zhang et al.,2008; Nie et al.,2011; Nian et al.,2014; Moghadam et al.,2015; Yuan et al.,2015; Zhang et al., 2017).

However, the trends of annual baseflow,daily flow with different percentage exceedances and extrema series in different consecutive days were different in the two catchments. The rates of streamflow change mainly depends on human activity intensity,including the percentage of area treated by soil and water conservation measures and the functional promotion of vegetation community (Wang et al.,2013; Zhao et al.,2014; Zhang et al.,2017). The types of landform also influences streamflow regime to a certain extent, as topography,unsaturated zone and aquifer medium affect rainfall infiltration and water recharge.As shown in Table 2,BFI in the loess table-gully region was larger than that in the loess hilly-gully region before 1969.To our knowledge, in comparison with the deep gully dominated landform in the loess hilly-gully region, the flat loess table is beneficial to rainfallinfiltration and thus to formulate a high baseflow depth in a long history.

In detail, the cumulative area treated and vegetation cover accounted for $3 6 . 4 \\%$ and $3 4 . 2 \\%$ of the total area at the Wuqi station,and accounted for $3 8 . 5 \\%$ and $4 2 . 4 \\%$ at the Honghe station, respectively (Xu,1998; Shi etal.,2002; Zhang et al.,2010). The surface coverage changes reduced the conversion of precipitation into streamflow and increased soil water storage，which would change hydrological processes (Zhang et al.,2O18). Ecological restoration effectively regulated the daily streamflow, increased streamflow in dry season, and eventually increased baseflow at various frequencies at the Wuqi station.However,such an effect has not yet occurred at the Honghe station. On one hand,this finding may be come from the reason that it needs many years for the water recharge of the increased infiltration because of the thick soil layer (with a thickness of $5 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ ；Wang et al.,2O13). On the other hand,it comes from the difference in combination of ecological restoration. Wuqi station is located in the forest steppe and is a typical steppe zone. Apart from reforestation by returning cultivated land, vegetation type of natural vegetation restoration mainly constitutes by shrub grassland. Honghe station is located in the forest zone,and reforestation is the main ecological restoration. Generall,an increased forest cover can promote the hydrological cycle,and there is less streamflow and larger evaporation in the forest catchment than in the grassland catchment (Gao et al.,2O12; Zhang and Wei,2012; Wang et al.,2O13; Wan et al.,2014; Zhang et al.,2O17). Consequently,high-frequency streamflow and baseflow increased at the Wuqi station but decreased at the Honghe station.Therefore,impacts of ecological restoration and landform comprehensively changed the flow regime in PII. Due to the expansion of the scale and increased heterogeneity, qualitative judgment and quantitative analysis on the regional scale need further investigation. ",

Thus it can be assumed that natural secondary forest with a reasonable community functional composition can maintain a more stable hydrological system, which provides an ecological and hydrological theoretical basis for catchment management in the Chinese Loess Plateau. It was reported that a rainstorm occurred on 30 and 31 August 1994 at the Wuqi and Huangling stations (Qin et al., 2O1O). Although daily precipitation was approximately 82 mm， streamflow was $4 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ at the Wuqi station but only O.O7 at the Huangling station. This phenomenon well explained the assumption above and indicated that natural forest (or reforestation after vegetation successon) could well regulate peak streamflow and recharging flow.

Statistically significant change points in streamflow and baseflow were identified in all stations.Ecological restoration changed flow regime,as the data could be divided into three periods,i.e.,the baseline period from 1959 and 1963 to 1979 (PI),the integrated soil conservation period from 1980 to 1999 (PII) and the \"Grain for Green\" period from 20OO to 2011 (PIII).

        "text": "High streamflow and median streamflow decreased in PII and PII at the Wuqi and Honghe stations.However,low streamflow increased at the Wuqi station but decreased at the Honghe station in PI and PII. Our finding indicates that ecological restoration can moderate flow by lowering high flow and increasing low flow through water recharge. But such a streamflow moderation effect depends on the scientific and technical aspects of the combination of various ecological restoration measures.In other words,human activities determine the changing direction of streamflow in catchments with various landforms.
