The effective assessment of habitat quality can help balance the relationship between economic development and biodiversity conservation.Therefore,this study used the InVEST model to conduct a dynamic evaluation of the spatial and temporal changes in habitat quality of the Tarim River Basin in southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China by calculating the degradation degree levels for habitat types that were caused by threat factors from 1990 to 2018 (represented by four periods of 1990,2000,2010 and 2018). Specifically,we used spatial autocorrelation analysis and Getis-Ord $\\boldsymbol { G } _ { i } ^ { * }$ analysis to divide the study area into three heterogeneous units in terms of habitat quality: cold spot areas,hot spot areas and random areas.Hemeroby index,population density, gross domestic product (GDP),altitude and distance from water source (DWS) were then chosen as the main disturbance factors.Linear correlation and spatial regression models were subsequently used to analyze the influences of disturbance factors on habitat quality. The results demonstrated that the overall level of habitat quality in the TRB was poor, showing a continuous degradation state. The intensity of the negative correlation between habitat quality and Hemeroby index was proven to be strongest in cold spot areas, hot spot areas and random areas. The spatial lag model (SLM) was beter suited to spatial regression analysis due to the spatial dependence of habitat quality and disturbance factors in heterogeneous units. By analyzing the model, Hemeroby index was found to have the greatest impact on habitat quality in the studied four periods (1990,2Oo0,2010 and 2018).The research results have potential guiding significance for the formulation of reasonable management policies in the TRB as well as other river basins in arid areas.

        "text": "Biodiversity is the combination of an organism，complex environment and various related ecological processes and is also the material basis for human survival (Ma et al.,1998).As human activities increase and the economy and society develop rapidly, human disturbance to ecosystems has affected the quality of biological habitats and caused a reduction in biodiversity. According to statistic data (2011-2020),over $1 . 5 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ species have disappeared,and the trend of biodiversity loss has not been efectively curbed; biodiversity is anticipated to decrease further in the future (Isbell et al.,2013; Terrado et al.,2016a; Dai et al.,2018). Habitat quality is the ability of an ecosystem to provide suitable living conditions for the sustainable development of individuals and populations within a certain space-time range,which reflects regional biodiversity status to a certain extent (Fellman et al.， 2015;Hillard et al.，2O15). Therefore,the exploration of the changes in regional habitat quality and analysis of the influencing factors of these changes are of great significance for the protection and ecological management of regional biodiversity.

        "text": "Habitat quality is regarded as an important representation of regional biodiversity and ecosystem services,and the assessment, simulation and prediction of its trend and status are an effective means for studying regional ecosystem services (Wu et al., 2O21). Currently, the main methods used for habitat quality assessment include the traditional biodiversity and habitat survey method (Mark et al., 2OO8; Miller et al.,2O1O), ecological index evaluation method (Maes et al., 2012; Coates et al., 2016) and ecological assessment model (Costa et al.,2010; Terrado et al., 2016a,b). Due to a lack of long-term and continuous species detection data in field biodiversity surveys,biodiversity and habitat survey methods cannot be used to evaluate the temporal and spatial dynamic changes in biodiversity (Balasooriya et al.， 2008； Sun et al.，2010).For calculation, the ecological index evaluation method uses the habitat quality evaluation index system and evaluation criteria, such as the biological abundance index and vegetation coverage, which have certain defects in terms of the evaluation of dynamic changes in habitat quality and its spatial agglomeration state. With the wider application of 3S (geographic information system (GIS),global positioning system (GPS),and remote sensing (RS)) technology and mathematical models,ecological assessment models have become a powerful tool for the quantitative,visual and fine monitoring and assessment of temporal and spatial changes in habitat quality (Leh et al., 2013).Currently,the main ecological assessment models include the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model (Liu et al.,2OO6), Social Value for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) model (Sherrouse et al.，2O14） and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST） model (Sharp et al., 2016;Aneseyee et al., 202O). Of these,the InVEST model has the advantages of having relatively few operation parameters，easily accessing to basic data and providing quantifiable assessment results and spatial visualization; the model is widely used for studying habitat quality， particularly in large-scale basins or regions. For example,Chu et al. (2018) combined an InVEST model and Cellular Automaton (CA)-Markov method to study the evolution of landscape patterns and habitat quality in the Hubei section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area in China. Their results demonstrated that habitat degradation and landscape patern change are causing the continuous decline of biodiversity in the region. Aneseyee et al. (2O2O) used the InVEST model to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in habitat quality of diferent land use types in the Winike Basin (in the Omo-Gibe Basin，Southwest Ethiopia） and discussed the influence of population density, altitude,land use intensity and other factors on habitat quality.

Most previous studies have focused on the impact of land use and spatial patern change on regional habitat quality (e.g., Zheng et al., 2O18). Researchers have generally directly associated land use change with habitat quality models when studying the impact of land use change on habitat quality (Chu et al., 2018; Wang et al.,， 2O19;Wang et al.,2O2O). Studies have also focused on analyzing the correlation between habitat quality and natural and anthropogenic factors, including altitude, slope, GDP and intensity of land use,as a means of quantifying the impact of different disturbance factors on habitat quality (Sun et al.，2O19). However, relatively few studies have been conducted on the relationship between the comprehensive indicators of human disturbance and habitat quality. ",

        "text": "The Tarim River Basin (TRB） is located in southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. It is a typical inland arid area and also an important area in terms of landscape biodiversity protection. The region has an abundance of natural resources and plays a crucial role in strategic development, but it has a fragile ecological environment (Xue et al., 2O19). The geographic components of vegetation found in the TRB include desert vegetation flora. Plant species are relatively poor, mainly including Populus euphratica, Tamarix chinensis, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Phragmites communis. The desert riparian forest with Populus euphratica and Tamarix sp. as constructive and dominant species is the main barrier for the desertification of oases (Yu et al., 2017). In recent decades, as a result of increased human activities, social activities and economic activities,the unreasonable development and utilization of water and soil resources in the TRB have caused several ecological and environmental problems (vegetation degradation， lake drought, desertification, massive loss of biodiversity and habitat degradation) (Tan et al.,2011; Ling et al.,2Ol8).Following the implementation of the Belt and Road initiative,as the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt (Chen et al.,2O16),the habitat quality of the TRB is of great significance in terms of social and economic development, ecosystem balance and biodiversity protection. However， most existing researches on the TRB have focused on climate change, optimization of the allocation of water resources,land use change and ecological water transfer effects，whereas comparatively little research was focused on biodiversity from an ecosystem service perspective.

The habitat quality module reflects the impact of human activities on the ecological environment; therefore,the greater the disturbance of human activities is,the greater the threat to the habitat, and the lower the quality is,the lower the biodiversity. Habitat type and threat source factors must be set when the habitat quality module is running (Zhang et al.，2O11).Due to the different sensitivities of various land use types to threat source factors (Yang et al.,2O18),the current situation and expert opinions of the TRB were considered in this study,and cultivated land, construction land and unused land were chosen as threat source factors. The other land use types (forestland, grassland and water body) represent different habitat types. After referring to the user manual for the InVEST model and examining previous research results (Zhang et al., 2O11; Liu et al.，2020; Wang et al.，2O21)，we then determined the weight of threat source factors,the maximum influence distance of source factors on ecological land (Table 1) and the sensitivity of ecological land to stress factors (Table 2).The core objective of the habitat quality module is to establish the relationship between habitat types and threat source factors or to obtain the degradation degree of habitat by calculating the negative impact of threat source factors on the habitat and then determining the habitat quality based on the suitability and degradation degree of habitat.

In ArcGIS,habitat quality values were divided into four grades: 0.0000-0.2500, 0.2500-0.5000, 0.5000-0.7500 and 0.7500-1.0000.The smaller the value was, the worse the habitat quality.Figure 3 shows that the overall level of habitat quality for the entire TRB was poor (in the range of O.25O0-0.5ooO),and the average habitat quality continued to decrease from 0.3000 in 1990 to 0.2700 in 2018,which indicated that habitat quality in the study area was in a state of degradation. Between 199O and 2O18,habitat quality in each sub-basin exhibited different degrees of degradation (with the exception of the Hotan River Basin (HRB)). The spatial distribution of habitat quality demonstrated that there were differences in habitat quality between sub-basins in the study area (Tables 4 and 5).Habitat quality of the northern sub-basins (Kaxgar River Basin (KRB1),Aksu River Basin (ARB), Weigan River Basin (WRB) and Kaidu-Konqi River Basin (KRB3） was higher than that of the southern sub-basins (HRB, Keriya River Basin (KRB2)，and Cherchen River Basin (CRB))，and habitat quality of high-altitude areas (gradient 3(30oO-45OO m) and gradient 4 $( 4 5 0 0 - 8 4 3 9 \\mathrm { m } )$ ; Table5)was higher than that of low-altitude areas (gradient 1 $( 4 1 - 1 5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m } )$ and gradient2( $1 5 0 0 { - } 3 0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m } )$ ; Table 5). The spatial differences of habitat quality between 1990 and 2018 were obvious.

        "text": "Results in Section 3.3 showed that from 1990 to 2018, Hemeroby index in the TRB displayed an increasing trend, and habitat quality was in a state of degradation. As the premise and foundation of ecosystem service functions,habitat quality has a number of disturbance factors (Fellman et al.,2015; Hillard et al., 2015; Han et al.,2O2O). Hemeroby index is a comprehensive indicator of human disturbance and reflects the disturbance degree of landscape type (or land use type) change on an ecological environment. Therefore, during the analysis of habitat quality and disturbance factors,it is also necessary to consider other natural and human factors,in addition to the availability of data.Relevant studies (Sun et al., 2O19; Aneseyee et al.,2O2O) have shown that population density, socioeconomic factors,topography and geomorphology have impacts on the distribution of habitat quality. The water system structure of the TRB is separate,and \"water is oasis, no water is desert\" is the typical characteristic of the basin. Water plays a crucial role in the ecological environment of the basin (particularly the mainstream of the Tarim River). Based on the above characteristics, this study chose Hemeroby index, population density, GDP, altitude and distance from water source (DWS) as the main disturbance factors. The above five variables were diagnosed using collinearity (Fig.7),and the results demonstrated that the variance inflation factor(VIF） values for each disturbance factor in different years were less than 5.O,which indicated that there was no collinearity between the factors.

Habitat quality showed a positive linear relationship with population density and GDP in cold spot areas and random areas and a significant and negative linear relationship in hot spot areas,which indicated that population density and GDP facilitated habitat quality degradation in hot spot areas but not in cold spot areas and random areas.The reason for this difference is that hot spot areas were the main population gathering regions with frequent human activities,which can directly or indirectly affect the habitat.

The range of $R ^ { 2 }$ values was $0 . 0 0 0 0 { - } 1 . 0 0 0 0$ ，and the closer the $R ^ { 2 }$ values were to 1.Oooo,the better the regression effect of the spatial regression model.

According to the OLS, it was necessary to judge the significance of the Lagrange multiplier (LM) and Robust lagrange multiplier (RLM). The larger the values of the two were, the beter the regression effect of the spatial regression model. Table 7 shows that the global Moran's $I$ (error） values of the three heterogeneous units between 199O and 2O18 were significant at $P { < } 0 . 0 1$ level,which indicated that there was a spatial dependence in all spatial regressions. Furthermore,LM (lag) and LM(error) all passed the significance test of $1 \\%$ . Therefore,SEM or SLM regression was beter suited to the study of habitat quality and disturbance factors than the OLS regression. The regression model with the best fitting effect was chosen following a comparison between the LM and RLM values of the three heterogeneous units for each year. By examining the advantages and disadvantages,the SLM was deemed to be more suitable for the spatial regression analysis. ",

Habitat quality was also generally better in the northern region of the study area than in the southern region and in high-altitude areas than in low-altitude areas. This could be because there was a greater vegetation coverage in the northern region than in the southern region and the frequency of human activities in high-altitude areas was lower. These results were consistent with those obtained by Liu et al. (2O2O) on the spatial and temporal changes in habitat quality in Xinjiang of China: the overall habitat quality in Xinjiang displayed a degradation trend,and the areas with high values of habitat quality were mainly located at the edge of mountains and basins (Liu et al., 2O2O). At the same time, the results of our study were also similar to those obtained by research on the landscape biodiversity of the YRB in the TRB by Huang et al. (2O2O): areas with low values of habitat quality were mainly distributed in regions with a poor natural environment and areas with high values of habitat quality were mainly distributed in natural forests and grassland reserves (Huang et al.，2O2O). Our study also confirmed that there was a significant spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality of the TRB,and the study area can be divided into three heterogeneous units in terms of habitat quality: cold spot areas,hot spot areas and random areas (Fig.5). In the three heterogeneous units,cold spot areas were mainly concentrated in low-altitude areas, which were the main regions of human activities, in addition to the two large deserts (Taklamakan Desert and Kumtag Desert). Hot spot areas were mainly distributed in high-altitude mountainous regions or ecological protection regions,as these areas had relatively high vegetation coverage. ",

Among other disturbance factors, population density and GDP exhibited opposite correlations in cold spot areas,random areas and hot spot areas.

In recent years,as a function module of the InVEST model, habitat quality assessment has been widely conducted (Sharp et al., 2016; Babbar et al., 2021). However, the model has some shortcomings when assessing habitat quality. For example,it obtains the habitat quality in a study area by accumulating the influence of threat source factors on habitat quality,but the simple accumulation of threat source factors is not exactly equal to the comprehensive impact of these stress factors. Therefore, the model requires further improvement in terms of the usage process.

Spatially, habitat quality in the northern region was greater than that in the southern region and greater in high-altitude areas than in low-altitude areas.The results showed that habitat quality exhibited spatial heterogeneity in the TRB,represented by cold spot areas, hot spot areas and random areas. There was a significant negative linear relationship between habitat quality and Hemeroby index in the three heterogeneous units,and the correlation coefficient was greater than the correlation coefficients of habitat quality with population density, GDP, altitude and DWS. There was a spatial dependence between habitat quality and disturbance factors in the three heterogeneous units. During the four periods (1990,2000,2010 and 2018), habitat quality in each heterogeneous unit had a significant and negative correlation with Hemeroby index, altitude and DWS,but the correlation coefficient with Hemeroby index was the largest, which indicated that Hemeroby index had the greatest impact on habitat quality.
