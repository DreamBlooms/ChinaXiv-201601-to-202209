However, it remains unclear to what extent individual difference in justice sensitivity is influenced by genetic versus environmental factors. Using a sample with 244 twin pairs, the present research was an attempt to determine what extent genetic factor plays a role in the inter-individual difference of justice sensitivity as well as whether different facets of justice sensitivity， namely， proself and prosocial perspective, share common genetic basis. Results showed that (1) all the four facets of justice sensitivity were moderately heritable $( 2 1 \\% - 3 3 \\% )$ ） and that the non-shared environmental factors accounted for the rest variations $( 6 7 \\% - 7 9 \\% )$ ； (2) associations between the prosocial facets of justice sensitivity were driven by common genetics ( $\\mathbf { \\tilde { r } _ { g } }$ .50-.65) and non-shared environmental (re: .24-.65) influences,whereas no strong evidence supported a genetic correlation between proself and prosocial justice sensitivity. The current findings provide novel evidence that sensitivity to injustice, especially to others’ suffering,is fundamentally grounded upon genetic origin, thus shedding light on the nature and nurture aspects of justice behavior.

Given justice matters to all people (Schmitt, Baumert, Gollwitzer, & Maes, 2010), and they are sensitive in reaction to the situations when themselves or others are treated unfairly (Baumert & Schmitt, 2016; Schmitt, 1996; Schmitt & Mohiyeddini, 1996; Schmitt, Neumann,& Montada, 1995). Justice sensitivity is essential for mental health and subjective well-being of individuals (Baumert & Schmitt, 2016). Moreover, justice sensitivity has been taken as a potential factor for the emergence and maintenance of psychiatric disorders which have heritable origins in etiology, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Bondu & Elsner, 2O15), depression (Bondu, Sahyazici-Knaak,& Esser, 2O17),and borderline personality disorder (Lis et al., 2018).

In the current work, our interest lies in to assess to what extent genetic factor plays a role in the inter-individual difference of justice sensitivity as well as whether different facets of justice sensitivity, namely, for oneself and for others, share common innate and genetic mechanisms.

        "text": "Recent theories assume that justice sensitivity involves a low perceptual threshold for incidents of injustice, strong emotional responses to injustice (anger, outrage，and guilt)， tendency to ruminate about injustice， and a motivation to reestablish justice (Schmitt et al.， 2Oo5). Justice sensitivity divides the concern for justice into four facets according to the role a person plays in an unjust situation, namely, as the victim, observer or bystander, passive beneficiary, or active perpetrator (Mikula, Petri,& Tanzer, 199O). The victim is the person who feels unjustly treated, the observer is the one who perceives the incident without being directly involved, the beneficiary is the person who receives the benefit passively,and the perpetrator is the one who committed the critical action (Gollwitzer, Schmitt, Schalke, Maes,& Baer, 2005).On the one hand, these four facets of justice sensitivity can be further distinguished as justice concerns for the self and for others, such that victim sensitivity (VS） involves proself concerns for one's own interest, whereas observer sensitivity (OS), beneficiary sensitivity (BS), and perpetrator sensitivity (PS) involve prosocial concerns for others and public wellbeing. VS is a mixture of self-related concerns and sense of justice，and the remaining three facets have no selfish component but indicate prosocial and genuine justice concerns (Thomas, Baumert, & Schmitt，2011). On the other hand, the four facets of justice sensitivity appear to overlap,with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.3 to O.8 (Schmitt et al., 2010), because they share the concern for justice as a common element. Regarding the characteristic emotional responses to injustice,BS and PS share a clear similarity in terms of guilty reactions, whereas VS and OS induce outward-focused emotions, such as anger and moral outrage, respectively (Thomas et al.， 2O1l; for a review, see Baumert & Schmitt, 2016).

By contrast, the prosocial facets (OS，BS,and PS） are primarily associated with others-related concerns, such as agreeableness，role taking，empathy, and social responsibility (Schmitt et al., 2010; Schmitt et al., 2005). For behavioral consequences, OS,BS,and PS positively correlate with positive behavioral reciprocity and negatively with negative behavioral reciprocity. VS negatively correlates with positive behavioral reciprocity and positively correlates with negative behavioral reciprocity (Baumert et al., 2014). In particular, people with high (vs. low) OS contribute more to the public good regardless of past exploitation (Gollwitzer, Rothmund, Pfeiffer,& Ensenbach, 2009). Finally, for cultural values, recent cross-cultural studies reveal that variations in the prosocial facets of justice sensitivity have a stable relation with collectivism not only at the country-level but also at the individual level (Maltese et al.,2O18; Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2020).

        "text": "Developmental psychology and behavioral genetics suggest that human nature or genetic factors partly contribute to the individual differences in justice sensitivity. Development studies found that children as young as two years demonstrated preferences for fairness in ultimatum games (Li, Wang, Yu,& Zhu, 2016). A general predisposition towards just evaluations were also observed in 6- and 1O-month-old infants who chose and looked longer at an individual who helped another than at one who hindered another (Hamlin，Wynn,& Bloom， 2007；Warneken & Tomasello, 2006). Previous observational research suggested that animals also respond negatively to inequity. For example, chimpanzees responded with temper tantrums if they did not obtain what they desire, social canids refused to play with individuals who violated social rules,and ravens showed third party intervention against norm violations (Brosnan, 20o6; Brosnan & De Waal, 2003). In summary, the appearance of fairness preference in the early stages of life and the inequity response in animals suggest that the intuitive reaction to injustice has deep biological roots. Behavioral genetics studies on twins further suggest that genes moderately influence the fairness-related decisionmaking behavior (Wallace et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2O19) and morality related traits, such as honesty-humility (Kandler, Richter, & Zapko-Willmes, 2019).

In addition， compared with Western Germans (Capitalism-oriented), Eastern Germans (Socialism-oriented) showed higher levels of all facets of justice sensitivity (Schmitt et al., 2O1O). People in collectivist cultures, such as the Chinese, revealed high BS and comparable OS when compared with individualist Germans, Russians,and North Americans (Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al.， 202O). Moreover， individualsexperimentally primed by collectivist (vs. individualistic） unscrambled-sentence tasks scored high on interdependent self (vs. independent self) and on all three prosocial facets of justice sensitivity (Wu et al., 2020).Similarly, on prosocial facets of justice sensitivity, the collectivist Filipinos scored higher than the individualist Australians (Maltese et al., 2018).

Theoretically, genetic and environmental factors are both considered to account for the inter-individual differences in personality and behaviors, producing the diversities and uniformities of human nature. However, it is unknown to which extent genetic and environmental factors contribute to the inter-individual differences in justice sensitivity. Besides， given that justice sensitivity consists of four components and they are positively correlated between each other, it is unknown whether there are common genetic or environmental factors influences the phenotypic correlations between different perspective of justice sensitivity. Therefore, empirical investigation on the extent that nature and nurture contribute to the course of human development in justice sensitivity is still necessary. ",

First, we investigate to what extent genetic and environmental factors play a role in the interindividual difference of justice sensitivity. Second, we investigate whether different perspective of justice sensitivity shares the common genetic or environmental factors in terms of justice for self and for others. Behavioral genetic work,which is fundamentally about the study of human variation, could provide important clues as to the sources of individual differences (Plomin, DeFries, Knopik,& Neiderhiser, 2013). Specifically， the twin methodology can be used to identify the extent to which individual differences in justice sensitivity are influenced by geneticand environmental factors and to further examine the pairwise genetic and environmental correlations between multiple variables. Therefore, a twin study was conducted to examine the genetic and environmental bases of justice sensitivity and the genetic and environmental associations between different facets of justice sensitivity.

Both AIC and BIC are useful in model selection,with low values indicating better fit than high values. In model selection, Raftery (1993) suggested that a BIC difference of 5 indicates “strong evidence” that one model is superior to another, whereas a difference of 1O indicates “conclusive evidence” (Raftery， 1993).

From an early age， individuals are motivated by considerations of justice such as fairness and equity for both themselves and for others. Despite robust evidence that the desire for justice may be universal, numerous studies have revealed that individuals differ in their reactions to injustices, especially from different perspectives. Hypersensitivity to injustice has been proposed to contribute to the emergence and maintenance of several most common mental disorders (Bondu & Elsner, 2015; Bondui, Sahyazici-Knaak,& Esser, 2017; Lis et al., 2018).With such consideration, we examined the genetic contribution to justice sensitivity variations and the genetic associations between different facets of justice sensitivity using twins. The current results identified modest genetic contributions （204号 $( 2 1 \\% - 3 3 \\% )$ and large non-shared environmental contributions $( 6 7 \\% - 7 9 \\% )$ to justice sensitivity. The shared environmental contribution to justice sensitivity was minimal. More importantly, moderate genetic (.5O-.65） and non-shared environmental (.24-.65) correlations were found among the prosocial facets of justice sensitivity (OS,BS,and PS)，whereas no strong evidence supported a genetic correlation between proself and prosocial justice sensitivity. These findings thus provide novel evidence about the genetic basis of justice sensitivity and the associations between different facets of prosocial of justice sensitivity. ",

In the current study, the identified heritability of justice sensitivity shows implications for understanding individual differences in sensitivity to injustice. Individuals differ in how readily they perceive and how strongly they react to injustice. Several systematic examinations focused on individual differences in the emotions and behaviors that result from experiencing or witnessing injustice (Baumert & Schmitt, 2016; Schmitt, 1996; Schmitt et al., 2010; Schmitt et al., 2005). On the basis of such previous investigations, the present study moves a step forward by conducting a behavioral genetics study on twins and finds moderate justice sensitivity heritability and large non-shared environmental influence for all facets of justice sensitivity. These findings provide novel evidence that justice sensitivity is fundamental trait with reliable genetic basis and environmental influences, thereby shedding light on the nature and nurture aspects of justice and morality.

In line with the previous findings, we observed significant correlations for each paired facets of justice sensitivity except for VS and PS. More importantly, the associations between each pair of prosocial justice sensitivity (OS,BS,and PS) were found to be partly due to genetic factors,although non-shared environments likewise play a role. This discovery implies an overlap of the genes and non-shared environments that influence the three facets of prosocial justice sensitivity and provides evidence for the inherent nature behind these links. These findings are consistent with the previous view that individuals with observer, beneficiary, and perpetrator sensitivities share a genuine concern for justice, whereas those with victim sensitivity have self-related concerns (Thomas et al., 2O11). Based on the self-others distinction of justice sensitivity in terms of personality, behavior, and cultural values (Gollwitzer et al., 2Oo5; Schmitt et al., 2010； Wu et al.， 2011)，our findings provide biological evidence for the homogeneity of prosocial justice sensitivity for others.

        "text": "Furthermore,in the AE models, non-shared environmental factors contribute to all the facets of justice sensitivity more so than genetic factors.For BS and PS, the CE models (shared and non-shared environmental factors） are also workable. These findings suggest that, although genetic factors are significant in explaining the justice sensitivity variations, shared and non-shared environmental factors should likewise be considered. On the one hand,in the twin analysis, non-shared environmental factors are often related to the macro-level societies, such as ecological environment, social structure,and cultural values,all of which play a significant role in the socialization of justice sensitivity. For example, social institutions and cultural values have been found to account for group differences in justice sensitivity among Eastern versus Western Germans (Schmitt et al.， 2O1O),Chinese versus Germans,Russians,and North Americans (Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 202O),and Filipinos versus Australians (Maltese et al., 2018). Even a spontaneous priming of collectivism vs. individualism can promote prosocial justice sensitivity (Wu et al., 2O20). On the other hand, shared environmental factors that are often related to micro-level societies,such as family, were found to be predictable in the CE models of BS $( 2 8 \\% )$ and PS $( 1 7 \\% )$ . Although the family effect on BS and PS has not been tested, a few studies suggested that parenting style (restrictive vs. nurturant) affects the development of inhibition-based moral orientations (Janoff-Bulman, Carnes,& Sheikh, 2O14). Given that BS and PS are inhibition-based (Wu, 2O14), for which people should not take advantage of others (as a beneficiary) or do evil (as perpetrator), further research is necessary to test the effects of restrictive parenting on the development of BS and PS. In addition, a more recent investigation revealed that compared with upper class, low class (indicated by low family income） scored higher on prosocial justice sensitivity, especially for BS and PS (Wu, Wang, Chen,& Zhou, 2020).

        "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the twin participants were young adults. Previous studies found that in comparison， older participants scored significantly higher on justice sensitivity for others and lower on justice sensitivity for self (Schmitt et al., 2010; Wu et al., 202O). Thus, our young adult participants may not be a representative sample of the general population. Second, our study only included a Chinese sample. Recent cross-cultural studies compared justice sensitivity across countries in terms of collectivism-individualism and found that people in collectivist cultures scored higher on prosocial facets than those in individualist cultures (Maltese et al.,2018; Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2020). Thus, our results from the Chinese sample may not necessarily be generalizable to other populations. Third, we used the classic ACE models，which treated genetic, shared and non-shared environmental effects as independent. This ignores the possibility that genetic and environmental factors may correlate or interact with each other in complex ways (Purcell, 2002). Such correlations or interactions are critical for gaining nuanced knowledge about the origins of justice sensitivity. Future investigations might include measures of environments to test for potential interactions or correlations with genes.Lastly, our sample was moderate in size. This entailed wide confidence intervals for model parameters and limited statistical power to detect small genetic or environmental effects，especially shared environmental effects (Verhulst， 2O17). Indeed， the magnitude of several shared environmental effects (Table 2), was below the minimal effect size (.16) that we can detect with sufficient power. Thus, future studies must investigate and further verify the heritability of justice sensitivity by extending the sample size and the scope of participant pools. ",

        "text": "Justice principles play a dominant role in social interaction and justice sensitivity is important for human well-being and mental health. The origin of individual differences in justice sensitivity and the links between different facets of justice sensitivity are still elusive. By using twin methodology, the present study is the first to partition genetic and environmental influences on justice sensitivity across the four facets (VS, OS,BS,and PS) and to comprehensively examine the genetic associations between them. Overall, the results highlight the roles of additive genetic and nonshared environmental factors in shaping individuals’ sensitivity to injustice. Genetic overlaps among prosocial concerns for others are also revealed. As the first genetic study on justice sensitivity, we believe that our findings can shed light on the nature of justice sensitivity and provide additional evidence for understanding proself and prosocial facets of justice sensitivity.
