Plants offer a platform for the production of recombinant proteins,which is cheap and easy to scale up and has a low risk of contamination with human pathogens.TGF- $_ { \\cdot \\beta 3 }$ has been produced in plants before using a chloroplast expression system. However,this strategy requires chemical refolding to obtain a biologically active protein.In this study,we investigated the posibility to transiently express active human TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.We successfully expressed mature TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\beta } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ in the absence of the latency-associated peptide (LAP) using different strategies,but the obtained proteins were inactive. Upon expression of LAP-TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\beta } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ ,we were able to show that processing of the latent complex bya furin-like protease does not occur in planta.The use of a chitinase signal peptide enhanced the expression and secretion of LAP-TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ ,and co-expression of human furin enabled the proteolytic processing of latent TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\beta } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ . Engineering the plant posttranslational machinery by co-expressing human furin also enhanced the accumulation of biologically active TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\beta } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ .This engineering step is quite remarkable,as furin requires multiple processing steps and correct localization within the secretory pathway to become active.Our data demonstrate that plants can be a suitable platform for the production of complex proteins that rely on specific proteolytic processing.

Thus，TGF- $\\beta 1$ might be used as a remedy for patients with (chronic) inflammatory diseases,likearthritis,inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.However,in the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 or IL-6，TGF- $\\cdot \\beta \\lambda$ gives rise to populations of T helper cells that can promote inflammation (Th9 and Th17 cells，respectively)(Dardalhon et al.，2oo8;Veldhoen et al.，2006，2008).TGF-β2 also plays a role in controlling the immune system by inducing oral tolerance and suppressing immune responses.Next to that,TGF-β2 inhibits growth of intestinal epithelial cellsand promotestheirdifferentiation. Therefore，TGF- $\\lvert \\beta 2 \\rvert$ might be effective in treating inflammatory bowel diseases (Oz et al.,2004).A disadvantage of TGF- $\\cdot \\beta 1$ and TGF-β2 is the strong fibrotic response they can elicit.TGF- $\\beta 3$ on the other hand does not induce fibrosis and therefore hasa therapeutic application in scar-free wound healing (O'Kane and Ferguson,1997).

Recently,TGF-β3 has been produced in chloroplasts of Nicotiana tabacum (Gisby et al.，2011).A synthetic gene was used for chloroplast transformationand yielded up to3 mg TGF- $\\beta 3$ per 80 grams of fresh tobacco leaves( $3 7 . 5 ~ \\mu \\ g / \\ g$ leaf).However,because TGF- ${ } \\cdot \\{ \\beta 3 \\$ was expressed in chloroplasts, the protein was not folded correctly due to the many cysteine bridges required for the cysteine knot structure in TGF- $\\cdot \\beta$ .Plant-produced TGF- $\\cdot \\beta 3$ therefore had to be chemically refolded upon purification，thereby losing the plants'economical advantage over bacterial expression systems.

Proteolytic processing is regarded as one of the largest bottlenecks of plant expression systems.A classic example is the unintended processingof antibodies when expressed in plants (De Muynck et al., 2010).A common strategy to increase recombinant protein yield and circumvent proteolytic degradation is to retain the protein in the ER by using a C-terminal KDEL targeting sequence (Schouten et al.,1996).The ER is regarded as a protein friendly environment due to the absence of many proteases.We have used ER retention in order to increase the yield of TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ ，but this strategy did not result in significantly higher yields.As cytokines are inherently unstable,we also attempted to increase the yield of TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ by fusing them to a stable partner.In our study,fusion of TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ to $\\mathsf { F c } \\mathsf {  { \\alpha } }$ increased the yield 16-fold，but led to the production of inactive TGF $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ ．The observation that plantproduced mature TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\beta } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ Or Fcα-TGF $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ is inactive is therefore most likely explained by misfolding of TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\beta } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ in the absence of LAP.This idea is further supported by the fact that we observed a strong difference in the detection of mature TGF $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\beta \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ by ELISA and Western blot.Misfolded TGF- $\\boldsymbol { \\beta } \\boldsymbol { 1 }$ is likely not detected properly in a sandwich ELISA,but might be detected by Western blot under reducing conditions as continuous epitopes become available.
