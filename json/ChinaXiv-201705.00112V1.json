The raw irregular $\\boldsymbol { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles might have been dissolved into the amorphous solid solution since the original particles as well as the coatings gradually transformed into small particles at temperature above $1 2 9 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ [Figs.1(c) and (d)].Besides,the high-energy conversion efficiency of microwave heating method may have contributed to the resulting columnar $\\mathbf { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles.Indeed,contrary to the traditional heating approaches (such as thermal conduction,thermal convection,and thermal radiation),microwave heating takes advantage of the electromagnetic absorption capability of target materials and allows a volumetric heatingin the whole materials. $\\boldsymbol { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ is a kind of conductive material,and can effectively absorb the microwave power through conductive loss mechanism.Meanwhile,the glassy solid solution coating of $Z \\mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ is transparent to the microwave and insulated to heat transfer.Therefore,a sharp temperature gradient might have been built up near the interface of raw $\\boldsymbol { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ particles and coatings.The latter may have provided a driving force for the observed dissolution of $\\mathrm { Z r B } _ { 2 }$ seeds into solid solution.When the concentrations of $Z \\mathrm { r }$ and B are over-saturated,the $\\boldsymbol { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ phase will nucleate and recrystallize from the solid solution [Figs.1(d) and (e)]. Itis believed that the poor microwave absorption and the low thermal conductivity of the glassy coating of $Z \\mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ may have resulted in a moderate evaporation of ${ \\bf B } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ .This may have provided a substantial growth environment for the columnar particles of $\\boldsymbol { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ ： ",

After a longer treating time ( $^ { \\mathrm { ~ \\textit ~ { ~ 1 ~ h ~ } ~ } }$ at $1 3 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ,the diameter of $\\boldsymbol { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ became larger (about $2 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ ）and the aspect ratio of the column crystals was increased to about six [Figs.l(f) and 3(b)].For the columnar crystal growth habit,it is believed that the prismatic crystal plans should possess lower surface energies than the polar surfaces ones( $\\mathrm { Z r }$ -terminated or B-terminated). The total surface energy of the materials system should be at the lowest level if most of hexagonal prismatic plans of $\\mathbf { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ with the $P 6 _ { \\prime }$ /mmm structure are exposed.The glassy solid solution of $Z \\mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ may have provided a suitable environment favoring the atomic diffusion and crystal growth.The hollow tube morphology of $\\mathbf { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ can be well observed in Fig.3(c).This is distinguishable from rod-like morphology reported by previous work.It can be assumed that the selective attachment growth mechanism played the key role during the formation of tubular rod morphology. 11 Actually,in the initial growth stage the tinyrods were assembled into clusters in which they shared the prismatic plans [Fig.l(e)]. This growth habit became more pervasive in the ripened columnar crystals [Fig.3(b)].A careful investigation of the morphology evolution from the nucleation step to the intermediate step then to the final step revealed that $\\mathbf { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ grain growth began in the rim of the raw particles and left the holes inside of assembled rods at the final stage (Figs.1 and 3).The diameter of final columnar crystals was almost same as that of raw particles,which corroborates the proposed tubular crystal formation mechanism by selective attachment.The ragged surface inside the whiskers may be due to the scarce feeding or difficult access of the atoms ( $\\mathrm { \\Delta } Z \\mathrm { r }$ andB) in thisarea[Fig.3(c)].Few columnar crystals deviate from the strictly hexagonal shape [Fig.3(d)], but the angles values of inside walls are close to $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ .This fact means that the formation mechanism still follows the selective attachment of pristine rods along their prismatic planes.As soon as the $\\mathbf { Z } \\mathrm { r } \\mathbf { B } _ { 2 }$ grains nucleate and grow on the surface of $Z \\mathrm { r - B - C - O }$ precursor ceramic particles,they should also be self-heated in the microwave field,which further enhance the growth kinetics of columnar crystals.
