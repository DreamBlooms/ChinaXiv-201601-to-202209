        "text": "Abstract: Since 1996，transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton has been commercially grown in numerous countries in an efort to stem the losses caused by key lepidopteran pests. However, the development of pest resistance to Bt toxins has jeopardized the continued utilization of Bt cotton. As a strategy designed to circumvent the development of resistance, Bt cotton varieties expressing two or more toxins targeting the same pest have been introduced. Nevertheless, from the perspective of long-term planting of Bt cotton, the potential risk of cross-resistance to these Bt toxins is a threat that cannot be ignored. In this paper, we review current research (including that based on the analysis of protein binding sites and resistance genes) on the resistance of cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) to the Bt toxins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab and the interrelationship between these toxins. On the basis of existing evidence, we assume that the actions of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab against coton bollworm are not completely independent, and then propose the \"resistance-associated gene mutation potential hypothesis\". Although the mechanisms underlying the resistance of pests to Bt toxins are yet to be comprehensively elucidated, this hypothesis could undoubtedly have important implications for adopting \"pyramid\" strategy in the future. Further research is recommended to devise strategies to retard the development of $H .$ armigera resistance to Bt cotton, either using different Bt toxins or their various combinations. ",

The long-term extensive use of chemical pesticides to control cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) provided intense selection pressure that resulted in the rapid evolution of resistance to these pesticides, and as a consequence led to an escalation in pesticide application rates (Luttrel et al., 1994; Wu et al., 2005; Tay et al., 2O15; Fleming et al., 2018). This overuse resulted in higher control costs and severe environmental pollution, whereas resistance to the pesticides posed a considerable threat to cotton production (Wu and Guo, 1997, 2005). In an effort to retard or even prevent the development of cotton bollworm resistance to pesticides, cotton was genetically modified to produce insecticidal proteins that would specifically target lepidopteran pests (Sanahuja et al., 2011).

In this regard,however, \"pyramid\", one of the most important management strategies (Sushmita et al., 2016),has emerged as a controversial issue with respect to the potential evolution of cross-resistance to different Bt genes by pests (Luo et al., 20O7; Zhao, 2012; Kain et al., 2015; Tay et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Shabbir et al., 2018). The development of resistance by pests can be achieved via a number of different mechanisms, including modification of Cry toxin receptors，the elimination of toxins from the cytosol, and the development of regulatory mechanisms that disrupt the production of toxin receptors (Melo et al., 2O14). Furthermore, due to the complex nature of biological mechanisms and the heterogeneity of field environments, it is exceedingly difficult to completely clarify the mechanisms underlying the cross-resistance of pests to Bt toxins (Liu et al., 2018).

Lack of refuges, the irrational use of unknown varieties and incomplete routine monitoring programs are among the most probable explanations for the evolution of field resistance (Tabashnik et al., 2OO9a) and pose a considerable threat to the sustainable utilization of Bt cotton (Allah et al., 2009).

Cry2Ab resistance in cotton bollworm could be attributed to three independent resistance-related insertions and deletions in an ATP-binding cassette transporter gene (Tay et al., 2O15). Cadherin proteins may be closely associated with the Cry1Ac resistance of cotton bollworm (Xu, 2005; Yang, 2010). No cross-resistance to CrylAc is observed in isolated Cry2Ab-resistant mutant lines due to differences in the mechanisms of actions of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab (Tay et al., 2015)， and binding site analyses in two Helicoverpa species have accordingly indicated that colonies resistant to Cry2Ab show no cross-resistance to CrylAc. Furthermore, resistant pests with a significantly decreased binding between Cry2Ab toxin and midgut receptors have been found to show no comparable inhibition for CrylAc binding (Caccia et al.,2O1O). Thus, it is postulated that binding site mutation may be responsible for the occurrence of Cry2 protein resistance in Helicoverpa pest species. Conversely， bioassay and binding analyses in cotton bollworm have indicated that lines resistant to CrylAc are susceptible to Cry2Ab, and that there are differences in the binding sites of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab (Luo et al., 2007). Consistently, other research results have suggested that Cry1Ac resistance may not induce a high cross-resistance to Cry2Ab (Tabashnik et al., 2OO2),and bioassay，in vitro labeling and surface plasmon resonance analyses have similarly revealed that there is no brush border membrane vesicle (BBMV) combining competition, and that CrylAc-resistant cotton bollworm shows no cross-resistance to Cry2Ab (Luo, 2O07). By using protein analysis technology， Yin (2012) concluded that Cry2Ab and Cry1Ac have different binding sites on the BBMVs of cotton bollworm based on the excluding micro-effect competition. According to binding site analyses in Ostrinia nubilalis and Spodoptera frugiperda， cross-resistance between proteins (Crylab/ac, CrylA.105 and Cry1Fa) and Cry2A proteins is very unlikely (Hernandez-Rodriguez et al., 2013). In contrast to the aforementioned studies, however， other researchers proposed that many lepidopteran pests, including the cotton bollworm, have developed cross-resistance to CrylAc and Cry2Ab (Yu, 2004; Luo, 2007; Wei et al., 2012, 2015). For example, resistance evaluation in Helicoverpa zea, one of the most important target pests of pyramided Bt cotton, has revealed a low cross-resistance between Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab (Welch et al., 2015).

The findings of previous studies have also showed that dual-toxin Bt cotton expressing CrylAc and Cry2Ab would be more effective in cases that no Bt spray or only CrylAc Bt spray is used, compared with the use of Cry2Ab Bt spray (Wei et al.， 2015). Nevertheless, two cotton bollworm CrylAc-resistant strains collected from fields in northern China were found to have a simultaneous cross-resistance to Cry2Ab (Jin et al., 2013). Other insect pests, including $H .$ zea, have also been found to show a developed cross-resistance to CrylAc and Cry2Ab, thereby markedly reducing the efficacy of the pyramid strategy for pest control (Brevault et al., 2013). For Pectinophora gossypiella, a laboratory Cry2Ab-resistant strain, has been shown to have a high cross-resistance to Cry1Ac; although laboratory CrylAc- and Cry2Ab-resistant strains were found to be able to survive on coton producing CrylAc, they were incapable of surviving on pyramided Bt cotton (Tabashnik et al.， 2009b).

However， these above findings accordingly imply that such cross-resistance might accelerate the development of pest resistance to Bt biological pesticides and pyramided Bt crops (Welch et al.， 2O15). The resistance could conceivably be atributable to the occurrence of resistance to pyramided Bt cotton caused by the screening of one of these toxins that were applied in the field.

Indeed, there is still a general lack of consensus regarding the occurrence of cross-resistance, particularly in the case of cotton bollworm with respect to the two widely used Bt toxins, i.e., Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab (Luo et al., 2007; Zhao, 2012; Welch et al., 2015). A possible explanation forthe disparity among research findings could bethat resistance-associated genes are not confined to a single specific site or a few sites, but involve a diverse range of sites with different genetic mutation potentials. Given this scenario, we propose a new hypothesis, namely， the \"resistance-associated gene mutation potential hypothesis\". Essentially, this hypothesis states that for a specific pest species, including the coton bollworm, genetic mutation associated with the resistance to an environmental stress might occur at many sites based on the differences in resistance mechanisms and biochemical pathways, and that binding sites involved could conceivably have different mutation potentials. When certain resistance-associated sites do not mutate or when mutations that do occur are ineffective in conferring resistance to stress， other resistance-associated sites could mutate with a higher fitness cost, such as higher mortality and longer evolutionary processes. These processes would continue until the population either develops resistance or dwindles to extinction. ",

Accordingly, resistance might evolve in response to changes in any one or a combination of these steps or the associated functional biochemical reactions, including toxin dissolution, enzyme activation, receptor binding and signal transmission.

As a consequence of multi-generation feeding with Cry1Ac, coton bollworm can develop a high resistance to CrylAc but retain a low resistance to Cry2Ab (Wei et al., 2015). However, multi-generation feeding with Cry2Ab resulted in a low resistance to Cry2Ab and a high resistance to CrylAc (Wei et al.， 2015). Furthermore, in heterologous competition assays, CrylAc binding bands were found to be almost unaffected by the addition of 2OO times unlabeled Cry2Ab, whereas all the Cry2Ab bands disappeared in the presence of 2OO times CrylAc competition, thereby indicating significant differences in the binding proteins (Yin, 2012).

However, these conclusions could be more consistent if we take a holistic approach. For instance, certain results indicate that the occurrence of Cry2Ab resistance in cotton bollworm can be attributed to three genetic mutations in an ATP-binding cassete transporter gene, and that there is no cross-resistance to CrylAc in mutant strains as a consequence of differences in the action patterns of CrylAc and Cry2Ab (Tay et al., 2015). However, the results of other studies show that the binding of Cry2Ab to midgut proteins is disrupted in the presence of CrylAc toxin (Yin, 2O12). These apparently contradictory results could be understood from a macro-perspective; specifically, the action of these two toxins is associated with independent resistance-related mutations， whereas they perhaps also have dependent competitive binding sites.

Given the various strands of evidence obtained from the research conducted to date, we can conclude that, with respect to cotton bollworm, the mechanisms of pest resistance to CrylAc and Cry2Ab are not completely independent.
