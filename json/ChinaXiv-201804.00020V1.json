        "text": "Abstract: Film mulching system is a widely employed agricultural practice worldwide. However, the effects of different planting and mulching patterns on soil nutrient content and enzymatic activity have not been well documented. In this study, we examined the impact of four planting and mulching patterns (including control, flat planting without mulching; M1,flat planting with film mulching; M2,ridge-furrow planting with film mulching on both ridges and furrows;and M3,ridge-furrow planting with film mulching on continuous ridges) on the seed yield of winter oilseed rape,soil moisture, soil temperature, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, soil nutrient content, and soil enzymatic activity over three growing seasons from 2O12 to 2015 in a winter oilseed rape field in the semi-arid area of Northwest China. Seed yield of winter oilseed rape，soil moisture，soil temperature，enzymatic activities,and contents of nitrate-nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium were all significantly higher in mulching treatments (M1,M2 and M3) than in control treatment over the three growing seasons, whereas SOC content was significantly lower in mulching treatments than in control treatment during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Among the three mulching treatments (M1，M2 and M3)，the M3 treatment showed consistently higher seed yield,SOC content, nutrient contents,and enzymatic activities than the other two treatments. Seed yield of winter oilseed rape was $41 . 1 \\%$ and $1 5 . 0 \\%$ higher in M3 than in M1 and M2, respectively. SOC content and soil enzymatic activities in the top $\\mathrm { 0 { - } } 2 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layers and nitrate-nitrogen content in the top $\\left. 0 { - } 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m } \\right.$ soil layers were all significantly higher in M3 than in M1 and M2. Therefore, we advise the ridge-furrow planting with film mulching on continuous ridges (i.e.,M3) as an efficient planting and mulching pattern for sustainably improving the seed yield of winter oilseed rape and preserving soil fertility in the semi-arid area of Northwest China.

Currently， China's agriculture is hampered by the scarcity of water resources due to considerable demands in domestic,industrial,and municipal commerce，especially in arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China (Huang,2O14).Water demands are high in arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China where the maintenance of sustainable agricultural development is mostly limited by water scarcity (Cai and Ringler, 2007; Qin et al.， 2014). Adding to this problem is the relatively low efficiency of agricultural water use in arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China (Dalin et al., 2O15). In response to these issues, it is necessary to adopt new management practices and modify existing water conservation practices to improve water use efficiency and agricultural productivity in these regions.

        "text": "One effective method employed to increase crop productivity in arid and semi-arid planting Zonesis the ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting (RFRH） system. Thissystem utilizes plastic-covered ridges as the runoff area and furrows (covered or un-covered) as the infiltration or planting area (Tian et al., 2OO3). The harvesting eficiency of rainwater has been shown to reach approximately $87 \\%$ under the RFRH system because of its high utilization of light rains ( $( < 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ (Li et al., 2OOO). The positive impacts of the RFRH system,including more efficient use of harvested water and high increase of crop production,are well understood for maize (Wang et al., 2009), potato (Qin et al.,2O14),and oilseed rape (Gu et al., 2O17). There are several benefits of using the RFRH system, including extreme simplicity, cost-effectivity, high efficiency and strong adaptability. Generally speaking, the fully-mulched ridge-furrow cropping system can effectively improve soil moisture, extend moisture availability period and increase topsoil temperature (Gan et al.,2Ol3). Despite all this,it may also influence the soil quality due to increases in soil moisture and temperature. ",

        "text": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a good indicator of soil quality and productivity because of its favorable effects on the physical, chemical,and biological properties of soil (Karami et al.,2012). Previous studies have found that film mulching can decrease SOC, however, the decrease of SOC can be minimized at a certain mulching period (Li et al., 2O04). Soil enzymatic activities are important in all biochemical processes in the soil environment and are closely associated with nutrient cycling,energy transfer,and environmental quality (Yao et al., 2OO6; Jiao et al., 2011; Kussainova et al.,2O13). It has been found that the higher soil moisture that occurs under film mulching could promote soil enzyme activity and enhance SOC decomposition (Wang et al., 2016). Film mulching has been shown to improve soil nutrient content, such as total and available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassum (K) (Zhou et al.,2O16). Unfortunately, no consensus has yet been reached regarding the variations of soil nutrients under film mulching. For example, Kou et al. (2O11) reported that the contents of available $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ and K decreased under film mulching. To sum up, it is of great significance to study whether and how film mulching influences SOC, soil enzyme activities and soil nutrients. ",

However, soil temperatures were similar in the four treatments during the late growing periods. Our results agreed with a previous study which demonstrated that mulching can increase soil temperature during the early growing periods (Wang et al.,2O15).These results are likely due to the underdeveloped plant canopy during the early stages of crop development. Solar energy and its heat are trapped when they hit the plastic mulch, in turn warming the topsoil. During the later growing stages, plant-covered plots increase soil temperatures less than uncovered plots, because plants flourish during these periods and block more solar energy (Zhou et al.，2O09). Soil temperatures at depths of 5 and $2 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ were slightly lower in M3 than in M1 and M2,perhaps as a result of higher soil moisture in M3. Additionally, the plant canopy cover was larger in M3 than in M1 and M2. ",

In the $2 0 { - } 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ soil layer, SOC content did not differ markedly between M1, M2 and control in the first and second growing seasons (i.e.,2012-2013 and 2013-2014),indicating that the influence of film mulching on SOC content was minimal in the deep soil layers.

Furthermore,among the three mulching treatments,the TN,TP, TK, nitrate-N,AP and AK contents were always highest in M3,perhaps due to the increased soil moisture accelerated the transfer and diffusion of nutrients (Zhou et al.,2O16).It should be noted that we also found that film mulching did not significantly affect TN, TP and TK contents， but markedly increased nitrate-N, AP and AK contents.
