Further, it can also be used to distinguish different phases and corresponding phase transitions and is considered as a useful tool for keeping track of the degrees of freedom of strongly coupled systems.

        "text": "Holographic superconductor model was first constructed in Refs. [10, 11] where the model is a s-wave one since the condensed field is a scalar field dual to a scalar operator in the field theory side. The holographic approach was also generalized to the p-wave case [12] and d-wave case [13,14]. It is interesting to note that the back reaction of matter field on the background geometry will change the order of the holographic p-wave superconductor phase transition from second order to first order [15]. On the other hand, the effect of higher derivatives on the holographic p-wave model was studied in Refs.[16,17,18]. And near critical point, an analytic study on the holographic p-wave superconductor/conductor phase transition has been made in the probe limit [19, 20]. In Ref.[21],a holographic s-wave superconductor/insulator phase transition model was built at zero temperature. Combining the conductor/superconductor phase transition with the insulator/superconductor phase transition, Horowitz and Way [22] described a complete phase diagram for a holographic S-wave superconductor/conductor/insulator system. In addition, the holographic p-wave superconductor/insulator phase transition was discussed in Ref. [23],and Ref. [24] carried out an analytic study for the holographic superconductor/insulator phase transition. While various properties of holographic superconductor models have been intensively investigated in the literature,in this paper we are interested in the behavior of entanglement entropy in the holographic superconductor models. Refs. [25, 26, 27] studied the behavior of entanglement entropy in holographic conductor/superconductor phase transition models, including S-wave and p-wave cases. It showed that the entanglement entropy decreases as one lowers temperature, indicating the degrees of freedom are reduced at lower temperature,and that the entanglement entropy can tell us not only the occurrence of the phase transition, but also the order of the phase transition. It indicates that entanglement entropy is indeed a good probe to phase transition. In Refs. [28, 29] we investigated the behavior of entanglement entropy in the holographic s-wave superconductor/insulator model, and found that the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential is not monotonic in the superconducting phase: at the beginning of the transition, the entropy first increases and arrives at its maximum at some chemical potential, and then decreases monotonically.

        "text": "In this paper we continue our study of the entanglement entropy in holographic superconductor phase transitions. We here focus on the holographic p-wave superconductor/insulator model, paying main attention on whether those properties of entanglement entropy found in the previous studies are universal or not, in particular, on the nonmonotonic behavior of the entropy in the superconductor/insulator phase transition. This will be helpful to further understand the superconductor/insulator transition. Furthermore,there are also other motivations. It is well known that there is no thermal phase transition in $( 2 + 1 )$ -dimensional field theories due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem or Coleman theorem, which states that in quantum field theory, continuous symmetries cannot be spontaneously broken at finite temperature in systems with suffciently short-range interactions in spatial dimensions $d \\leq 2$ ，which at least tells us that the phase transition can be affected by the space-time dimension of the system. However,one indeed observes the superconducting phase transition in the gravity dual of $( 3 + 1 )$ -dimensional AdS black hole backgrounds [10]. This might be caused by the suppresson of the large fluctuations in the large $N$ limit,which is supposed to be one of conditions for the validness of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, we can study the strongly coupled systems simply through their dual weakly interacting gravity theories. So a natural question arises that how the order of the phase transition of the strongly coupled systems can be affected by the dimension of space-time. Indeed,it is observed in Ref.[27] that in contrast to the $( 3 + 1 )$ -dimensional holographic p-wave superconductor/conductor phase transition, the phase transition in the $( 2 + 1 )$ -dimensional case is always second order, regardless of the strength of the back reaction. To further stress the issue and enrich our understanding of the holographic superconductor phase transitions, therefore it would be helpful to study the full back reacted holographic p-wave superconductor/insulator model ",

        "text": "The p-wave superconducting phase is characterized by the condensation of the vector “hair” [30,12],while the normal insulator phase is described by a pure AdS soliton solution. As one increases the chemical potential, the pure AdS soliton background will become unstable to develop the vector “hair”. The emergence of the “hair” induces the symmetry breaking and gives a finite vacuum expectation value of the dual current operator in the field theory side,which plays the role of order parameter in the holographic phase transition. We will choose the condensate of the current operator along one spatial direction. Thus, the $U ( 1 )$ symmetry as well as the spatial rotational symmetry are broken in the superconducting phase. The order of the transition from the insulator phase to superconducting phase can be either second order or first order, depending on the strength of the back reaction of matter feld on the bulk geometry. For the holographic s-wave superconductor/insulator case,one can find a new first order phase transition inside the superconducting phase [22, 29]. We will see that this does not happen in the p-wave model. In view of the anisotropy in the superconducting phase,we will consider two strip geometries with a finite width along directions parallel to the super current and orthogonal to the super current， respectively. The value of entanglement entropy calculated in former setup is larger than the one in the latter case for given parameters. In addition, no matter of the order of the transition,we find the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential is monotonic. More precisely, the entanglement entropy always increases as the increase of chemical potential. Such result is quite different from the one in the s-wave case. ",

Above the critical chemical potential $\\mu _ { c }$ , the solution with nonvanishing vector “hair” is thermodynamically favored over the pure AdS soliton solution. The emergency of the vector “hair” breaks the $U ( 1 )$ gauge symmetry as well as rotational symmetry and represents the superconducting phase. In contrast to the case in Figure (1) where $\\langle \\hat { J } _ { 1 } ^ { x } \\rangle$ rises continuously from zero at $\\mu _ { c }$ , the case in Figure (2) has a jump in the $\\langle \\hat { J } _ { 1 } ^ { x } \\rangle$ at $\\mu _ { c }$ indicating the first order of the transition. The corresponding charge density is drawn in Figure (3)，which behaves qualitatively similar as the condensation. The order of the phase transition can be seen more clearly from the grand potential $\\Omega$ with respect to chemical potential. For the first case, the grand potential decreases monotonically as one increases the chemical potential, indicating a continuous phase transition. For the second case, the grand potential with respect to chemical potential develops a “swallow tail\",which is a typical feature in first order transition. Thus,as expected,we find that the order of the phase transition depends on the parameter $\\alpha$ , i.e., the strength of the back reaction. The critical value is $\\alpha _ { c } \\simeq 0 . 5 3 8 \\pm 0 . 0 0 2$ ， beyond which the order of the phase transition changes from second order to first order.

A rough phase diagram has been drawn in Ref.[23]. The details depend on the strength of the back reaction. The dependence of the order of phase transition on the back reaction is mentioned there.

Following the above discussion we must calculate the entropies of the connected configuration (13) and the disconnected one (15),respectively. One must take care of the UV divergence for the calculations of each entropy, but the difference of entropies is insensitive to it. Therefore,what we are interested in is the finite part of the entanglement entropy, i.e., $S ^ { d i s c o n }$ and $S ^ { c o n }$ in our discussion. We find that the entanglement entropy with respect to strip width $\\ell$ behaves quite similar for different choice of parameters, i.e., $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ ，which is schematically drawn in Figure (4). We stress here that the entanglement entropy drawn in Figure (4) and hereafter is the finite part with the UV divergent part subtracted off 4 We find that there exists a maximal width $\\ell _ { m a x }$ For $\\ell > \\ell _ { m a x }$ , the connected configuration does not exist and the physical solution comes from the trivial disconnected configuration where the entropy is independent of $\\ell$ . On the Contrary, there are three different branches for the entanglement entropy when $\\ell < \\ell _ { m a x }$ ： Two of them come from connected configurations and the third one corresponds to the disconnected one. The physical entropy can be found by always choosing the lowest branch since it has minimal value. As we can see from Figure (4), the lower connected branch is favored for sufficiently small $\\ell$ . Hence, there is a critical value $\\ell _ { c r i t i c a l }$ below which the connected branch is physically favored. Thus,as we change $\\ell$ ，a phase transition must occur at $\\ell _ { c r i t i c a l }$ , which is just the so called “confinement/deconfinement” phase transition discussed intensively， for example, in Refs.[31, 32, 33]. To be precise， for $\\ell < \\ell _ { c r i t i c a l }$ ， the entanglement entropy comes from the connected configuration and exhibits non-trivial dependence on $\\ell$ ，which describes a “deconfining” phase. For $\\ell > \\ell _ { c r i t i c a l }$ ， the entropy is dominated by the disconnected configuration and is $\\ell$ independent，which indicates a \"confining\" phase. ",

We limited ourselves in this paper to investigate an Einstein-Yang-Mils model, which is dual to the p-wave superconductor/insulator phase transition. In this model, the rotational symmetry acting on $x$ and $y$ is also broken in the superconducting phase. In order to account for such anisotropy, we calculated the entanglement entropy for two kinds of strip geometry with finite width $\\ell$ along $x$ direction and $y$ direction, respectively. In both cases,the “confinement/deconfinement” phase transition always appears. No matter of the order of the phase transition, the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential monotonically increases,which is much different from the s-wave case. Since the entanglement entropy is a non-local quantity in the field theory side and measures the area of a minimal surface extending into the bulk in the holographic description, we do not expect that the entanglement entropy for the two kinds of strip geometry will be qualitatively different. Our calculations indeed confirmed this and the entanglement entropy has a difference only quantitatively. More precisely, the difference increases as the condensate increases. Thus,it is reasonable to conclude that the entanglement entropy indeed describes the new degrees of freedom emerging in the superconducting phase. We also extracted the critical width which behaves non-monotonic with respect to chemical potential. This behavior is the same as the one in the s-wave case. In addition,we further provided the evidence that the entanglement entropy can indeed indicate the appearance and the order of phase transition: In the second order phase transition case, the entanglement entropy is continuous, but its slope has a jump at the critical chemical potential, while in the first order transition case,both the entanglement entropy and its slope have a jump at the critical chemical potential.

Ref. [22] studied $( 3 + 1 )$ -dimensional s-wave superconductor/conductor/insulator phase transition. For the conductor/superconductor case, the order of the phase transition is always second order. In contrast to the conductor/superconductor case, the insulator/superconductor phase transition is second order for small back reaction, for intermediate back reaction,there is an additional first order transition inside the superconducting phase and the transition finally becomes first order for suffciently large back reaction. Similar phenomena exist even when one introduces more complex interaction [29]. Actually, we have also checked the same model in one dimension less, i.e.， in （204号 $( 2 + 1 )$ -dimensional case and found the same result. Let us now consider holographic pwave models. The full back reacted p-wave superconductor/conductor transition in $( 3 + 1 )$ dimensions studied in Ref. [15] shows that the order of the phase transition changes from second order to first order as one increases the strength of the back reaction，while for the $( 2 + 1 )$ -dimensional case, the transition is always second order [27].

Let us note that the order of the phase transition for the p-wave case depends on not only the dimension of space-time, but also the strength of the back reaction. This is quite different from the s-wave case. Furthermore,let us notice that in Ref.[1],the entanglement entropy for a $( 2 + 1 )$ -dimensional chiral p-wave superconductor model is calculated by dividing the system as two parts separated by a hyperplane. In this model, there are four phases separated by three quantum critical points at chemical potential $\\mu = 0$ and $\\pm 4$ ，which are labeled by the Chern number $C h$ as $C h = 0$ ( $| \\mu | > 4$ ， $C h = - 1$ ( $- 4 < \\mu < 0$ )，and $C h = + 1$ （204号 ( $0 < \\mu < + 4$ ). The entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential is presented in Figure 4-(e) of Ref.[1]. One can see from the plot that the behavior of the entanglement entropy depends on not only the phase, but also the aspect ratio $r = N _ { y } / N _ { x }$ , the ratio of lattice number in $y$ direction over in $x$ direction. In particular, in some phases both the monotonic and non-monotonic behaviors appear depending on the value of $r$ .

Therefore consider the entanglement entropy as a measure of the degrees of freedom for a given system，the monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy in the holographic p-wave superconductor/insulator arises naturally. The normal insulator phase can be thought of as having little degrees of freedom due to the mass gap, which is consistent with the vanishing charge density. As we increase the chemical potential, the superconducting phase appears. The growth of the condensate and the charge density indicates that the total degrees of freedom increase，which just accounts for the increase of the entanglement entropy. However, it is stillobviously necessary to understand the different behavior of entanglement entropy in holographic s-wave and p-wave superconductor/insulator transitions. For this, one needs know the details of dual field theories for these two kinds of models. In principle, one can finish this task if one could embed these two models into string theory or Mtheory. Unfortunately, we have not yet had the microscopic theories for these two models. Nevertheless, the phenomenological bottom-up approach we adopted here can provide some basic information of a particular class of strongly coupled field theory. In this sense it might also helpful to use the entanglement entropy as a probe to study the holographic d-wave models [34]. ",
