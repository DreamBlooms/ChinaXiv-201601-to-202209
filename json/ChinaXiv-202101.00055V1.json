        "text": "Abstract: Rainfal-runoff relationship in arid regions is unique and challenging to study.Studies for bridging the hydro-meteorological knowledge gap for planning,designing and managing water resources is therefore vitally important. The objective of this study is to develop a method for estimating unit hydrograph at reasonably finer time resolutions (1O-min and 1-h) which can be easily adaptable by practitioners at subcatchment levels, especially when the focus area is ungauged. Observed wadi-flow at 5-min interval and tipping bucket rainfal measurements at 1-min interval were obtained to cover 10 major watersheds in Oman. The deconvolution method was applied to derive the unit hydrographs (UHs) from wadi-flow and excess rainfall. Key catchment characteristics such as the watershed area,length of the main wadi and the length to the centroid of the catchment area were derived from digital elevation model (DEM) data.The whole study area was then divided into 515 sub-catchments with various shapes and sizes. A strong relationship was found between the wadi length and the length to the centroid of the catchment area $( \\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } { > } 0 . 8 9 )$ . This relationship was then adopted to simplify the classcal Snyder method to determine UHs. Moreover,several parameters of the Snyder method were calibrated to the arid environment by matching the peak-flow, lag-time and three time-widths ( $7 5 \\%$ $50 \\%$ and $30 \\%$ of the peak-flow) of $1 0 \\mathrm { - m i n }$ and 1-h UHs with physical characteristics of the watersheds.All developed relationships were validated with independent rainfall and wadi-flow events. Results indicate that the calibrated parameters in these arid watersheds are quite distinct from those suggested for other regions of the world.A marked difference was found between the $1 0 \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { m i n }$ UHs estimated by the S-hydrograph method and the deconvolution method. Therefore,it is concluded that a method depends on natural hydro-meteorological conditions would be more practical in arid region. The proposed methodology can be used for water resources management in arid regions having similar climate and geographical settings. ",

Damages caused by the flash floods exaggerate as population growth and asset progressively expands in flood-prone areas (Hering et al., 2004; Kazama et al.,2OO9; Merz et al.,201O).

In response to these issues, hydro-metrological data network has been expanded and updated in various countries (Sen,2Oo8). As a result, many of the large watersheds in Oman have been equipped with river-gauge stations at their outlets,which provides an important opportunity to understand complex rainfall-runoff relationship in arid regions and will eventually enhance the clarity of water management and adaptation measures. Owing to population growth and industrialization, urbanization gradually expands from coastal vally areas to the upstream catchment areas in Oman.

However, parameters appeared in empirical relations are subjected to a great level of uncertainty when the original equations are applied with radically different hydrometeorological conditions.For example, Snyder (1938) developed a set of empirical equations for the time-lag and peak-flow of his proposed synthetic UH by analyzing runoff characteristics in a large number of drainage-areas ( $( 2 6 - 2 6 , 0 0 0 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 } )$ in Appalachian Highland in eastern United State. Since then, many studies have been conducted to regionalize model parameters in many parts of the world. Borga et al.

Usul and Tezcan (1995) developed UHs from runoff data for four catchment areas in Turkey.The characteristics of these UHs were then matched with the Snyder's synthetic UH to obtain a set of parameters best-fit with local site conditions. Jena and Tiwari (2OO6) applied a similar methodology in two medium sized agricultural watersheds and a set of model parameters applicable for West Bengal state in India were proposed.El Hassan et al.

A set of type curves were presented to develop the UH based on three simple but important catchment characteristics: watershed area, length of the main wadi and length to the centroid of the watershed along the main wadi from its outlet. This relationship was developed based on Snyder's UH method but was easily operationalizable for practical designs in ungauged catchment areas. Most of the past studies selected coarse time durations (e.g.,1-h or 2-h) when developing UHs due to the absence of rainfall and wadi-flow in finer time resolutions. UHs with coarse time resolutions might not be accurately convertible to finer time durations to match with the intense and short-duration rainfall events common in arid regions.This study used wadi-flow data accumulated at $1 0 \\mathrm { - m i n }$ intervals at the outlets of 12 watersheds with catchment area ranges from 45 to $1 6 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ in Oman.

In fact, most of the watersheds in arid regions have ephemeral-type rivers that produce water flow temporally during the rainfalland dried up immediately due to extremely high evaporation demand and infiltration rate. Therefore,base-flow is essentially negligible and excess rainfall volume is equal to the integrated area under the hydrograph. The reverse process of the discrete UH convolution technique, known as the deconvolution method (Chow et al.,1988),was applied to derive a UH from river-flow and excess rainfall.

When there are more than two hydrographs available for a catchment area,they were all used for verifying the calibrated UHs.The coefficients of determination $( R ^ { 2 } { > } 0 . 8 9 )$ evident for a good agreement between observed and simulated wadi-flows. Some level of differences between observed and simulated wadi-flows can be attributed not only to the limitations of the model itself but also to the various issues such as observational errors of wadi-flows and rainfalls，and inadequacy of the meteorological stations to capture the spatial distribution of the rainfall events.

        "text": "When a UH of a given excess-rainfall duration is available, the principle of superposition (Shydrograph method) can be used to derive the UHs of any required duration (Chow et al.,1988). Accordingly,1-h UHs developed in the previous stage were used to calculate 10-min UHs.Also, another set of 1O-min UHs were derived using 1O-min rainfall and wadi-flow data applied with the deconvolution method. Figure 4 depicts a marked difference of the 10-min UHs developed by these two methods for Aday watershed. Similar phenomenon in different magnitudes were observed in all watersheds where the 10-min UH developed by the 10-min rainfall and wadi-flow data produced a greater peak-flow. The reason for this difference can be attributed to the assumptions made in deriving UHs.For example,it is assumed that the excess rainfallis uniformly distributed over the entire watershed at a constant rate for the selected duration. This assumption,under natural conditions in arid regions,can rarely be satisfied.Arid regions experience occasional rainfall events with intensity varies significantly over time (Greenbaum et al.,1998). Therefore,such difference between theoretical S-hydrograph method and the deconvolution method with real data can be expected.Figure 5 shows the peak-flow simulated by these two methods and their match with the observed 1O-min averaged peak-flow.It is noted that the UH derived from the S-hydrograph method underestimated the peak-flow up to $30 \\%$ while the deconvolution method with short-term real data produced promising results. It is also clear that this diference between the observed and simulated peak-flows by the S-hydrograph method increases as the catchment area increase.These results therefore demand appropriate modifications for existing methods used for wadi-flow estimation in arid regions.

Theoretically, the lag-time of the 10-min UH should be smaller than that of the 1-h UH (Fig.4).

It was further assumed that onethird of this width is distributed before the UH peak time and two-third after the peak (Chow et al., 1988; Angelidis et al.,2O1O). Accordingly, three relationships were developed for the time-width at $7 5 \\%$ $50 \\%$ and $30 \\%$ of the peak-flow based on the derived UHs (Fig.8).It is clear that the timewidth is inversely proportional to the peak-flow per unit watershed area.

Attributed to the steep slope,flow is faster in arid regions resulting in shorter rising limb and greater peak-flow.The total discharge significantly decreases within short periods of time due to high rates of evaporation and transmission loss. Wadi-beds in these regions are generally composed of alluvial sediments dominated by highly permeable coarser grain sizes.Therefore,1:2 width-ratio as suggested by Snyder (1938) may not be applicable in arid regions.A series of UHs was developed forl-h and 1O-min durations for all study areas based on empirical relationships developed in previous steps (Figs.2,6,7 and 8).When compare these UHs with ones derived from observed wadi-flow, it was determined that the 3:4 width-ratio produced beter results than the 1:2 widthratio.For example,Figure 9 shows a comparison of 1O-min UHs developed for Afi watershed with two different width-ratios.It is clear that the 3:4 width-ratio formed shorter rising limb than the 1:2 width-ratio and matches better with the derived UH from observed wadi-flow.

It is clear that the simulations by the 1-h UHs agree better with the observations than the results from the 1O-min UHs.When simulating wadi-flows at finer time resolutions, uncertainty arises due to temporal and spatial variations of rainfall events, especially in arid regions. However,time averaged 1-h wadi-flows smooth the abrupt variations at 10-min interval and therefore produced beter agreements. All simulations reasonably capture different features of the hydrographs,such as the general trend, peak-flow, time-lag etc., when match with the observations.It therefore indicates that the developed empirical relationships can be applied in deriving UHs particularly for arid regions in Oman.

For example,wadi length can easily be estimated by automatic delineation from DEM data or even by manual methods. However, calculation of the catchment centroid is rather difficult, especially when paper based topographic maps are used. Results of this study indicate that the strong relationship found between the wadi length and the length to the centroid of the catchment area can be adopted to simplify the existing methods to determine UHs.Moreover, it was found that the principle of superposition with the assumption of uniform excess rainfall distribution would not be applicable in arid regions.A marked difference was found between the 1O-min UHs estimated by the S-hydrograph method and deconvolution method.Therefore,it is concluded that a method depends on natural hydro-meteorological conditions would be more practical in arid region.
