Spines are typically classified into three types based on the shape information:mushroom,stubby, and thin.“Mushroom” spine has a bulbous head with a thin neck;“stubby”spine only has a bulbous head;“thin” spine has a long thin neck with a small head.Research has shown that the changes in shape,length,and size of dendritic spines are closely linked with neurological and psychiatric disorders,such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),autism,intellectual disability,Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease [1-5]. Therefore, the morphology analysis and identification of structure of dendritic spines are critical for diagnosis and further treatment of these diseases [6,7]. ",

        "text": "Traditional manual detection approach of dendritic spines detection is costly and time consuming and prone to errordue to human subjectiveness.With the recent advances in biomedical imaging,computer-aided semiautomatic or automatic approaches to detect dendritic spines based on image analysis have shown the efficacy. SynD method proposed by Schmitz et al.[8] is a semiautomatic image analysis routine to analyze dendrite and synapse characteristics in immune-fluorescence images.For the fluorescence imaging,the neurite and soma were captured in the separated imaging channels. In that case, soma and synapse were detected without intervention from neurite [9-ll] based on the channel information.However, this method cannot be extended to the images,of which the information is captured in the same channel. Therefore,many other methods were proposed to solve this problem,for instance,ImageJ [12],NeuronStudio [13], NeuronJ [14],and NeuronIQ[15]. However, these methods have some limitations. For example,NeuronIQ was designed for the confocal multiphoton laser scanning. NeuronJ was used to trace the dendrite growing in the condition of manually marking the dendrite first.Koh et al. detected spines from stacks of image data obtained by laser scanning microscopy [16]. The algorithm first extracted the dendrite backbone defined as the medial axis and then geometric information was employed to detect the attached and detached spines according to the shape of each candidate spine region. Features including spine length, volume, density,and shape for static and time-lapse images of hippocampal pyramidal neurons were used as key points for the detection. The disadvantage of this method is that it might lose many spines during the detection because of the thresholding method used in this case.To overcome this problem, Xu et al. proposed a new detection algorithm for the attached spines from the dendrites by two grassfire steps [17]: a global threshold was chosen to segment the image and then the medial axis transform (MAT) was applied to find the centerlines of the dendrites. Then some large spines (noncenterlines) were removed from the centerlines. After the backbone was extracted, two grassfire procedures were applied to separate the spine and dendrite.The results of the proposed method were similar to the results of the manual method. Cheng et al. proposed a method using an adaptive threshold based on the local contrast to determine the foreground,containing the spine and dendrite,and detect attached and detached spines [18]. Fan et al. used the curvilinear structure detector to find the medial axis of the dendrite backbone and spines attached to the backbone [19]. To locate the boundary of dendrite,an adaptive local binary fitting (aLBF) energy level set model was_proposed for localization. Zhang et al. extracted the boundaries and the centerlines of the dendrite by estimating the second-order directional derivatives for both the dendritic backbones and spines [2o]. Then a classifier based on Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA） was built to classfy the attached spines into true and false types. The accuracy of the algorithm was_calculated according to the backbone length, spine number, spine length,and spine density. Janoos et al. used the medial geodesic to extract the centerlines of the dendritic backbone [21].He etal. proposed a method based on NDE to classify the dendrite and spines [22]. The principle of their method was that spine and dendrite had different shrink rates. Shi et al. proposed a wavelet-based supervised method for_classifying 3D dendritic spines from neuron images [231. ",

Since the slices along the optical direction $( z )$ provided very limited information and the computation time based on the 3D image stacks is highly increased,it was desired to consider only the 2D projection onto the $x y$ plane. The 2D image used for analysis was a maximum intensity projection of the original 3D stack. It was obtained by projecting in the xy plane the voxels with maximum intensity values that fall in the way of parallel rays traced from the viewpoint to the plane of projection. ",

        "text": "2.5.Spine Detection Based on Regularized Morphological Shared-Weight Neural Network (RMSNN). Considering the dendritic spine's structure,we have employed the regularized morphological shared-weight neural networks for the detection and classification of spines. The regularized morphological shared-weight neural networks consist of two-phase heterogeneous neural networks in series as shown in Figure 4: the first phase is for feature extraction and the second phase is for classification.In the first phase,it is accomplished via the gray-scale Hit-Miss transform. The feature extraction phase has multiple feature extraction layers.Each layer is composed of one or more feature maps. Each feature map is generated by the Hit-Miss transform with a pair of structure elements (SEs) from the previous layer and is accompanied by a new pair of SEs,in which one is for the erosion and the other one is for the dilation. In the classification stage, it shows a fully connected Feedforward Neural Network(FNN) [32- 34]. The input of FNN is the direct output of the feature extraction stage. The output of the classification stage is a three-node layer,in which each node stands for one type of spine.Figure 4 shows the structure of the morphological shared-weight neural network (MSNN) [35]. The MSNN has been widely applied in the following research fields, including laser radar (LADAR), forward-looking infrared (FLIR),synthetic aperture radar, and visual spectrum image. The existing research demonstrates that the MSNN is robust for detection with rotation, image intensity translation, and occlusion variables [36]. In this paper, we have proposed to apply the regularized morphological shared-weight neural network to spine classification. ",
