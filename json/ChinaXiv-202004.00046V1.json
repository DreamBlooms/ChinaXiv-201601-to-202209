This paper takes Inner Mongolia of China,a unique arid/semi-arid ecosystem,as the study area.We first detected trend features of climate variables using the linear trend analysis method and then detected their trend-shift features using the breaks for additive seasonal and trend method based on the time-series of monthly precipitation and monthly mean temperature datasets from 1962 to 2016. We analyzed the different change features of precipitation and temperature on a regional scale and in different ecological zones to discover the spatial heterogeneity of change features.The results showed that Inner Mongolia has become warmer-weter during the past 54 years. The regional annual mean temperature increased $0 . 4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ per decade with a change rate of $56 . 2 \\%$ . The regional annual precipitation increased $0 . 0 7 { \\mathrm { ~ m m } }$ per decade with a slightly change rate of about $1 . 7 \\%$ ,but the trend was not statistically significant.The warmer trend was contributed by the same positive trend in each season, while the wetter trend was contributed by the negative trend of the summer precipitation and the positive trend of the other three seasons. The regional monthly precipitation series had a trend-shift pattern with a structural breakpoint in the year 1999,while the regional monthly mean temperature series showed an increasing trend without a periodical trend-shift.After the year 2OO0,the warmer-wetter trend of the climate in Inner Mongolia was accelerated. The late $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century was a key period, because the acceleration of the weter trend in some local zones (I and II) and the alleviation of the warmer trend in some local zones (VII, VIII and IX) occurred simultaneously. Moreover, the change features had a strong spatial heterogeneity, the southeastern and southwestern of Inner Mongolia went through a warmer-drier trend compared with the other areas.The spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the climate change features is a necessry background for various types of research,such as regional climate change,the evolution of arid/semi-arid ecosystems, and the interaction mechanisms between climate and arid/semi-arid ecosystems based on earth-system models in Inner Mongolia.

It has predicted by several studies that severe storms and heatwaves prolonged drought and raised sea levels in the near future (Charles, 2012; Dufresne et al., 2013; Leng et al.,2015; Mora et al.,2017) could dramatically influence the habitats of all life on the planet (Mora et al., 2O17). Climate variables are the key parameters in many models based on the earth-atmosphere system. Accurately analyzing the change features of climate variables is not only essential for monitoring and forecasting climate change but also important for the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems.

Inner Mongolia, an especially sensitive region in China, has one of the most unique arid/semi-arid ecosystems (Peng et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2018). Because of global climate change and rapid economic growth during the past decades, the regional ecosystem has changed greatly (Xu et al., 2O16).The Chinese government has launched several ecological restoration programs in this area since 2000 (Chen et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2017), such as the \"Three-North Shelterbelt Project\",the \"Grain for Green Project\" and the \"Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project\"，which have greatly influenced the relationship between humans and nature.Therefore, the Inner Mongolia of China has become one of the most attractive areas for the studies about arid/semi-arid ecosystem (Chen et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015b; Zhang et al.，2018)， such as climate change analysis (Peng et al., 2013)，climate-vegetation relationship analysis (Bhandari et al.,2O15; Tong et al.,2O17) and land cover change (Guo et al., 2014).

They are also important parameters for the calculation of various arid indices (Huang et al.,2O16) and for the construction of earth-atmosphere models (Fisher et al.,2Ol7).Therefore, it is crucial to detect the detailed and accurate change features of the time-series of precipitation and temperature datasets in Inner Mongolia.Previous studies mainly focused on the overall trend analysis of these two variables and contrary results were found in different studies,e.g., Hu et al. (2O15) found that Inner Mongolia became warmer-drier from 1961 to 2012, while others demonstrated a warmer-weter trend (Geng et al.,2016; Hu et al.,2017; Qin et al.,2018). Meanwhile, the trend-shift features in the time-series of precipitation and temperature in Inner Mongolia are interesting but have rarely been analyzed. Hu et al. (2O15) found that the increasing trend in global temperature has slowed down since the late 199Os. It was unknown whether temperature change in Inner Mongolia reflected the same pattern. Hu et al. (2O17) also found a nonlinear change in precipitation in Inner Mongolia through observing the time-series change trajectory. The detection of climate trend-shift features in Inner Mongolia could not only reveal the detailed change patterns from an apparently consistent trend line, but also elucidate the coupled and response relationship between climate and arid/semi-arid ecosystems. It has been confirmed that there is a nonlinear relationship between climate variables and vegetation cover in arid/semi-arid ecosystems (Wu et al., 2017; Harrison et al.,2018). The detection of detailed and accurate change features, especially the nonlinear change features within a time-series of precipitation and temperature， is useful for understanding the nonlinear relationships between climate variables and vegetation ecosystems in Inner Mongolia.

The missing data at the beginning or end of the time-series were replaced by the average values of those months in all the other years,while the remaining missing data were filled using the linear interpolation method (Hu et al., 2015). The missing data, overall, comprised less than $0 . 0 8 \\%$ of all datasets.In each meteorological station, there are 653 points within each monthly precipitation and monthly mean temperature series. Al the 653 points were used in analyzing decade-scale trendshift features based on the breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) method.Monthly mean temperature series were reconstructed to annual mean temperature series with 54 points from 1962 to 2015 by averaging the monthly values within each year. Monthly precipitation series were reconstructed to annual precipitation series with 54 points from 1962 to 2015 by the accumulated monthly values within each year. The annual mean series were used to analysis the overall trend based on linear trend detection method.The data in 2O16 were not involved in reconstructing the annual mean series because there were not enough samples in this year. The series of different seasons were reconstructed by accumulating the value of different months within each year, i.e., spring (March to May), summer (June to August), autumn (September to November) and winter (December to February in the next year). These seasonal accumulated time series temperature and precipitation datasets were used to analysis seasonal trend features. ",

BFAST is a multiple breakpoint detection method based on the trend-seasonal decomposition method and structural change tests，which is developed from econometric models (Zeileis et al., 200l,2005; Zeileis,2005). It has been successfully used to detect trend and seasonal structural changes in the normalized difference vegetation index timeseries datasets (Verbesselt et al.,201Oa,b) and has been proved to be a powerful method to detect structural changes in time-series models.The method has been proved less sensitive to cyclical changes in time-series (Verbesselt et al.,2010a; Jong et al.,2013). BFAST used iterative strategies to gradually find the breakpoints based on a trend-seasonal decomposition model and structural change detection model(Zeileis etal.,2001,2005; Zeileis,2005; Jong etal.,2013).The final output model was determined by a best-fit model,i.e.,the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).

(2015). However, it was obviously higher than the global warming rate of $0 . 1 4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ per decade and the warming rate of $0 . 3 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ per decade in the Tibetan Plateau (Yang et al., 2Ol4), which is another unique arid area in China.This indicated that the arid/semi-arid area experienced a more accelerated warming trend than other areas around the world, with trend features possessng strong spatial heterogeneity in the world's different arid/semi-arid areas.The conclusion that temperature in winter increased faster than in summer was consistent with previous studies (Borjigin, 2O15),and February was found to have the strongest temperature increasing trend in a previous study (Hu et al., 2O15). Although we did not find a trend-shift change in the regional monthly mean temperature series, we did find it in the local monthly mean temperature series, in 1996 around Ordos Plateau (zone IX), Yinshan Mountains (zone VII) and Hetao-Tumochuan Plain (zone VII). The change pattern in these areas corresponded to the previous conclusions that the increasing trend in global temperature has slowed down since the late 1990s (Hu et al., 2017). ",

The strong inter-annual variation in the annual precipitation series might be the reason for contrary results in previous studies based on different study periods. The negative trend in the summer accumulated precipitation series was also confirmed by other studies in Inner Mongolia (Geng et al., 2016; Hu et al.,20l7),and this feature was consistent across the whole Mongolian Plateau in northeastern Asia (Qin et al., 2018). We further analyzed the regional summer accumulated precipitation series and the results showed no trend-shift features. The detected trend-shift features in the regional precipitation series were consistent with previous results indicated by observing the time-series change trajectory (Hu et al., 2017). ",

After the late $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century, the warmer-wetter trend of climate in Inner Mongolia accelerated. However, the West Liaohe River Plain (zone V) and Ordos Plateau (zone IX), located in the southeastern and southwestern Inner Mongolia, respectively, went through a warmer-drier trend different from that in other zones. More attention should be paid to water management for sustainable development of the environment in areas with more fragile ecosystems,such as the Horqin Sandy Land in the north part of zone V and the Mu Us Sandy Land in zone IX. In other pastoral areas, such as the Xilingol Plateau, although the precipitation decreased slightly， the obvious and dramatic temperature increase might have accelerated regional evaporation and somehow influenced the typical, widely distributed, warm-temperate steppe. In some traditional agricultural areas, such as the southern zone V, the decreased precipitation may have decreased the precipitation-related corn yield. ",

Our results indicated that the regional precipitation-vegetation relationship may change after the structural break year of the precipitation series. Trend-shift features in precipitation may provide a new perspective for studies on arid ecological resilience, which focus on the nonlinear dynamics observed in arid ecosystems (Holling,1973; Wu et al., 2017).

However, the results from this paper provide important background information for further studies on the nonlinear relationship between climate and vegetation in arid/semi-arid areas.

The results were as follows: (1) A warmer-wettr trend was shown during the past 54 years from 1962 to 2015.The regional annual mean temperature series increased $0 . 4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ per decade with a change rate of $56 . 2 \\%$ .The regional annual precipitation series slightly increased $0 . 0 7 { \\mathrm { m m } }$ per decade with change rate of about $1 . 7 \\%$ ，but the trend was not statistically significant. (2) The wammer trend was attributed to the same positive trend in each season (winter>spring>autumn $>$ summer),while the wetter trend was contributed by the negative trend of the summer precipitation and the positive trend of the other three seasons (autumn>spring>winter). It showed the study area went through a warmer-drier summer, and at the same time a warmer-wetter spring,autumn and winter. (3) The monthly precipitation series had a trend-shift pattern with a structural breakpoint in 1999 separating the whole series into two sub-periods. The trend change in the second period was dramatically higher than in the first period followed by an obvious drop in precipitation in 1999.The monthly mean temperature series showed an increased trend without periodical trend changes.Therefore, the warmer-wetter trend of climate in Inner Mongolia accelerated after the year 2Oo0.(4) Local Zones went through a warmer-drier trend compared with other areas,such as zone V and IX.The late $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century was a key period because the acceleration of the wetter trend in zones I and II, and the alleviation of the warmer trend in zones VI, VII and IX,occurred simultaneously.
