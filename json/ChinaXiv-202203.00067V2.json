        "text": "The growing interest in Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) High-entropy alloys (HEAs） during most recent years,the design of elements and scanning strategies are primary methods to overcome the defects such as porosity, pores, and segregation etc. Here we propose a new approach,a novel real-time Laser Shocking of Melt Pool (LSMP),to obtain melt pool modifications to yield beter HEAs.LSMP moves a pulsed laser into a liquid melt pool caused by a continuous wave laser, enabling non-destructive and real-time fabrication of high-performance HEAs. The numerical simulation reveals the convection mechanism of the melt pool in the LSMP process,and the intervention of the pulsed laser promotes melt pool flow type to convert the Marangoni eect into a multi-convective ring, which accelerates melt pool flow and the columnar crystal growth is significantly inhibited. Experimental results show the evolution law of the microstructure in the LSMP process. CrFeCoNi HEAs forms a stable FCC structure without segregation and other defects. Meanwhile,the microstructure undergoes a Columnar-Equiaxed Transition (CET),and CrFeCoNi HEAs with higher nano-hardness are obtained. Furthermore,the reduction in the (111) interplanar spacing demonstrates laser shock induces beneficial compressive stress. Therefore,it is necessary to consider introducing laser shock at appropriate conditions to control the melt pool online. ",

But, typical metallurgical defects such as porosity,pores,and segregation in conventional as-cast HEAs affect the final properties,which limit the potential application of HEAs.Fortunately, Brief et al.[2] firstly used Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM） technology to obtain HEAs with beter mechanical properties than as-cast samples, demonstrating the feasibility of LAMed HEAs. It not only shortens the process cycle but also provides a faster and more effcient method for manufacturing complex HEAs parts. Besides,Moghaddam et al.[3] presented a conclusion of current state and future prospects of additive manufacturing (AM) of HEAs. ",

        "text": "However,the high thermal stress caused by the thermal cycle of the melt pool during the LAM process also brings many hazards. Zhang et al.[8]observed cracks in the CoCrFeNiMn HEAs samples obtained under different scanning strategies,resulting in low densities.Niu et al.[9] also found the same result. And many scholars have joined the ranks to solve this problem. For example, Jiang et al. [10] shows the presence of FCC phase significantly reduces the internal stress of the specimen by the addition of Fe-based amorphous.In addition,the indeterminate cooling rate of the melt pool,a critical factor, also directly affects the recrystallization species,leading to various types of HEAs with different properties. Li et al.[11] reveals the formation mechanism of microstructures in HEAs rapidly cooled to room temperature at nanoscale through Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. At present, most HEAs prepared by Laser Melting Deposition (LMD) exhibit a typical dendritic structure, because the scan rate of LMD is significantly lower than that of the SLM process, causing a low cooling rate so that equiaxed crystals cannot be achieved. Therefore, Tong et al.[12] found the microstructure of the CoCrFeNiMn HEAs fabricated by LAM is mainly columnar crystals inside the melt pool, while the outside of the melt pool is equiaxed grains. After heat treatment at $1 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , the structure is completely equiaxed grains. Certainly,subsequent heat treatments such as Knowles et al.[13] used a range of annealing processes after Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS） and Li et al.[7] applied the Hot isostatic pressng (HIP) after SLMed HEAs are detrimental to the continuity and production efficiency of the AM proces However, Tong et al.[14] shows different process parameters such as laser power and scanning speed in the LAM process can directly obtain different microstructures because the ratio of the thermal gradient and solidification rate inside melt pool is the dominant factor in Columnar-Equiaxed Transition (CET).

The Laser Shock Peening (LSP) as a advanced technology which not only induced high compressive stress on the surface of metal components and structures but also achieved to control at the micro-nano level.For example,Hu et al.[15,16] realized ultrafast direct fabrication of plasmonic nanoarrays by LSP. A novel synchronous Laser Shocking of Melt Pool (LSMP) method is proposed to suppress thermal stress,enhance melt pool convections and inhibit columnar crystal growth.Not only that, it extends the efort that Tong et al.[14] used the LSP as a post-processing treatment to in-situ modification to improve the LAMed HEAs. Although the pulsed laser is widely used in material properties strengthening，to our knowledge there had not been any research on synchronous hybrid additive manufacturing processes with laser shocking of melt pool to overcome the surface tension of liquid metal. In this paper, the action mechanism of LSMP by combining experiments and numerical simulations is studied. We reveal the convection mechanism inside the melt pool with the assistance of pulsed laser. As a result,the microstructure evolution law of HEAs produced by LSMP is obtained,achieving non-destructive real-time production of higher-performance CoCrFeNi HEAs. ",

From the local bottom boundary enlarged view of the melt pool, there is a good bond between the HEA and the substrate,indicating the formed sample has a good tensile ability. Columnar dendrites were observed at the bottom of the melt pool, growing upward perpendicular to the substrate boundaries.In the LAM process,the laser irradiation area is the center of the heat source,and the processed area belongs to the cooling layer, then a high-temperature gradient is formed between them,which driven the columnar dendrites to grow upward along the temperature gradient from the bottom of the melt pool as shown in Fig.9(b). Further, the solid and liquid lines inside the melt pool are promoted to show a directional solidification trend from the inside to the outside and the bottom to the top.When reaching the middle and upper region of the melt pool,a lower temperature gradient due to the distance from the heat source cannot drive the epitaxial growth of columnar dendrites.At the same time, the EDS results of the columnar dendrites in Fig.9(b)area show that Cr,Fe,Co,and Ni elements are uniformly distributed in the sample as shown in Fig.9(c),and no segregation defects appear.

Before entering the cooling stage,the shocking module is removed to observe the liquid surface oscillation process. The total step of the cooling is 40ps as shown in Fig.A1,and the SLM process has no shock module. Clearly,the liquid melt pool oscillates after being stressed, the shock wave propagates in three-dimensional directions as shown in Fig.A1(b).At 4ps,the oscilated molten pool diffused to the solid phase and the substrate respectively. Until 2Ops,the temperature of the melt pool decreased and began to gradually solidify. After cooling,the shape of SLM model has no significant changes. But ， the shape of LSMP model does not recovers to similar state and becomes flat.The changes in the melt pool profile also agree with the 3D profile data.This phenomenon indirectly indicates that the cooling rate of the being shaken melt pool is increased,and it has solidified before returning to similar state of SLM model .

In our previous experiments,the laser energy 3J wil produce beneficial oscillations effect,that is,the case of 1km in MD.At this time,the MSD of the atoms in the melt pool is the largest, indicating that the atomic movement ability is particularly strong, which will accelerate the escape of the heating source.
