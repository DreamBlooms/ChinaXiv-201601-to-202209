It is expected that the spatial-temporal characteristics of drought in regions with complex terrain can be better represented by meteorological data with the high spatial-temporal resolution and accuracy. In this study, Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated with meteorological factors extracted from ITPCAS (China Meteorological Forcing Dataset produced by the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences) was applied to identify the spatial-temporal characteristics of drought in Shaanxi Province of China, during the period of 1979-2016. Drought areas detected by SPEI calculated with data from ITPCAS (SPEI-ITPCAS) on the seasonal scale were validated by historical drought records from the Chinese Meteorological Disaster Canon-Shaanxi, and compared with drought areas detected by SPEI calculated with data from OMS (SPEI-OMS). Drought intensity, trend and temporal ranges for mutations of SPEI-ITPCAS were analyzed by using the cumulative drought intensity (CDI) index and the Mann-Kendall test. The results indicated that drought areas detected from SPEI-ITPCAS were closer to the historical drought records than those detected from SPEI-OMS. Severe and exceptional drought events with SPEI-ITPCAS lower than $- 1 . 0$ occurred most frequently in summer, followed by spring.There was a general drying trend in spring and summer in Shaanxi Province and a significant weting trend in autumn and winter in northern Shaanxi Province. On seasonal and annual scales, the regional and temporal ranges for mutations of SPEI-ITPCAS were different and most mutations occurred before the year 1990 in most regions of Shaanxi Province. The results reflect the response of different regions of Shaanxi Province to climate change, which will help to manage regional water resources. ",

PDSI requires parameters including soil water holding capacity, groundwater level and lake/reservoir level (Ma et al., 2O15), which are not available in many circumstances. Furthermore, the temporal scale of PDSI is fixed (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2011), although drought is a multi-scale phenomenon (Changnon and Easterling, 1989; Pandey and Rafmasastri, 2010). Sc-PDSI is an improved version of PDSI (Wels et al., 2O04; Liu et al., 2015), but the temporal scale is still not alterable. In contrast, SPEI combines the sensitivity of PDSI to evaporation changes and the multi-temporal nature of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (Vicente-Serrano et al.,2O1Oa). Besides, it needs fewer parameters compared with PDSI when the Thornthwaite (Th) method is used to calculate evaporation. Thus, SPEI has been widely used to elaborate the spatial-temporal characteristics of regional drought and to reconstruct the spatialtemporal distribution of drought (Allen etal., 2O11; Meza, 2013).

        "text": "Much research on drought quantification, monitoring and analysis has been conducted by machine learning models or spatial interpolation methods with metrological factors extracted from observations from meteorological stations (OMS) (Jiang et al., 2015; Rhee and Im, 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). However, the spatial interpolation of metrological factors (e.g., precipitation) brings significant errors due to the sparse observations and the complex terrain. Accuracy of SPEI forecasting by machine learning models with multisource data needs further theoretical investigation, particularly because SPEI may vary under diferent climatic conditions (Rhee and Im, 2O17). It is more reliable to adopt meteorological datasets with high spatial-temporal resolution to directly quantify the drought based on drought indices (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010b; Hannaford et al., 2O11; Wang et al., 2O16). Many studies have tested the applicability of various meteorological datasets in drought analysis at multiple scales under different climatic conditions. For example, Salehnia et al. (2O17b) calculated eight drought indices with AgMERRA (Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project based on the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) precipitation data and OMS data for drought monitoring. Results showed that the correlation between drought events and the former was higher than that between drought events and the latter. Naumann et al. (2O14) investigated five different datasets and three drought indicators with regard to their capability to improve drought monitoring in Africa. They found that the extents of drought areas identified by drought indicators were different. Spinoni et al. (2019) constructed a dataset of meteorological drought events from 1951 to 2016 based on Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and Climatic Research Unit (CRU) time-series datasets with a spatial resolution of $0 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ . It can be concluded that the spatial resolution and accuracy of the gridded meteorological data and a suitable drought index were essential to identify the occurrence, intensity and spatial extent of drought.

In contrast, there were significant discrepancies of drought areas between the remaining seasons, indicating that meteorological data extracted from OMS and ITPCAS were not spatially consistent with drought monitoring for most of the seasons. As shown in Table 1, drought occurred in all10 APCs of Shaanxi Province in nine seasons: springs of 1997 and 2001; summers of 1997 and 1999; autumns of 1995, 1998 and 2010; and winters of 1998 and 2Oo8. In the above nine seasons, the distribution of drought areas identified from SPEI-ITPCAS (Fig. 2) was consistent with the historical records from the Chinese Meteorological Disaster Canon-Shaanxi (Table 1). In contrast, in summer of 1999 and winter of 2008, drought areas identified from SPEI-OMS (Fig. 3) were different with the historical drought records from the Chinese Meteorological Disaster Canon-Shaanxi (Table 1), with the absence of north of Guanzhong.

Compared with the seasons and regions in which drought events occurred, the discrepancies of drought areas between the two SPEI results and historical records happened in summer and in north of Guanzhong and northern Shaanxi frequently. Discrepancies of drought areas listed in Table 3 were similar to those in the same season listed in Table 4. However, Table 4 presents more discrepancies than Table 3. Discrepancies of drought areas shown in Table 4 were more likely to occur in Yulin, Tongchuan and Weinan, which were frequently affected by drought. In conclusion, the detection of drought areas from SPEI-ITPCAS presented a higher accuracy than that from SPEI-OMS. Therefore, SPEI-ITPCAS was adopted to analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics of drought in Shaanxi Province. ",

On seasonal and annual scales, the cumulative SPEI-ITPCAS was within $- 1 0 . 0$ to $- 1 4 . 0$ in most regions of Shaanxi Province. When the cumulative SPEI-ITPCAS was less than $- 1 4 . 0$ , the region was defined as a typical area with high CDI values. On the winter scale, the cumulative SPEI-ITPCAS was within $- 1 6 . 0$ to $- 2 0 . 0$ in most regions of Shaanxi Province and the CDI values were higher than those on other seasonal and annual scales. Figure 4a indicates that areas with higher CDI values in spring were mainly distributed on the eastern and western boundaries of Guanzhong and in southern Shaanxi (A1 and A2), especially in southeast of Guanzhong and northwest of southern Shaanxi (A2) with an area of more than $2 0 0 0 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ and high CDI values on seasonal and annual scales. In summer, areas with high CDI values were mainly distributed in Yulin (B1) and Shangluo (B2; Fig. 4b). In autumn,areas with high CDI values were located in Yan'an (C1) and Hanzhong (C2; Fig. 4c). On an annual scale, the CDI values in western Yulin (E1) and eastern Shangluo and Weinan (E2; Fig. 4e) were high. However, Figure 4d indicates that the CDI values in winter in the whole region were abnormally high, which is not consistent with the historical drought records (Zhai, 2OO5).

For example, mutations of SPEI-ITPCAS occurred during the period of 199O-2O00 in west of Shaanxi Province and east of Guanzhong in spring (Fig. 7a). In summer, they occurred during the period of 1990-200O in west and middle of Guanzhong (Fig. 7b). In autumn, they appeared after the year 2OOO in north of northern Shaanxi (Fig. 6c). In winter, they occurred after the year 2OOO in east and middle of Guanzhong and in parts of southern Shaanxi (Fig. 7d). On an annual scale, mutations of SPEI-ITPCAS occurred during the period of 1990-2000 in west and middle of Guanzhong,and after the year 2000 in parts of northern Shaanxi (Fig. 7e). In conclusion, the regional and temporal ranges for mutations of SPEI-ITPCAS differed on seasonal and annual scales, and most mutations happened before the year 1990. As Shaanxi Province has three types of terrain with comparably diverse climates (i.e., cold and arid plateau in the north, mild plain in the middle, and wet and warm mountainous regions in the south), the regional responses to climate change varied. The discrepancies of temporal ranges for mutations of SPEI-ITPCAS indicated that the responses of the three sub-regions (northern Shaanxi, Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi) to climate change may be quite different.

Thus, comprehensive evaluations of the existing meteorological datasets in drought monitoring are necessary. Vicente-Serrano et al. (2O1Ob) has proposed a worldwide drought index dataset based on SPEI calculated with $0 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ net CDF reanalysis data. However, it is too coarse for drought monitoring at the provincial scale. ITPCAS, TRMM and CMORPH-PDF (CMORPH calibrated by probability density function matching and optimal interpolation method) are commonly used for provincial drought analysis in China (Tian and Li, 2O15; Lu et al., 2018). ITPCAS has a higher spatial resolution than TRMM and a longer time range than CMORPH. Moreover, numerous studies have shown the superior performance of ITPCAS in predicting precipitation in hydrological simulations in China (Guo and Wang, 2013; He et al., 2O15). Kan et al. (2013) pointed out that the accuracy of spatial distribution of precipitation data derived from ITPCAS for western China was better than those of TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA3B42V6) and CMORPH. In the futureï¼ we will downscale ITPCAS with auxiliary environmental factors to finer resolution so that the spatial-temporal characteristics of drought can be better identified even more precisely.

Precipitation from ITPCAS has been proved to be effective in modelling applications (Wang et al., 2O18). Many scholars have verified that the loglogistic function, which is a probability density function and is used for calculating the SPEI, fits well the distribution of water surplus (Begueria et al., 2O14; Yang et al., 2O16). Therefore, the algorithms used for calculating the PET, including PM equation and Th method, need further evaluation. The error of PET calculated by Th method has been shown to be high in winter (Duan et al., 2013; Parsons et al., 2O19). Figure 4d showed that in Shaanxi Province, the CDI value on the winter scale was abnormally higher than those on other seasonal and annual scales. This anomaly happened because low temperature in winter caused errors in the calculation of PET by Th method. Thus, estimates of PET in winter calculated by Th method need to be adjusted. ",
