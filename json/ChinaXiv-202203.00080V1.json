        "text": "Abstract: Qinghai Lake is the largest saline lake in China.The change in the lake volume is an indicator of the variation in water resources and their response to climate change on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) in China.The present study quantitatively evaluated the effects of climate change and land use/cover change (LUCC)on the lake volume of the Qinghai Lake in China from 1958 to 2018,which is crucial for water resources management in the Qinghai Lake Basin. To explore the effects of climate change and LUCC on the Qinghai Lake volume,we analyzed the lake level observation data and multi-period land use/land cover (LULC) data by using an improved lake volume estimation method and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. Our results showed that the lake level decreased at the rate of $0 . 0 8 ~ \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { a }$ from 1958 to 2004 and increased at the rate of $0 . 1 6 ~ \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { a }$ from 2004 to 2018.The lake volume decreased by $1 0 5 . 4 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ from 1958 to 2004,with the rate of $2 . 2 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ $\\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { a }$ ,whereas it increased by $7 4 . 0 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ from 2004 to 2018,with the rate of $4 . 6 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { a }$ . Further, the climate of the Qinghai Lake Basin changed from warm-dry to warm-humid.From 1958 to 2018, the increase in precipitation and the decrease in evaporation controlled the change of the lake volume,which were the main climatic factors affecting the lake volume change. From 1977 to 2018,the measured water yield showed an \"increase-decrease-increase\" fluctuation in the Qinghai Lake Basin.The effects of climate change and LUCC on the measured water yield were obviously different.From 1977 to 2018,the contribution rate of LUCC was $- 0 . 7 6 \\%$ and that of climate change was $100 . 7 6 \\%$ ；the corresponding rates were $8 . 5 7 \\%$ and $91 . 4 3 \\%$ from 1977 to 2004,respectively,and $- 4 . 2 5 \\%$ and $1 0 4 . 2 5 \\%$ from 2004 to 2018, respectively. Quantitative analysis of the effects and contribution rates of climate change and LUCC on the Qinghai Lake volume revealed the scientific significance of climate change and LUCC,as wellas their individual and combined effects in the Qinghai Lake Basin and on the QTP.This study can contribute to the water resources management and regional sustainable development of the Qinghai Lake Basin.

        "text": "Lakes and other water resources are extremely sensitive to climate change due to global warming and increasing human activities (Adrian et al.，2OO9). These changes considerably affect the ecological environment protection and resource management (Ma et al., 2O1o; Duan and Xiao, 2015; Satgé et al., 2017; Wang and Qin, 2017; Lehnherr et al., 2018; Qiao et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,2019; Yu et al.,2O21). Over the past few decades, the levels of a large number of lakes around the world have dramatically declined, and even some lakes have dried up because of drought (Li et al.,2006; Sellinger et al.,2008; Satgé et al.,2O17; Tal,2O19), which has adversely afected the security and biodiversity of lake ecosystem (da Costa et al.,2O16).In China,lakes are rich in biodiversity but are unevenly distributed. The distribution pattern of lakes has been investigated in detail in various studies (Zhang et al., 2O19). With climate change due to global warming and rapid economic development, the distribution pattern and area of China's lakes have changed, exhibiting divergent regional trends (Tao et al., 2O2O). Although several detailed surveys have been conducted, the factors responsible for causing these changes remain unknown (Zhang et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2O2O). Diverse factors can drive the changes in each lake either individually in the form of natural factors or in the form of human activities or in combination (Cui and Li, 2016).Variations in the lake volume and lake level are the key indicators of the hydrological effects of climate change and land use/cover change (LUCC) (van der Kamp et al., 2OO8; Luo et al.,2020). Furthermore,considerable attention has been paid to the complexity of the interaction between climate change and land use/land cover (LULC) patterns (Piao et al.,2O1O). In the recent decades,the global climate has changed remarkably (Wang et al.,2O18a), which includes changes in the intensity and frequency of precipitation, wind speed,and air temperature (Mendez-Tejeda et al.,2016). In addition, changes in LULC structures, which directly affect evapotranspiration, soil moisture,and groundwater supply， have led to seasonal or long-term imbalance between the inflow and outflow of the lake,thereby causing fluctuations in the lake volume (Rodriguez-Iturbe, 2000； Zohary and Ostrovsky， 2O11). Hydrological station observation and remote sensing technology are generally used to determine variations in the lake volume (Medina et al., 2010; Duan and Bastiaanssen, 2O13;Wang，202O). Lake volume change is estimated based on the difference between the inflow and outflow of the lake from hydrological station observation data (Méndez-Tejeda et al., 2O16). Advanced remote sensing technology, especially satelite altimetry technology，has been widely used in the lake level monitoring in the regions where the hydrological station data are unavailable (Zhang et al.,2O1la).The variation in the lake volume can be estimated by combining the lake area and water balance equation (Medina et al., 2010; Duan and Bastiaanssen, 2013; Zhang et al.,2018;Wang,2020).

        "text": "The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is the highest in the world and referred to as \"the roof of the world\" and \"the third pole\". This region is sensitive to global climate change (Yao et al., 2000).The QTP serves the role of \"the world's water tower\" because water resources in this region are present in the forms of glaciers, snowpacks,lakes,and rivers (Xu et al., 2O08). It is the headstream region of many large rivers that nourish hundreds of millions of people throughout Asia (Qiao et al., 2019). There are more than 12OO alpine lakes with an area greater than $1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ on the QTP (Li et al., 2O19). The variation in the lake volume is of great significance to the hydrological cycle, regional water security, and ecosystem healthy. However, the contributions of driving factors such as precipitation runoff, melt-water runoff,lake surface precipitation,and lake evaporation to the lake volume change vary significantly across different regions (Zhou et al., 2015,2021; Zhong,et al., 2020).

This lake provides not only a suitable habitat for precious birds, fish,and rare animals in China but also important economic,recreational,and aesthetic values to the human society (Xiao et al.,2O18; Kraemer et al.,2O20). Moreover, the water budget of the Qinghai Lake directly reflects the change in water resources and their response to climate change,and thus,it is an important indicator of the response to climate change. The decline in the lake level is a major ecological and environmental problem in the Qinghai Lake Basin,as the lake's ecosystem is extremely fragile and sensitive to global climate change and human activities (Li et al., 2Oo9). Many studies have investigated the changes in the level, volume, and area of the Qinghai Lake,and the response of the lake to climate change (Li, et al.,2OO6; Jin et al.,2010,2013; Zhu et al.,2014; Cui and Li,2016; Wang et al.,2018b; Zhang et al.,2018; Su et al.,2019;Li et al.,202O). During 1961-2012,the Qinghai Lake level first decreased and then increased,and the change in the lake level was mainly affected by precipitation and evaporation (Cui and Li, 2O16). The change in the lake level was strongly and positively correlated with surface runoff and precipitation and negatively correlated with evaporation. Moreover, water consumption due to human activities had a negligible effect on the decline in the lake level (Li et al.,2006).The changing trend of the lake area was consistent with that of the lake level, in which the lake area continued to decrease from 1986 to 2003 and increase from 2003 to 2017 (Han et al., 2019).During 2OO1-2O16,the lake volume also showed an increasing trend that was driven by increased precipitation and decreased evaporation (Zhang et al., 2018).

        "text": "Climate change exerts strong effects on most large lakes (Kraemer et al., 2O2O). Qinghai Lake is located at the intersection of East Asian monsoon, Indian monsoon,and westerly atmospheric flow (Li et al., 2Oo6). The mechanism of the effects of climate change on the lake volume is complex，and the seasonal difference in the lake volume is obvious (Lei et al.，2017). Nevertheless,the contributions of glaciers,snow,and permafrost to the lake volume remain to be further studied. A large area of continuous permafrost was distributed in the Qinghai Lake Basin. However, with global warming, permafrost has been undergoing rapid degradation. Analysis of the ground surface temperature indicated that the warming of the active layer was significant (Li et al.,202O).Li et al. (2O19) estimated that the ground ice reserves of permafrost was $1 6 0 . 0 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ $\\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ at the depth of $0 { - } 1 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in the Qinghai Lake Basin,and the volume of water released by the upper layer of permafrost ground ice thawing in the recent ten years was $2 7 . 2 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ The distribution area of glaciers is relatively small in the Qinghai Lake Basin.The estimated glacial ice reserve was $4 9 . 0 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ in 2015,and the glacier loss was $2 . 9 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ in the past decade (Li et al.,2O19). However, different views exist on glacier meltwater feeding rivers. According to Zhang et al. (2O1lb),the increase in the lake water level in 2O04 could be attributed to the accelerated glacier and snow cover melting in the recent decades. By the study of hydrogen-oxygen isotope change, Jin et al. (2O13) asserted that glacial melting is limited to river recharge.With the aggravation of the lack of water resources in the future,lakes are likely to become an important water resource.The lake levels are stillikely to undergo changes because of climate change and human activities (Kraemer et al.,2O2O),and these factors can increase the risk of water resource crises in China (Tao et al.,2O2O). Therefore,the coupling mechanism of climate change and lake volume should be further studied. Quantitative analyses of the contributions of glaciers, permafrost, snow cover,and precipitation to lake water resources,as well as the risk due to human activities are crucial for the management and sustainable utilization of water resources in the Qinghai Lake Basin.

        "text": "Based on the lake level data of the Qinghai Lake，we introduced an improved lake volume calculation method to analyze the long-term trends of the lake volume change. By using a combination of the long-term series climatic data and multi-period LULC data, we quantitatively evaluated the contributions of climate change and LUCC to the measured water yield of the Qinghai Lake,which indirectly reflected the effects of climate change and LUCC on the lake volume.The results indicated that the volume of the Qinghai Lake changed significantly from 1958 to 2O18. Specifically, the lake volume decreased by $1 0 5 . 4 0 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ from 1958 to 2004,at the rate of $2 . 2 4 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { a }$ ，and increased by $7 4 . 0 2 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ from 2004 to 2018,at the rate of $4 . 6 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { a }$ .The effects of climate change and LUCC on the lake volume of the Qinghai Lake were significantly different.

        "text": "In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the effects of climate change and LUCC on the lake volume change but did not consider the effect of LUCC on climate regulation.In our further study, we will comprehensively consider the coupling effect between climate change and LUCC, the re-change of the lake volume by precipitation, permafrost ground ice,and groundwater, and the prediction study of the lake volume change under the background of global warming. It is our hope that this study can serve as a suitable scientific guide for the sustainable management and development of water resources in the Qinghai Lake Basin as well as on the QTP. ",
