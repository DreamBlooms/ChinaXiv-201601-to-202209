In order to make the energy of the calculated runaway electrons more accurate, we take the shafranov shift into account. The results of the analysis show that the synchrotron radiation intensity and energy of runaway electrons did not reach the maximum at the same time. The energy of runaway electrons reached the maximum value first,and then the synchrotron radiation intensity of the runaway electrons reached the maximum. We also analyzed the runaway electrons density,and it shows the density of runaway electrons continuously increased.For this reason,although the energy of the runaway electrons drops but the synchrotron radiation intensity of the runaway electrons will continue rising for a while.

The energy of the runaway electrons rose before 1.48s and then decreased.The decrease of runaway electron energy is due to the increase of plasma density, which leads to the increase of drag and the decrease of loop voltage, resulting in the decrease of power.
