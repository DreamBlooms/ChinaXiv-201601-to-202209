Figure 18 illustrates the general photometric scheme.The detections are based on both SDSS and SCUSS images.We perform aperture,PSF,model, and automatic photometry for the stacked images.Note that the automatic magnitudes are only based on objects solely detected by SExtractor. We also obtain co-added aperture,PSF,and model magnitudes from photometry of single-epoch images. Since point sources can be best modeled while extended sources are much more complicated, the photometry of pointlike objects is better suited for comparisons of our different photometric methods.Thus,the comparisons of point sources are presented for most cases below and, for comparison with SDSS，we correct the magnitude with the SCUSS/SDSS color term.
