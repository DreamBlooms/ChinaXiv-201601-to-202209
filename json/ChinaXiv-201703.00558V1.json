In addition, He et al.[23] and Nowotny et al.24] had clarified that the annealed samples in vacuum existed a good deal of oxygen vacancies and few titanium vacancies.

Fig. 3(b） shows the annealing-fluence-dependent magnetization of $\\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ single crystals after subtracting diamagnetic background.
