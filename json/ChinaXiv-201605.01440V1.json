Because S-layer proteins self-assemble into a native-like S-layer crystalline structure in vitro, they are attractive building blocks in nanotechnology. Here, the potential use of the S-layer protein EAl from Bacillus anthracis in constructing a functional nanostructure is investigated, and apply this nanostructure in a proof-of-principle study for serological diagnosis of anthrax. EAl is genetically fused with methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH),to degrade methyl parathion and provide a label for signal amplification. EAl not only serves as a nanocarrier, but also as a specific antigen to capture anthrax-specific antibodies. As results, purified EAl-MPH forms a single layer of crystalline nanostructure through self-assembly. Our chimeric nanocatalyst greatly improves enzymatic stability of MPH. When applied to the detection of anthraxspecific antibodies in serum samples, the detection of our EAl-MPH nanostructure is nearly 300 times more sensitive than that of the unassembled complex. Together, it is shown that it is possible to build a functional and highly sensitive nanosensor based on S-layer protein. In conclusion, our present study should serve as a model for the development of other multifunctional nanomaterials using S-layer proteins. ",
