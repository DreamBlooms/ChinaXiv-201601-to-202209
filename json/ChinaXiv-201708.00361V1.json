A field-theoretic computation of the latter was later performed in [34].

This is usually referred to as the maximal transcendentality principle; see also [7, 52-54] for further discussions. While this heuristic relation was observed only for anomalous dimensions,in [8] it was found that the remainder function of certain BPS two-loop form factors matches exactly the leading transcendental part of related two-loop Higgs-to-gluons amplitudes in QCD [55].

We have disentangled the UV divergences from the IR divergences using the BDS ansatz and the universality of the latter. Because of the operator mixing, we needed to promote the interactions to operators and the iterative structure of the BDS ansatz to an operatorial form as well. From the UV divergences, we have determined the renormalisation constants and the dilatation operator. ",

As already observed in [14] for the BPS case, soft and colinear limits of minimal form factors also do not vanish for the cases considered here. This may be surprising since a priori there is no physical interpretation for this limit because these form factors correspond to the minimal physical configuration. Actually, similar questions also appear at the amplitude level. For example,taking certain soft or colinear limits of the sixscalar amplitudes given in appendix A does not generate any physical amplitude, though the limit is non-zero. Via unitarity cuts, this consideration on the level of amplitudes affects the limits of minimal form factors.
