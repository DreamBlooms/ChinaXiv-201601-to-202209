The sensitivity is more than 1oO-fold higher than the standard colloidal gold strip.Employing this method,as low as $2 4 0 \\mathrm { p f u / m L }$ pseudo-EBOV can be rapidly detected within $3 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ ，which is comparable with the ELISA method (Daaboul et al., 2014;Ksiazek et al.,1992;Towner et al.,2004). This Nanozyme-strip is based on our previously findings that MNPs possess intrinsic peroxidaselike activity,catalyzing peroxidase substrates and producing an obvious color reaction，which is similar to that of natural peroxidase enzymes (Gao et al.,2Oo7). This type of catalytic inorganic nanomaterial has been termed a nanozyme (Wei and Wang,2O13).Because of their stability,low cost,and ability to be reused,nanozymes have been widely applied in biomedical detection and environmental analysis (Fan et al.,2O12；Liang et al., 2013； Zhuang et al.,2012). In this study,we applied MNPs as a nanozyme probe in place of colloidal gold nanoparticles.After labeling with anti-EBOV antibody,this novel probe is able to recognize,separate,and visualize EBOV on the strip.Owing to the catalytic properties of the probe,the detection sensitivity of the Nanozyme-strip was significantly improved without the need for any special equipment.Given its high sensitivity and simplicity, this novel assay represents a suitable diagnostic tool for Ebolastricken areas.

Owing to the intrinsic nanozyme activity,this probe can generate a color reaction by catalyzing the reaction with peroxide substrates (Gao et al.,2oo7),which significantly enhances the signal on the strip(Fig.1).The amplified signals are very important especially for the trace detection of EBOV.Because of the intrinsic magnetic property of the nanozyme probe,further improvement in sensitivity can be achieved by adding an immunomagnetic separation step.The Nanozyme-strip, with high sensitivity comparable to ELISA,is rapid,simple,and visible to the naked-eye without the need for any special equipment,making ita valuable diagnostic tool for EVDdetection.

First,we prepared the mouse anti-EBOV antibodies (Qiu et al.,2011). Since the GP of EBOV is the key target for EBOV detection and therapy (Sanchez et al.，1999; Yang et al.，200O)，we utilized the recombinant GP as the antigen to produce monoclonal antibodies. The clones 1H3,2G4 and 4G7,which also compose the ZMAb used to treat EVD in nonhuman primates (Qiu et al.,2012,2014),were selected as candidates.All these three antibodies exhibited high binding affinity for EBOV-GP(Fig.2A).To test whether two of these three antibodies could form a sandwich-type complex with EBOV-GP,an ELISA binding analysis was performed.We found the binding site of 1H3 was complementary to 2G4 and 4G7,while the binding sites of 2G4 and 4G7 overlap (Fig.S2),which is also confirmed by Audet et al.(2014). Therefore,we chose 1H3 as a capture antibody for EBOV detection.Based on this result,both 2G4 and 4G7 could be used as the detection antibody in sandwich ELISA analysis for EBOV detection (Fig.2B).As 4G7 exhibited higher sensitivity for EBOV-GP,we chose 4G7 as the detection antibody.
