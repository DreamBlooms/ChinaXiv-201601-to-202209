        "text": "Abstract: Snow resisting capacity of vegetation is important for secondary distribution of water resources in seasonal snow areas of grassland because it afects the regeneration, growth and nutrient circulation of vegetation in grassland. This study investigated vegetation characteristics (canopy height, canopy length and crown width) of Caragana micropbyll Lam. (shrub)and Achnatberum splendens (Trin.)Nevski. (herb),and snow morphologies (snow depth, snow width and snow braid length) in a typical steppe region of Inner Mongolia, China in 2017.And the influence of vegetation characteristic on snow resisting capacity (the indices of bottom area of snow and snow volume reflect snow resisting capacity) was analyzed. The results showed that snow morphology depends on vegetation characteristics of shrub and herb. The canopy height was found to have the greatest influence on snow depth and the crown width had the greatest influence on snow width. The canopy length was found to have litle influence on morphological parameters of snow. When the windward areas of $C .$ micropbylla and $\\boldsymbol { \\mathcal { A } }$ ，splendens were within the ranges of $0 . 0 { - } 0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ and $0 . 0 { - } 8 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ ，respectively, the variation of snow cover was large; however,beyond these areas, the variation of snow cover became gradually stable. The potential area of snow retardation for a single plant was $1 . 5 { - } 2 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ and the amount of snow resistance was $0 . 1 5 { - } 0 . 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ . The bottom area of snow and snow volume (i.e., snow resisting capacity) of clumped $C .$ microphylla and $A .$ splendens was found to be 4 and 25 times that of individual plant,respectively. The results could provide a theoretical basis both for the estimation of snow cover and the establishment of a plant-based technical system for the control of windblown snow in the typical steppe region of Inner Mongolia.

        "text": "Seasonal snow cover is an important fresh water resource in grassland (Conner et al., 2O17). The effects of wind protection, snow blocking and snow retention by vegetation can cause drifting to form secondary accumulation of snow on the leeward side of shrubs and herbs,such that the snow cover could be redistributed within a certain space (Leonard and Maksym, 2O11). Topography, wind force,snow source and shrub-herb characteristics can affect the range of disturbance, potential range of snow cover and snow resisting capacity (Sturm et al.，2Oo1；Essery and Pomeroy, 20O4; Pomeroy et al.,2006). The amount of snow accumulation determines the time of reviving of herb vegetation in the folowing year, ground temperature, speed of vegetation growth and development and biomass (Fan et al.,2013;Tommaso et al.,2014).Moreover, the formation of snow in association with shrubs and herbs is important for plant species composition, vegetation structure，soil carbon storage， surface water geochemistry， decomposition，invertebrate and vertebrate populations and the spectral reflection of vegetation (Walker et al.,1995; Marion et al., 1997; Johansson et al.,2013; Gavazov et al., 2017).

        "text": "The relationship between snow morphology and vegetation characteristics in steppe regions is complex (Myers-Smith, 2011; Naito and Cairns, 2011). The hydrological processes (e.g.,snow cover，distribution and ablation） of grassland areas are considerably affected by vegetation characteristics (Marsh et al.,2010; Liston and Hiemstra, 2011). On the contrary, snow cover can affect the physiological and ecological processes of vegetation in steppe regions, e.g. snow cover is known to have significant correlation with vegetation growth in the succeeding year (Jones et al.,2001; Halinger et al.,2010; Schmidt et al.,2010; Wipf and Rixen, 2010; Cacitua et al., 2013). Based on field observation and numerical simulation, researchers have preliminarily found the status and the function of snow cover affecting by vegetation. For example,using the CLM4 (community land model 4) and CAM4 (community atmosphere model 4) models, Lawrence et al. (2011） found that a $20 \\%$ increase in vegetation density could lead to a corresponding $4 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ increase in snow depth. Field observations indicated that the process of snow accumulation is controlled by blocking of wind and blowing snow. For example,Dolman et al. (2Oo1) found that snow depth in areas of tundra shrub is about $27 \\%$ higher than in areas of herb,and that a slight increase in shrub canopy height could cause a remarkable increase in snow depth. Pomeroy et al. (1997） found that snow depth in areas of arctic shrub was 4-5 times that of areas of sparse vegetation. Sturm et al. (2OO5) also found that vegetation height significantly affected snow depth, and that snow depth in areas of shrub was higher than in areas of no vegetation.And individual patches of shrub and the edges of larger areas of vegetation can serve as a depository for windblown snow by intercepting large amounts of snow blown from the tundra. The snow resisting capacity of vegetation is of great importance for the control of snow-related damage in steppe regions in winter. ",

However, the inversion accuracy is considerably affected by vegetation，especially shrub,and it has been confirmed that shrub is the biggest source of uncertainty in the extraction of snow-related parameters (Cornelissen and Makoto,2O14; Tinkham et al., 2014). Moreover, snow resisting capacity of shrubs and herbs has not been studied in depth. In this study, we used bottom area of snow and snow volume to reflect the snow resisting capacity of shrubs and herbs. ",

In areas of alpine tundra, the height and canopy breadth of shrubs significantly affect snow depth,and the snow depth in the area with shrub in the Arctic is 4-5 times that of areas with sparse vegetation (Pomeroy et al.，1997). Similar results found that the snow morphological characteristics during accumulation process in cold regions can be significantly altered by variations in height and coverage of shrubs (Menard et al.,2O14).In this study,we found that crown width has significant influence on snow morphology $( R ^ { 2 } { > } 0 . 7 5 )$ ，while canopy length has little influence. This result can be used to select the plant species with large crown width for improving the capacity of resisting snow damage. ",

If the baseline of snow water equivalent is taken as the monitored snow water equivalent in a stubble field of the peneplain, the relative snow water equivalent of grazed grassland was 0.60,ungrazed grassland was 2.85 and shrubland was 4.2O (Gray,1979). The result implied that the influence of shrub on snow cover was higher than that of grass.Meanwhile, observations have revealed a significant correlation of vegetation parameters of shrubs and herbs with snow depth.It has been found that the amount of snow on shrub is greater than that of on grass.The result of this study showed that there was a significant correlation between vegetation parameters of both $C .$ ，microphylla and $A$ . splendens and snow morphology.

        "text": "Snow and sand accumulation in association with shrubs and herbs are products of snow drifting and windblown sand transport and accumulation,and snow drifting and windblown sand that both represent dual phase gas-solid flow have similar migration trends. Snow grains are more viscous than sand grains; therefore,it is easier for snow to accumulate on the leward side of shrubs and herbs (Musick and Gillte,1996; Yan et al., 2O18). In studying the mechanism of prevention of snow movement by shrubs and herbs,lessons can be drawn from studies of the similar mechanism associated with windblown sand and vegetation. When windblown sand approaches an individual shrub or herb specimen,a deceleration zone is formed in front of the shrub or herb and a portion of the sand is deposited. Concurrently,acceleration zones are formed on either side and above the plant. On the leeward side of the plant, the wind speed decreases rapidly because of the eddy effect and a low-speed zone is formed.Beyond a certain distance downwind of the plant, the wind speed gradually recovers in a wake area, causing sand particles to be deposited (Ash and Wasson，1983；Frank and Kocurek，1996；Walker and Nickling，2002). The vegetation morphology and wind field characteristics determined the observations and analytical results of this study， verifying the similarity of the mechanism of accumulation of sand and snow in association with shrubs and herbs. Therefore,the bottom area of snow partly and indirectly reflects the snow resisting capacity of the shrubs and herbs,and the snow volume directly reflects the snow amount covered by the shrubs and herbs. Both of them determine the snow resisting capacity of the shrubs and herbs. ",

When a single plant is in a line perpendicular to the direction of prevailing wind, the blocking range to the wind will be increased and sediment of snowdrift willbe deposited on the leeward side. However, when the plant grew in the downwind direction, although the plant coverage might increase, its blocking range is less changed. Thus, any increase in its ability to resist wind and snow accumulate willbe minimal. However, when the plant grew in clumps,both the coverage and the density of plant will increase,and its blocking range to wind and its capacity to snow accumulate will significantly increase.Thus,this type of vegetation has the greatest capacity to resist wind and sediment. Similarly to this study, we found that the potential snow area and snow volume retarded in type D were respectively 4 and 25 times that of a single plant, indicating that the clumped distribution of vegetation had the greatest capacity of resisting snow in four types of vegetation.
