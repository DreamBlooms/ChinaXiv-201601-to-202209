Based on the structural prediction, the coordination number of ${ \\mathbf { A } } { \\mathbf { g } } ^ { + }$ and the scheme of the $[ \\mathrm { A g O _ { \\mathrm { x } } } ]$ group as a function of pressure were obtained and are shown in Figure 4c.Apparently，the silver coordination of the Trigonal-I phase is equal to that of the cubic phase,but varies the $\\mathrm { [ A g O _ { 4 } ] }$ structure and breaks its centrosymmetry.When pressure rises up to $4 4 \\mathrm { G P a }$ the silver coordination increases from 4 to 7,accompanying the growing complexity of the $[ \\mathrm { A g O _ { \\mathrm { x } } } ]$ configuration.

The SSW algorithm has an automated climbing mechanism to drive an atomic configuration from a local energy-minimum state to a high-energy configuration along random directions,inheriting the idea of the bias-potential driven constrained-Broyden-dimer (BP-CBD method for the transition-state (TS)location.55 Three steps are involved for finding the lowest energy pathway，as described below briefly.(i) Pathway collection In SSW pathway sampling,first,we start from one single phase (starting phase),and utilize the SSW method to explore all the likely phases nearby the phase.A structure selection module is utilized to decide whether to accept/refuse once a new minimum is reached.If the new phase that is different from the starting phase is identified by the SSW crystal method56,we record/output the IS (i.e. starting phase) and the FS (a new phase) of the current SSW step.Then, the program will return to the IS by rejecting the new minimum to continue the phase exploration; On the other hand,if the new minimum identified by SSW is still the starting phase (e.g.,the same symmetry but a permutation isomer with varied lattice),the program will accept the new isomeric phase and start the phase exploration from this phase.We repeated this procedure until a certain number of IS/FS pairs were reached.(ii) Pathway screening Secondly，we utilized the variable-cell double-ended surface walking (DESW) method57 to establish the pseudopathway connecting IS to FS for all IS/FS pairs58.59.The approximate barrier is obtained according to DESW pseudopathway，where the maximum energy point along the pathway is generally a good estimate for the true $\\mathrm { T S } ^ { 5 7 }$ .By sorting the approximate barrier height,we can obtain the candidates for the lowest energy pathways. (ii) Lowest energy pathway determination Thirdly, the candidate lowest energy pathways are selected to exactly locate the true TS by using the DESW TS-search method57.By sorting the exact barrier calculated,the energy difference between the TS and the IS,the lowest energy pathways could be finally obtained.All the lowest energy pathways will be further confirmed by extrapolating TS towards IS and FS, and the TSs need to be validated by phonon spectrum calculation, showing one and only one imaginary mode.In this study,we explore the structural transformation between the cubic $\\mathrm { \\bf A g _ { 3 } P O _ { 4 } }$ phase and the high-pressure $\\mathrm { \\sf A g _ { 3 } P O _ { 4 } }$ phases,using the SSW method.Based on the sampled free energy landscape,the pathways connecting the initial structure and the final structure on the potential energy surface can be determined in an atom-toatom correspondence,and we further export the pathway by the nudged elastic band (NEB) methodo.
