        "text": "Abstract: Long-term monitoring of the ecological environment changes is helpful for the protection of the ecological environment. Based on the ecological environment of the Sahel region in Africa, we established a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model for this region by combining dryness, moisture, greenness, and desertification indicators. Using the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform,this study analyzed the ecological environment quality of the Sahel region during the period of 2001-2020. We used liner regresson and fluctuation analysis methods to study the trend and fluctuation of RSEI,and utilized the stepwise regression approach to analyze the contribution of each indicator to the RSEI. Further,the correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between RSEI and precipitation,and Hurst index was applied to evaluate the change trend of RSEI in the future. The results show that RSEI of the Sahel region exhibited spatial heterogeneity. Specifically,it exhibited a decrease in gradient from south to north of the Sahel region. Moreover,RSEI in parts of the Sahel region presented non-zonal features.Diferent land-cover types demonstrated different RSEI values and changing trends. We found that RSEI and precipitation were positively correlated,suggesting that precipitation is the controlling factor of RSEI. The areas where RSEI values presented an increasing trend were slightly less than the areas where RSEI values presented a decreasing trend.In the Sahel region, the areas with the ecological environment characterized by continuous deterioration and continuous improvement accounted for $4 4 . 0 2 \\%$ and $2 8 . 2 9 \\%$ of the total study area,respectively，and the areas in which the ecological environment was changing from improvement to deterioration and from deterioration to improvement accounted for $12 . 4 2 \\%$ and $1 5 . 2 6 \\%$ of the whole area, respectively. In the face of the current ecological environment and future change trends of RSEI in the Sahel region, the research results provide a reference for the construction of the \"Green Great Wall\" (GGW) ecological environment project in Africa.

Advances in science and technology provide a basis for monitoring the variability of the Earth's ecological environment and its possble responses to changes in anthropogenic and natural conditions (Moss et al.， 2O1O). Such advances can contribute to improving our understanding of the operating mechanism of the Earth's systems by monitoring long-term ecological environment changes,indicating the response of the ecological environment to more intense human activities (Qureshi et al.,2O2O),and can assist in efforts to minimize the negative impact of global changes on human survival and development (Ji et al., 2020).

Due to the different research themes of scholars,there are many differences in the definition of ecological environment quality (Miao et al.，2O16; Jing et al.，2O2O). Based on relevant researches,we define the ecological environment quality as the degree of suitability for the survival of living organisms in this study. ",

Xu (2013） proposed to monitor and evaluate the ecological environment quality by obtaining remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) through RS technology. At present, many scholars have used RSEI to evaluate the ecological environment quality of different regions.For example,Xu et al. (2O019） quantified and monitored the ecological environment changes in Fujian Province of China based on the change vector analysis method and four ecological indicators (i.e.,moisture，greenness,heat,and dryness). Liao and Jiang (2020) established China's RSEI model, based on four indicators (moisture,greenness, heat, and dryness). They monitored the overall ecological environment quality of China from 2Oo0 to 2017 and found that drought was the most important factor affecting the ecological environment quality (Liao and Jiang, 2020).

        "text": "Changes in the ecological environment are usually accompanied by variations of the whole environment, including changes in the surface vegetation, temperature,and soil moisture (Walther et al.,2O02； Zheng et al., 2O2O). Therefore,a comprehensive evaluation of multiple indicators should be included when RS is used to monitor the ecological environment changes. However, previous research has mostly used moisture, greenness, heat,and dryness as evaluation indicators, while ignored the diversity of the ecological environment (Xiong et al.,2O2O). Different ecological environments should be evaluated with different indicators. Moreover,data loss occurs easily because RS images are limited by bad weather conditions (Steven et al.,1998; Zhang et al.,2020). In addition, some research areas are relatively broad,and images with intervals of 5 or 1O a are often selected for RSEI evaluation to reduce the experimental workload (Fan et al.，2020). However, owing to the influence of data selection,variations in the surface features,and extreme climate events,changes in the ecological environment can be easily misjudged (Hang et al.,2O2O). In the past, single ecological factor was used to evaluate the ecological environment quality, such as the vegetation index (Dardel et al., 2014), soil moisture index (Gu et al., 2019), precipitation (Dai, 2011),and temperature (Wu et al.， 2O2O). There are few studies about the overall ecological environment of the Sahel region. Based on the RSEI model, this paper comprehensively assessed the ecological environment quality of the Sahel region. ",

The Sahel region is a Zone between the Sahara Desert and Savanna. Its ecological environment is very fragile,and it is extremely sensitive to climate change and human activities (Held et al., 2OO5; Issa et al.,2014). Severe desertification occurs in the Sahel region owing to the harsh ecological environment. The \"Green Great Wall\" (GGW) ecological environment project of the Sahel region was proposed to combat desertification, which aimed to construct a tree belt from the west to the east of Africa (Goffner et al., 2O19).The shelterbelt intends to adjust the temperature along the pathway,reduce the rate of wind erosion of soil, and increase the moisture of the local microclimate (Wade et al., 2018; You et al., 2019).

The area of the Sahel region is mostly divided by annual precipitation.

This region has a dry climate and frequent sandstorms.Due to the rapid growth of population,farmland and pastoral areas are continuously expanding,resulting in ecological environment deterioration and spread of desertification (Tucker et al.，1985; Scheffer et al., 2O01). The conception of the GGW was introduced to manage the ecological environmental conditions caused by climate change and human activities in the Sahel region,which was later gradually developed into the current GGW ecological environment project (Goffner et al., 2O19). The latitude of the areas of the GGW ecological environment project is similar to that of the Sahel region of Africa.

To ensure that the regresson equation contained only the variables with significant influence on dependent variable prior to the introduction of new variables,each variable that was introduced or removed from the regression equation was subject to the $F$ test.In this study,we used this method to deduce and test the four indicators that affected the RSEI,eliminate insignificant variables,and establish the RSEI model in the Sahel region.

However, some areas demonstrated non-zonal characteristics.For example, RSEI value near the Lake Chad was higher than that at the same latitude area due to the humid microclimate in the Lake Chad (where there is an abundance of vegetation). Meanwhile,RSEI value of the eastern Nile River region was high due to the large cultivated land area. As a result, the eastern Nile River region had higher greenness and moisture degrees and lower desertification and dryness degrees.Here，we selected regions A $( 1 3 ^ { \\circ } 3 5 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { N }$ ， $3 0 ^ { \\circ } 4 4 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { E }$ ；Sudan)，B( $1 4 ^ { \\circ } 5 0 \\mathrm { N } .$ ， $1 5 ^ { \\circ } 1 0 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { W }$ ； Senegal)， and C( $\\mathrm { 1 1 ^ { \\circ } 0 6 ^ { \\prime } N }$ ， $3 4 ^ { \\circ } 3 9 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { E }$ ； Sudan) shown in Figure 4 to analyze the RSEI characteristics according to the high spatial resolution images (Fig. 5) obtained from the Google Earth software (Google Inc., Mountain View, California, America).

Regions A, B,and C represented completely different ecological environments,and the RSEI results also supported this conclusion.

The current method of RSEI is considered more reasonable than a single indicator for the ecological environment assessment (Liu et al.,2019; Gao et al.,202O; Ji et al.,2020). However, owing to diferent ecological environment types,using constant indicators to evaluate different ecological landscape changes may cause deviations or errors. Thus,we selected the evaluation indicators for different ecological conditions to evaluate the ecological environment of the Sahel region. Because the Sahel region is a semi-arid region with severe desertification (Wu et al., 2020), we added the RDDI (which represents the degree of desertification) into the RSEI model. The Sahel region has few large-scale urban agglomerations located in the tropical areas where there is less disturbance from human activities； therefore，we removed heat indicator from the original RSEI model.

The Sahel region is a transitional region between Sahara Desert and Savanna. The northern part, which is in the vicinity of the Sahara Desert, is sparsely vegetated, and the land is highly exposed with severe desertification and poor soil moisture,while the southern part of the Sahel region exhibits the opposite characteristics (Foley et al.,2OO3; Lee et al.,2O15).Notably,the gradient-trend of RSEI from north to south has been disturbed in some regions,such as the Lake Chad and the eastern part of the Nile River. Aquatic vegetation is abundant in the vicinity of the Lake Chad (Leblanc et al., 2O11), improving the greenness indicator in the RSEI model.Moreover, the high soil moisture of the land around the lake improves the moisture indicator in the RSEI model, correspondingly reducing the degrees of desertification and dryness.There are substantial cultivated lands in the eastern region of the Nile River,and we selected the RS data in the crop-growing season from May to October for analysis. The NDVI and RSEI values of the above regions were obviously higher than those of the regions with the same latitudes. The order of RSEI values for different land-cover types decreased as follows: wetland>forest>shrubland>cultivated land>grassland>artificial surface>bare land. The indicators of the RSEI model were dryness, moisture, greenness,and desertification; among which, WETI and NDVI were positive indicators，while RDDI and NDSI were negative indicators. Wetland had high WETI and NDVI values, while NDSI and RDDI values were lowest among the land-cover types. On the contrary,each indicator of bare land was the opposite to that of wetland; therefore,RSEI of bare land reached the lowest value.The RSEI of grassand,forest,and cultivated land showed an interannual decline trend,which may be related to human grazing activities, deforestation, and excessive reclamation of wasteland for agricultural production (van Keulen and Breman,199O; Mainali,2OO6; Epule etal.,2O14).The RSEI of wetland,shrubland,and artificial surface showed an interannual upward trend; the reasons may be related to the construction of greening projects and climate change (Fensholt et al.， 2012； Abiodun et al., 2013).

The forest with a high reduction of RSEI may be related to the decrease of woody plant coverage caused by the increased grazing and wood demand (Leroux et al.,2O17).

In arid and semi-arid areas, the change of precipitation will significantly affect the local ecosystem，and an increase of precipitation is generally conducive to improving the ecological environment (Fensholt et al., 2O12; Xu et al., 2020).The RSEI fluctuations in the Sahel region showed obvious spatial heterogeneity,and the CV values of RSEI in the northern region were significantly greater than those in the southern region, which was likely related to precipitation fluctuations. Figure 14 shows that the CV values of precipitation in the northern region of the Sahel region was larger than those in the southern region. Among the four indicators,moisture indicator was directly related to precipitation. The Sahel region is characterized by a semi-arid climate，and precipitation is a key factor restricting vegetation growth (Huber et al., 2O11; Fensholt et al.,2O13). Therefore,the fluctuation in annual precipitation had an important influence on the fluctuation of RSEI values.The areas where RSEI increased were smaller than the areas where RSEI decreased. Figures 1O and 15 show similar trends in RSEI and precipitation. However, some differences remained in local areas.For example, because population in Burkina Faso increased by $56 . 0 0 \\%$ since 2000 (i.e., from $1 1 . 6 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ in 2000 to $1 8 . 1 0 \\dot { \\times } \\dot { 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ in 2015) (FAO,201O), the ecological environment of the northern region showed a deteriorating trend. The rapidly growing population has placed great pressure on agriculture (Knauer et al., 2O17). Meanwhile, inadequate land management and agricultural activities have also largely contributed to land degradation in Burkina Faso(Knauer et al.,2O17). We found that RSEI in the Sahel region was largely dependent on the moisture indicator, which confirmed that precipitation was a key factor affecting the ecological environment changes in arid and semi-arid areas to some extent (Fensholt et al.,2Ol2).Prediction of the ecological environment in the Sahel region shows that the ecological environment of the western Sahel region will continue to deteriorate in the future.

First, RESI can observe the changes in the ecological environment; however,the attribution of its change trend can only be expressed qualitatively(rather than quantitatively)by measuring the corresponding \"contributions\" of human activities and climate change. Second, specific land-cover types will directly affect the monitoring of RSEI in the Sahel region.For example,a large area of water will directly affect the moisture indicator in the RSEI model. When the cultivated land changed at different periods, such as the area with high vegetation coverage prior to crop harvesting,the positive indicator of RSEI is larger; however, if there is a large amount of bare land after crop harvesting, the positive indicator will decrease,thus affecting RSEI.At the same time, when the wasteland is reclaimed for farmland and shelterbelt is planted, their NDVI will increase in a short time and the RSEI will also increase correspondingly (Estel et al.,2015; Mark,2019; Zhou et al.,202O). However, the increase of RSEI is at the cost of consuming groundwater and fertility，which will cause damages to the original ecological environment. Future research should be combined with field investigations to clarify the phenological changes with different land-cover types and select specific periods for future RSEI observations.Moreover, the atribution analysis of RSEI changes is also very important.
