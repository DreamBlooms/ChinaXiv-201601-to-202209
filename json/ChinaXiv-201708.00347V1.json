In the last years, there have been many preeminent works concerning this subject in nucleus, including both theoretical calculations[1， 2, 3, 4] and experimental results[5, 6]. Particularly, two symmetries at the critical points of shape phase transition, called E(5) and X(5)， have recently been proposed[7, 8]. It is a major breakthrough in the study of critical point behavior of nucleus undergoing a shape phase transition because it gives us simple analytic solutions while historically we have to resort to numerical calculations to describe such nucleus.

These examples show that the obtained new symmetries represent a helpful theoretical tool which could well describe the structure of the realistic nucleus at the critical point of a shape transition, in a sense complementing the role played by the dynamical symmetries of the Interacting Boson Model(IBM)[16,17]. However, there remain some interesting aspects on the statistical properties of the E(5) and X(5） symmetries. (1) Whether the nuclear system displays ordered or chaotic spectrum in the new symmetries? (2) Does the statistics give a strong evidence to support that the obtained new symmetries can well describe the nucleus at the critical point in a shape transition? (3) The new symmetries are based on the particular potential amenable to analytic descriptions which well approximate to the “true” potential. Does the simplification of the potential eliminates part of the statistical properties of the realistic nucleus at the critical point? Or more concretely, are the results consistent with the statistical properties obtained by Alhassid and collaborates[18,19, 20] in the framework of IBM? Therefore it is crucially important to obtain the statistics of the new symmetries and answer the above opening questions. In this sense,we explore the statistical properties of E(5) and X(5) symmetries in the paper. ",

Since the X(5) symmetry is obtained around $\\gamma = 0$ [8],the corresponding restriction in $\\gamma$ by the total energy must be very small. Taking this small value of $\\gamma$ as O.1,we then work out that the strength of the two dimensional oscillator(3 $a$ ） must be more than 1O according to the formulation $U _ { \\gamma } = ( 3 a ) ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } / 2$ .

We can easily find that the energy eigenvalues in the $\\mathrm { X } ( 5 )$ symmetry contain two terms, one is the square of the zeros of the Bessel function in $\\beta$ , another is the solution of two dimensional oscillator function in $\\gamma$ . In order to display how the relative strength of the two terms afects the energy level statistics,we calculate the statistics in different values of the relative strength $A / B$ ， the results are displayed in Fig.2. All of the relative strength $A / B$ satisfy the condition （20 $A / B \\geq 1 6$ as we estimated above. It is apparent that when the parameter $A / B$ is not very large, two maxima[25] appear in the NSD statistics (see the left part of Fig.2. (a),(b)), which is rather different from the fluctuation properties in other cases except for those in the U(5） dynamical symmetry with collective backbending[25, 26]. In theoretical point of view,the X(5) symmetry describes the critical point nuclei in a spherical to axially deformed shape phase transition analytically. The structure of its energy levels must be not the same everywhere. In fact, the term $B ( \\chi _ { s , L } ) ^ { 2 }$ is approximately a rotational term of $s$ ，whereas the term $A n _ { \\gamma }$ is a vibrational term of $n _ { \\gamma }$ . The simultaneous appearance of these two terms induces a competition and makes the ensemble with the same angular momentum $L$ and its projection on the symmetry axis $K$ involves two sequences, one of which is in vibration, another is in rotation. When we unfold the above spectrum $\\{ E _ { i } ( L ) \\}$ ， the two sequences are normalized with an unique total average spacing, and their maxima in the spacing distributions are no longer the same, consequently two maxima emerge because of the uniform unfolding procedure. The same mechanism and results can be found in U(5) dynamical symmetry with collctive backbending, where the the structure of the yrast band changes from the U(5) vibrational states to the rotational states with full d-boson number $n _ { d } = N$ ， which implies that a transition of collective motion mode may happen as the angular momentum increases. In this statistical point of view, the X(5) symmetry describes well the critical point behavior of nucleus undergoing a shape transition from U(5) dynamical symmetry to SU(3) dynamical symmetry which involves competing degrees of freedom.

In X(5) symmetry the nucleus exhibits chaotic spectrum, which is probably caused by the comparable competing strengthes in the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ degrees. The two maxima appearing in the NSD statistics suggest that the spectrum splits into two different sequences, one is rotational and the other is vibrational. Such a behavior illustrates that the nucleus in X(5) symmetry is at the critical point of the transition from spherical to axially-deformed shape with competing degrees of freedom. While the statistics in $\\mathrm { E } ( 5 )$ symmetry provides no evidence for such a drastic competition in the critical shape. That might be because the $\\mathrm { E } ( 5 )$ symmetry is a critical symmetry corresponding to an isolated point of second order phase transition. Very recently, it has been pointed out that such a second-order phase transition located at the triple-point of the three phases[29]. The shape coexistence region shrinks[1] as the parameter $\\chi$ in the Casten's triangle changes from $- { \\sqrt { 7 } } / 2$ to O. In deed, as a general rule, phase coexistence can be found only in first-order phase transitions[30]. There is no shape coexistence in $\\mathrm { E } ( 5 )$ symmetry and the spectrum does not split into two sequences, then no competition exists and its statistics is uniform(no two maxima in the NSD statistics).

The statistics of E(5) symmetry is regular. That is probably caused by the common subgroup O(5) in the U(5)-O(6) transition.
